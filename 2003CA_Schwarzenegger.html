President George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain follow suit, among others. <p><p>Keep in mind that the state legislature is fairly Democratic, therefore some of your ideas for the future of California could be rather difficult to implement.

However, you could also focus on continuing your action film career. Terminator 3 was a hit in the box office, so it's likely that movie lovers are happy that you can stay in the film industry. <p><p>For now, just sit back, relax, and enjoy whatever the future holds for you.
