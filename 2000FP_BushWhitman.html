In the room, were President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. \"I BROUGHT THE ECONOMY BACK FROM A TERRIBLE STATE RUN BY INCOMPETENT REPUBLICANS. I WON DURING THE MID-TERMS AND GAVE YOU A FREE TICKET TO THE PRESIDENCY. THROUGH THE PRIMARY FOR GODS SAKE. AND WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU LET THE GUY WHO I BEAT BECOME PRESIDENT DEFEATING THE LAST DISGRACED DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT! 538 VOTES TO 0!\" Those were the words of a less than happy Bill Clinton. Gore responded \"I-I don't know what happened, I-I thought I ran a good campaign in the primary b-but...\" Clinton interrupted, saying 'You know exactly what happened Gore. You did a tank photo op like Dukakis, BUT THEN you accidentally fired the tank and you hit a group of spectators. Killing 5. Your court date is in a month so you better start prepping a defense team.\" \"co-\" \"If you’re asking me for a pardon, you can shove it. Then in your speech to the nation about it, you claimed the ghost of Richard Nixon had fired the tank by controlling your body. You then spent $50,000 of taxpayer money on hiring an exorcist to try and remove him. That’s why you lost the primary, Al. Jimmy Carter was such a miserable failure, and you gave him the primary because of all of your stupid bullcrap.\"</p>",
