The world was shook on the 23rd of June 2016 when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, the first time that a country had voted to do such a thing. In the wake of the results, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned the Premiership, setting up a Conservative leadership election that would determine who would carry the country forwards into the negotiations with the EU. Theresa May ultimately would end up winning this leadership election, giving her the keys to 10 Downing Street to lead the country into its next tumultuous chapter. </p><p>Unfortunately for her however, her thin majority from Cameron’s 2015 victory splinters away, putting her in a situation where certain factions of the Conservative Party begin to obstruct. Stonewalled by a disunited party, but at the same time being gifted a massive lead in the polls, there doesn’t seem like any better time to call a snap election to grow her majority than right now.</p><p>It’s 2017. The Conservatives start in a very strong position, 20 points ahead of Labour, which has been languishing in its own even more intense disunity under their dark horse leader Jeremy Corbyn. With this being the case, a massive increase in her majority seems all but inevitable for the Tories.</p><p>Theresa May may have campaigned to Remain in 2016, but nevertheless, the party chose her over her closest rival for leadership, the Leave-voting Andrea Leadsom. All she has to do is keep her lead. That can’t be too hard in this political environment, right?</p><p>Jeremy Corbyn is an interesting figure in his own right. After the resignation of Ed Miliband after losing the 2015 general election, the party’s membership nominated the 100-1 odds choice through their own new democratic selection system established by the previous leader, Ed Milband. This marked a dramatic shift from the Third Way centrist leanings of New Labour, now Labour has returned with an aggressive pivot back to its hard-left and socialist legacy. Corbyn may be low in the polls, but he has a secret weapon that Theresa May and the Conservatives don’t have, an extremely vibrant grassroots supporter base. Could this be what carries him from relative obscurity only 2 years ago all the way into Number 10?</p><p>It must hurt to see what was such a prosperous third political option be reduced to merely a single-digit number of seats in 2015. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had all but failed his own party, his voters furious about a myriad of issues that the party betrayed. Clegg resigned in shame, only for the party’s next leader Tim Farron left to pick up the pieces, and figure out what he can do to resuscitate a party that has been so thoroughly annihilated by his predecessor. </p>\", \"image_url\": \"https://file.garden/Zmvf_kGfBgouz-z5/2017%20UK%20images/Intro.jpeg\", \"winning_electoral_vote_number\": 326, \"advisor_url\": \"https://file.garden/Zmvf_kGfBgouz-z5/2017%20UK%20images/AdvisersMay.png\", \"recommended_reading\": \"<div style=\\\"overflow-y:scroll;height:357.133px;font-size:1em;\\\"><h3 style='margin-top: 0.5em;'>Learn More about the 2017 UK General Election</h3><h4 style='margin-top: 0.5em;'>2017 General Election Party Manifestos</h4><a href='https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/conservative-party-manifestos/Forward+Together+-+Our+Plan+for+a+Stronger+Britain+and+a+More+Prosperous....pdf'>Forward, Together: Our Plan for a Stronger Britain and a More Prosperous Future, Conservative Party </a><br><a href='https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf'>For the Many, Not the Few, Labour Party</a><br><a href='https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5909d4366ad575794c000000/attachments/original/1495020157/Manifesto-Final.pdf?1495020157'>Change Britain's Future, Liberal Democrats</a><br><a href='https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ukipdev/pages/3944/attachments/original/1495695469/UKIP_Manifesto_June2017opt.pdf?1495695469'>Britain Together, UKIP</a><br><a href='https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/gp2017/greenguaranteepdf.pdf'>The Green Party for a Confident and Caring Britain, Green Party of England and Wales</a><br><a href='https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thesnp/pages/9544/attachments/original/1496320559/Manifesto_06_01_17.pdf?1496320559'>Stronger for Scotland, SNP</a><br><a href='https://manifesto.deryn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Plaid_Cymru_-_Defending_Wales_-_2017_Action_Plan.pdf'>Tarian Cymru (Defending Wales): 2017 Action Plan, Plaid Cymru</a><h4>Extra Information</h4><a href='https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7979/CBP-7979.pdf'>House of Commons Library: Results and Analysis</a><br>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://assets-learning.parliament.uk/uploads/2020/05/HOC-Chamber-940x720.jpg\"}}]");
