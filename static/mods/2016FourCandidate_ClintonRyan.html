What the fuck?</h3><span id='ending0' style='display: initial;'><p>Your eyes nearly glaze over the television in the center of your campaign headquarters as you look towards Robby Mook to ask what’s going on, but you’re eyes quickly dart back to the television. You’re shocked as you see projections from CNN of Trump victories in Texas, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, states that should’ve been between you and Rubio. You see Rubio at the bottom of a graph of electoral votes, behind Bernie Sanders of all people. and finally, you look towards the chyron, reading 'Donald J. Trump Presumptive President-Elect.' You had assumed, perhaps naively, that whoever had yelled that out had been joking, or perhaps panicked over a contingent election. But an outright victory?<p><p> No, no, no, you tell yourself. The whole <em>point</em> of boosting Trump was to get yourself ahead in these red states, in these swing states. But it looks like you may have boosted him far <em>too</em> much. You freeze. Rubio might have been a conservative, one very much running against your goals, but at least he was sane. And Trump wasn’t gaining that much in the polls. This? After the Access Hollywood tape? After the most unserious and attacking campaign in Presidential history? After unified opposition from any reasonable people in government, and most of the unreasonable ones too? Dear god.<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>What would his administration even look like? Does he even have a cabinet bench? He’s teased appointing his own family to many major positions: Ivanka at the UN, Jarad Kushner at the State department. But those are dead on arrival in the now-undecided Senate, even positions like defense, if his plans of appointing Michael Flynn to Defense turn out true. He’d have to make deals with congress, with many of the Republicans who hate him. As you look toward the TV, now at a house map, you’re surprised when you see some Trump-backed third party candidates winning, with a constitution party candidate taking a house seat in Idaho, and Joe Miller taking out Lisa Merkowski in Alaska. He'll have a few allies, but certainly not enough. You hope so, at least. <br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>As for your legacy, it’s certainly a dark one. Many on both sides of the blame yourself, oddly enough, for Trump’s victory. Your strategy of boosting Trump is seen as having spectacularly backfired, and many of the Trump administrations decisions will be pinned on you. Those who supported you, however, put the blame towards Bernie Sanders, declaring him a spoiler candidate for Trump, who prevented your landslide victory. No matter who wins that debate in the Democratic Party, your political career is over. Get ready for retirement. If you feel like it, you can write a memoir about what happened, but this was your last shot for the Presidency. You can only hope that the Trump administration ends with an upside for Democrats, or at least that it hurts Republicans, whose Presidential nominee was in dead last, even further.</i><br><br><button onclick='backe1()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;";

That can’t be right. In New York? In Pennsylvania and Michigan? In <em>Ohio</em>?! And yet it is. A third party candidate, who lost the primary, who was an open socialist, will be the next President of the United States. Despite everything.

You see the Senator- no, the President-elect walk into frame, waving with his wife. He thanks his supporters, he thanks yourself for conceding. He says that his political revolution is onto it’s next stage, as if he’ll even get his cabinet through the Senate, as if he thinks this Congress can pass Medicare for All. Ridiculous.

A repeal of Obamacare is almost certainly in the works, along with a secure conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and Rubio will likely try to go even further than that, having his surrogates tout his 'commanding mandate' on a few of the networks.

You see Rubio at the bottom of a graph of electoral votes, behind Bernie Sanders of all people. and finally, you look towards the chyron, reading 'Donald J. Trump Presumptive President-Elect.' You had assumed, perhaps naively, that whoever had yelled that out had been joking, or perhaps panicked over a contingent election. But an outright victory?<p><p> No, no, no, you tell yourself. The whole <em>point</em> of boosting Trump was to get yourself ahead in these red states, in these swing states. But it looks like you may have boosted him far <em>too</em> much. You freeze. Rubio might have been a conservative, one very much running against your goals, but at least he was sane. And Trump wasn’t gaining that much in the polls. This? After the Access Hollywood tape? After the most unserious and attacking campaign in Presidential history? After unified opposition from any reasonable people in government, and most of the unreasonable ones too?

He’d have to make deals with congress, with many of the Republicans who hate him. As you look toward the TV, now at a house map, you’re surprised when you see some Trump-backed third party candidates winning, with a constitution party candidate taking a house seat in Idaho, and Joe Miller taking out Lisa Merkowski in Alaska.

Those who supported you, however, put the blame towards Bernie Sanders, declaring him a spoiler candidate for Trump, who prevented your landslide victory. No matter who wins that debate in the Democratic Party, your political career is over. Get ready for retirement. If you feel like it, you can write a memoir about what happened, but this was your last shot for the Presidency.

Your road to the White House is murky, but you still have an outside shot of victory.<p><p> As for the Senate, which elects the Vice President, it's a mess: Democrats have managed to flip four key states, taking it to a tie. Luckily, since Bernie placed second, Ryan's opponent will be Tulsi Gabbard. It's basically unimaginable that any Republican will vote Tulsi, and despite McConnell hoping for his caucus to abstain, it seems like a flip to Ryan from the likes of Susan Collins or Lisa Merkowski is likely: you'll likely need both if Bernie Sanders or another progressive Senator decides to vote for his running mate. If you manage to clear the House, you may also have a Vice President on your side for the duration of your term, which is always a good thing.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Be ready to dig in and prepare for January, and start calling Pelosi and others in Congress.

McConnell would prefer that his caucus choose neither, hoping that whoever's in office come January 20th will be forced to go with a more conservative choice. Some moderates prefer to pick Ryan, though, so it's unclear whether the Senate will be deadlocked. If you manage to clear the House, you may have a Vice President on your side for the duration of your term, which is always a good thing. Otherwise, Ryan could burnish a run in 2020 by serving as a more rational counter-weight to Trump.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Be ready to dig in and prepare for January, and start calling Pelosi and others in Congress.
