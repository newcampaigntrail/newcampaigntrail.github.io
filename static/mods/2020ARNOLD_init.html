This is officially the end of the Arnold Schwarzenegger trilogy, starting with the 2003 California Recall Election, then the 2016 Arnold Amendment Redux, and now this mod. On a personal note, Arnold Schwarzenegger is my favorite actor because he was the Governor of my state of California, and he is a pretty funny guy. I also like him as a politician, since he is a sensible-enough Republican for my tolerance in spite of being very supportive of George W. Bush in 2004. But for now, there are currently two sides to this mod, and the Trump side should be coming in April 2024 at some point, so stay tuned for that. After that, I'll be taking a bit of a break from modding to get past my high school graduation. But stay tuned for any future projects and announcements from Environmental_Cap104. Thanks, everyone! <br><br>",
