I am so, so sorry that 2020: Arnold Amendment only functioned on CTS. It's just that I used the wrong base scenario when I should've used 2000 because 2000 has three candidates playable. Now that I made that change, 2020: Arnold Amendment should now be playable and compatible with the TNCT mod loader. But anyways, production of 2024: Arnold Amendment will begin in December because I need to take a short break from modding to focus on my first semester of college. I would expect the mod to be released in early 2025 at some point. Stay tuned for future announcements regarding 2024: Arnold Amendment and more!</p><p>-Environmental_Cap104</p> <br><br>",
