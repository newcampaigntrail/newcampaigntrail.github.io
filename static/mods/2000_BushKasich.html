There was a time when victory didn't just seem possible, but inevitable. It's over now, though. You'll go down in history as a failed candidate. A failure. No. You can't. Not after all you've done. Not after defeating Ann Richards. Not after defeating Garry Mauro. Not after defeating John McCain. ESPECIALLY not after how close this race was. \n\nOne day, some day, you'll win the presidency, and you'll prove the critics wrong. You'll impress your father. No matter what. Good luck, Mr. Bush.",
