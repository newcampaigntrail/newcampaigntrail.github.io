One that always stood for peace, that improved worker’s conditions, that improved people’s lives, that ‘Dared More Democracy’.

You’d think they didn’t have a lot of leverage due to their middling performance, but with their steadfast non-interventionist Foreign Policy, the coalition talks were quite tough. Most days of the several months you’ve taken to negotiate were spent on that topic, while the others forged an unabashedly leftist policy regime, consisting of the abolition of Hartz IV, the reintroduction of the wealth tax, a federal rent moratorium, a minimum wage of 12.50€, a unitary health insurance system and a complete rethinking of the economic consensus, particularly ecologically. In the end, you did it - you got the Left to acknowledge the “current status of NATO membership”, shelving most discussions about Foreign Policy until it’s relevant. <br>Finally, the influence of the <i>Parliamentarian Left</i> in your party has reached it’s peak, with a lot of Jusos entering the parliament, determined to make the most of this coalition. The CDU/CSU and FDP already have put up the redbaiting barricades, preparing to obstruct and sue wherever possible - and with your own moderate wings unnerved, you have a lot of work to do. <i>Scholz I</i> will be a difficult test of your political ability. ."

No, the danger was in the politics: Baerbock didn’t have the votes on the first ballot. And it wasn’t a fluke - the second ballot was just as inconclusive.
