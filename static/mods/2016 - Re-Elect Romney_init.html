Riding on a wave of discontent with the administration, he entered the White House with a (albeit slimmed down) majority in Congress, but his job was going to be far from easy. 4 years on, that's clear to be seen.<br><br>The moderate conservative incumbent will have to defend his record and prove that America is better off under him than it was under Obama ─ that it was the right choice to say no to universal healthcare, that it paid off to be well engaged in foreign affairs ─ to be a \"foreign policy president\", that increasing taxes and spending after promising the opposite was necessary. But with former Vice-President Joe Biden his likely opponent, a difficult race lies ahead ─ can Mitt pull off re-election, or will the United States have two consecutive one-term presidents?",

While he seemed like the perfect fit for an angered country, his years in office have left a lot to look for. Under his focus on foreign policy, taxes and government spending went up. The United States now finds itself involved in countless wars, and, frankly, many Americans are wondering: what's the point? The battle for re-election is an uphill one.</p>",

Really, for most countries, he's quite radical. But this is the United States, so he appeals to moderates.
