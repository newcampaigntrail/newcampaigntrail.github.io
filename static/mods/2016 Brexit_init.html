Two organisations have been founded within 4 days of each other reflecting the two sides of this wider debate, whether to remain in the EU, or to leave the EU.

They of course don’t want to vote for a leftist like Jeremy Corbyn, but they’re also turned off by Theresa May’s Brexit stances. Thus some strategists suggest running the Liberal Democrats as a party for these upper class professionals to gather around. This will be good for campaign influence as many wealthy people who fit into this niche have large amounts of political capital at their disposal. However, leaning too hard into it might alienate the big tent that the Liberal Democrats have at their disposal. Running with this strategy will also make you much more likely to be endorsed by business focused news outlets and boost your appeal with the wealthy professional class.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 218, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Christian\", \"last_name\": \"Liberal Democrat\", \"election\": 20, \"party\": \"Liberal Democrats\", \"state\": \"Westminster\", \"priority\": 20, \"description\": \"'\", \"color_hex\": \"#00C100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#A1FFA1\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/nLzMBHI.png\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"'\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"'\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"'\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<p>Due to your prominent Christian background, some suggest you can lean into a unique direction for a Liberal Democrat to take their campaign.

Within this Christian direction for your campaign, you could take this in a more conservative direction, or a more progressive one, using the words of Christ to guide your campaign in the way you see as most fit to bring the party back from the depths that Nick Clegg has pulled it down to. However, leaning too heavily into your Christian background might turn away some irreligious younger people, and invite questions about some controversial statements you made a couple of years ago.
