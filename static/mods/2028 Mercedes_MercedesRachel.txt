<p>Defying every prediction, Mercedes and the Independent Woman Party have won the 2028 presidential election. Born in Persia and raised in the United States, her candidacy only became possible after the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment passed in 2026. Her outsider message, shaped by years working in retail and speaking directly to everyday frustrations, has resonated across the country. Tonight, history is made as Mercedes becomes the first president elected under the new amendment — and the first to break the two-party hold in generations.</p>
<p>However, the House and Senate remain firmly Democratic. Good luck trying to pass any bills.</p>`;

<p>Mercedes’s historic journey comes to an end tonight without a victory. The Independent Woman Party could not overcome the combined strength of Andy Beshear and Vice President J.D. Vance. Yet her story — born in Persia, raised in America, and finally able to run after the 2026 amendment — has reshaped expectations of what is possible. Many believe this won’t be the last time the country hears from her.</p>
<p>If you deadlocked the Electoral College, Then Beshear would most likely be the next president. You could run again in 2032 though.</p>`;
