You have lost the 2022 Pennsylvania Gubernatorial election.</h3><p>Given the enviorment favored Republicans, this isn't the biggest upset, but Mastriano's extreme stances made this the less likely possibility. Republicans now have unified control of Pennsylvania's government (save for the Supreme Court), and will act accordingly, passing a variety of conservative policies. You're still Attorney General for at least 2 years, (meaning you can sue the Legislature or Mastriano if they go too far), but past that, your political career seems to likely be over after this loss.</p><p>Many Democrats are worried that Mastriano will refuse to accept if Biden or any Democrat wins the Keystone State in 2024, along with Mastriano's early plans as Governor to search for 'election integrity'. As many of your supporters worried that Pennsylvania's democracy was at stake in this election, what now? Only time will tell.</p>"
