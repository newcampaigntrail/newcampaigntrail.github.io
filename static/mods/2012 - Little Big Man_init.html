                <p><b>Fun fact:</b> this mod started out as a sandbox for another mod.</p>
                <p>When working on <i>2016: A Lifetime of This</i>, I ended up doing some snooping and was able to
                    recover most of the original chunk of questions for the 2012 mod; for those unaware, the original
                    2012 Dan Bryan scenario had about ~80 or so questions, and in the early stages of the game you could
                    have an option to answer those 80 questions if you wanted (or a smaller number, like 40 or 60
                    questions). I tested these out in the original 2012 mod and it worked fairly well, though I ended up
                    making my own adjustments to it for easier loading. A few changes here and there, and I realized I
                    got too carried away. But by then, I already had a lot of stuff that I just couldn’t slap on top of
                    2016ALOT, and I decided to work on what eventually became “Little Big Man”.</p>
				<p>Honestly, working on this was very fun, especially when curating this mod’s soundtrack. Hopefully, you have enjoyed
					some of the music choices here (or the volume slider at 0%, which also works out well). I never thought I
					would make a mod so soon after 2016ALOT, and so I’m happy that I was able to dedicate myself at least more
					than a bit to this funny mod. I especially appreciate the warm welcome that I received from the communit
					during my stay here. You guys rock!</p>
                <p class="overview-note">I do need to disclose that this is, probably, my last standalone scenario. It has been quite a ride,
                    but it’s also been very stressful at times, particularly because most of this was the work of a
                    one-person team. You might see me work with someone on a future mod, but this may be my last
                    standalone mod for a while. Regardless, I do hope I’ve been able to live up to your expectations of
                    this mod, as low as they might’ve been.</p>

                <p class="reading-description">
                    An excellent analysis of the 2012 campaign. It argues that despite the daily drama of the campaign
                    trail, the election's outcome was largely determined by political and economic fundamentals, like
                    the state of the economy and presidential approval, and not by the so-called "game changers"
                    mentioned throughout the campaign. Here is a snippet:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="reading-quote">
                    As the 2012 campaign got under way, there were at least three bets being made. One was by Democrats,
                    who were betting on an incumbent who, while arguably the favorite, was still facing challenging
                    economic times and a pessimistic public. One was by Republicans, who were betting on which of their
                    many candidates could do something rare: defeat a sitting incumbent president. And one was by
                    voters, who were betting on which candidate would best help the country recover from the worst
                    economic recession in over seventy years.

                    Another quite useful read, this books talk about how the 2012 election changed the course of
                    American politics, and also the impacts it had on America’s electoral process. Here is a snippet:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="reading-quote">
                    It was not an uplifting campaign by any stretch of the imagination. At times the plain nuttiness of
                    it all cried out for Hunter S. Thompson to chronicle it. But both as political theater and as a
                    window into the struggle between where America has been and where it may be going, it was as
                    engaging as it was instructive about the state of our politics.

                    Michelle bore the brunt of all this, shuttling between mothering and work, unconvinced that she was doing either job well. At the end of each night, after feeding and bath time and story time and cleaning up the apartment and trying to keep track of whether she’d picked up the dry cleaning and making a note to herself to schedule an appointment with the pediatrician, she would often fall into an empty bed, knowing the whole cycle would start all over again in a few short hours while her husband was off doing “important things.”<br/><br/>We began arguing more, usually late at night when the two of us were thoroughly drained. “This isn’t what I signed up for, Barack,” Michelle said at one point. “I feel like I’m doing it all by myself.”

        <h4>Notes on the in-game code</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A couple of the features here (e.g. the tooltip system, the start screen menu, etc.) were taken from
                <i>2016: A Lifetime of This</i>. I do provide more explanation on the post-credits section there on what
                was rewritten for this mod and what was created from scratch.</li>
            <li>The Dossier system mechanic (that was also present in 2016ALOT) was inspired by the 1991 DOS game
                <i>Floor 13</i> (which can be played <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/floor-13-1eo/play-1eo"
                    target="_blank">here</a>), which allowed you to do a variety of tools, from interrogating subjects
                to abducting them to ransacking places to discrediting their reputation. It was a game I especially
                played a lot, so I’m happy with how it turned out here. (A more family-friendly version of it was
                implemented on this mod.) This time, though, the layout for the Dossier was loosely inspired by that of
                <i>Divided States of America</i>, and also hit mod <i>Unburdened By What Has Been</i>. It was meant to look
				similar to Astro’s Campaign Headquarters feature (which is used in both mods), and many thanks to him for it!
            </li>
			<li>The data visualizer you see here was actually made for this mod! I should point out though that a good chunk
			of the tabs added to it were added by routevenus, and used for testing both <i>1972: More Than Ever</i> and <i>
			Projec 2024</i>, and eventually I decided to use an adapted version of the data visualizer used there for better
			ease of use. Thank you!</li>
            <li>The tabs system you’re seeing here was taken from <i>2004 Sundance</i>, used in 2016ALOT, and eventually
				reused for this mod. The question randomizer here, although technically using the same function as
                <i>bunnyhop</i>, is used in a different way because, just like in 2016ALOT, rewriting most of the mod for it was
				not a feasible idea. Finally, the checkbox styling you see here was partially taken from the one on that mod
                and changed for this one.</li>
            <li>Many of the images here were listed on sites such as Getty Images. This mod is primarily a
                humorous/educational mod, and we want to note these are being labeled as fair use of the respective
                material under United States copyright law.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Special thanks to…</h4>
        <ul>
			<li>The estate of <i>Aaliyah</i>, for refreshing the songs from the self-titled album Aaliyah (2001) only once, preventing me from having to update one of the songs used in this mod from time to time;</li>
			<li><i>Wyatt Mason</i>, for his excellent translation of Rimbaud's <i>A Season in Hell</i> (cited here);</li>
            <li><i>astrohuncho</i> — for the Further Reading Wizard, which I’m using to write this message as we speak;</li>
            <li><i>Jet</i> — for his excellent mod tool and for being fine with my fork of it;</li>
            <li>The man himself, <i>Dan Bryan</i> — for creating this neat educational game;</li>
            <li><i>Everyone who playtested this mod</i> — for, well, trying out this mod and sharing their feedback;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And of course, thanks to <b>you</b>, for taking the time to read all of this. :D I appreciate it!</p>

        <h4>Fun facts</h4>
        <p> Did you know? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Prior to working on this mod, I was tapped to work on a Biden '08 mod, which didn't really go anywhere because the three people on the team Were
			busy with other things. I did consider it for a couple of months but dropped it entirely when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/1m8ihet/mod_announcement_biden_08/" target="_blank">the same idea</a> was taken by another person.</li>
			<li>A very alpha version of Little Big Man, way before I was fully set on making it an actual mod, was posted on June 29, 2025, just six days after the release of A Lifetime of This. It had some similarities to the final design. <img src="https://file.garden/aNtAfG887DiA_7lO/2012LBM/lbm_alpha.png" width="75%" /></li>
			<li>The music player was based off a scrapped, buggy music player I considered for 2016ALOT. It was so broken that it looked like this. Curiously, some of the sample songs in here were re-used this for mod, although not all of them. Amen to that! I think the other unlisted songs here were The Greatest Romance Ever Been Gold, I Wanna Sex You Up (confirming this mod was initially made on freaky principles) and C'Est La Vie. <img src="https://file.garden/aNtAfG887DiA_7lO/2012LBM/lbm_alpha2.png" width="75%" /></li>

He argued with countless men using examples drawn from their other lives, sought voyages to disperse enchantments that had colonized his mind, and watched a consoling cross rise above a sea he came to love as if it were rinsing him of stain. <i>Bliss was my undoing, my remorse, my worm</i>, he said. <i>My life would always be too ungovernable to devote to strength and beauty</i>. <br/><br/> At times, Barack feels the very same way. Once the brightest light in the room, he now walks through it like a man half-remembering why he turned it on in the first place. <br/><br/> The dream of the campaign trail ended the second he stepped into the Oval Office. It was like he was trapped in a nightmare, and one specifically designed to break him. Obama’s evil double was on the cable news every night; it was a caricature built from soundbites and a lot of suspicion, primarily conservative. He was the devil incarnate, a fallen angel; his enemies were feasting on his flesh. Were they the same? In a country like this, it seemed like every choice was a wrong one; just some were less wrong than others. He would wake up at night, afraid the man from ’08 was a dream he was starting to forget. The world was a blur; the things that were clear in his dreams suddenly didn’t make sense anymore. <br/><br/> Now, in 2012, the landscape has shifted. The President is no longer a symbol of what could be (or what has been), but the custodian of a rather complicated and, at times, controversial record. There’s a kill list, there are drone strikes, there’s a healthcare bill whose promise has outpaced its rollout. Guantánamo is still open, and of course, there stand Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, looming over every vote like gargoyles. The writing is on the wall, and he read it. It’s a mad world. <br/><br/> The campaign trail feels different this time. His old lines don’t quite land with the same force. There seems to be a dissonance between the man who must now defend his compromises and the movement he once inspired. Obama finds himself in a strange middle ground; he’s no longer the fresh-faced outsider the American public met in 2008, but also not yet a universally accepted leader. His campaign is, essentially, running on muscle memory, and not many are sure whether he is searching for a new narrative — or, rather, for a way to reignite the old one. <br/><br/> Perhaps his task is no longer to inspire a dream, but to defend a complicated reality. That question hangs in the air at every rally, in every strategy meeting: what is the story this time? How do you convince a tired and divided nation to give you four more years? <br/><br/> Barack? Hey, are you still with me? </p>",
            "summary": "<p> Three years after the media crowned him in 2008, things have not felt as exciting for little Barry. He has spent the last year watching the economic recovery elude him, seeing it turn a long slow drowning in jobs reports and foreclosures. He has also seen his efforts to be a transformational, post-partisan leader fall apart, as his agenda based on “redistributive justice” has crashed and burned in gridlocked Congress. </p> <p> Not knowing whether he will face Mitt Romney or one of the more beatable conservatives emerging from the GOP primary chaos, his future is wide open. Aside from his usual opponents, he must also contend with Congressional Democrats who are petrified at the prospect of defending his record. He must do all he can to ensure that he does not cede what little American credibility remains to an emboldened Putin and an ascendant China, and pray that the newly-registered Millennial phonekids can help him find the Chaos Emeralds one last time. </p>",

        LR_HARE: "7",

        BORDA_SL: "9",
        COPELAND_SL: "10",
    };

    const DESCRIPTIONS = {
        "1": `<p><strong>Use the default method of allocating electoral votes for each state.</strong></p>
          <p>In the winner-take-all system, the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives <em>all</em> of that state’s electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. For instance, if Candidate A defeats Candidate B in a state worth 20 electoral votes, Candidate A will win the 20 electoral votes. In the United States, this is how 48 out of 50 states currently operate (Maine and Nebraska use a district method).</p>
          <p>This system amplifies the importance of swing states while making “safe” states less influential in campaign strategy. It also makes it extremely difficult for third-party candidates to win any electoral votes, and has also resulted in popular vote winners losing the election. A good example of this is the election of 2000, where a razor-thin lead gave George Bush the state of Florida’s 25 electoral votes and the election, even as he lost the popular vote to Al Gore.</p>`,
        "2": `<p><strong>Allocate each state’s electoral votes proportionally.</strong></p>
          <p>Under the proportional system, each state’s electoral votes are distributed proportionally based on the popular vote percentage each candidate receives. If a candidate wins 60% of a state’s vote, they receive approximately 60% of that state’s electoral votes.</p>
          <p>The winner of a state still maintains an advantage due to rounding (in a state with 4 electoral votes, 51% of the vote typically yields 3 electoral votes), but the system much more closely reflects the will of the voters. It also makes every state more competitive, as candidates could gain electoral votes even in states they don’t win outright. This system would have changed the outcomes of several elections, including 1860, 1948, 1968, 1992, and 2000.</p>`,
        "3": `<p><strong style='color:navy'>From sea to shining sea!</strong> – you know how it is. Do the Bartman.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.DHONDT]: `<p><strong>D'Hondt/Jefferson method</strong></p><p>Similar to Sainte-Laguë, the D’Hondt method is a “highest averages” system that allocates seats one by one. However, it uses a different formula: a candidate’s total vote is divided by the number of seats they have already won, plus one (divisors: 1, 2, 3, etc.). The seat goes to the candidate with the highest average in each round.</p><p>This divisor sequence has a notable mathematical property: it tends to slightly favor larger parties and coalitions over smaller, more fragmented ones. This can encourage strategic alliances but may underrepresent minor parties compared to their vote share. It is named after Victor D'Hondt and, in the U.S., Thomas Jefferson.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.HUNTINGTON_HILL]: `<p><strong>Huntington-Hill method</strong></p><p>This is the method currently used to apportion the 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives among the states. Like other “highest averages” systems, it awards seats one by one to the party with the highest “priority value.”</p><p>Its unique formula (dividing votes by the geometric mean of seats currently held and the next seat) is designed to minimize the relative percentage difference in representation between any two parties. This means if one party gets twice the votes, it should have as close to twice the seats as mathematically possible. It generally produces very proportional results, somewhere between D'Hondt and Sainte-Laguë in its treatment of smaller parties.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.LR_HARE]: `<p><strong>Largest remainder method (Hare quota)</strong></p><p>This method works differently from “highest averages.” First, it establishes a “quota” — the price of a single electoral vote (calculated as Total Votes / Total EVs). Each candidate is immediately awarded a number of EVs equal to how many full quotas they achieved.</p><p>After this initial allocation, any remaining EVs are awarded one by one to the candidates with the largest <em>fractional remainder</em> of votes. This system is very intuitive and tends to be highly proportional, often giving smaller parties a better chance to win representation if they can consolidate their support to earn a large remainder.</p>`,		
        [METHOD_VALUE.SAINTE_LAGUE]: `<p><strong>Sainte-Laguë/Webster method</strong></p><p>This is a “highest averages” method that allocates a state’s electoral votes one by one. In each round, a candidate’s total popular vote is divided by a number (specifically, twice their current number of seats, plus one: 1, 3, 5, etc.). The seat is awarded to the candidate with the highest resulting average.</p><p>The Sainte-Laguë method is renowned for its high degree of proportionality. Unlike some other systems, it does not systematically favor larger or smaller parties, making it one of the most balanced apportionment methods available.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.APPROVAL_SL]: `<p><strong>Approval + Sainte-Laguë</strong></p><p>This is an advanced, model-based method that does <em>not</em> use the popular vote directly. Instead, it first calculates a “utility score” for each candidate based on their policy alignment with a state’s profile. A state then “approves” of all candidates whose utility is within a certain threshold of the top-scoring candidate.</p><p>The number of approvals each candidate receives becomes their new score; the Sainte-Laguë method is used to apportion electoral votes based on these approval counts. This system rewards candidates with broad ideological appeal who are considered a “good fit” by the state, not just the single best one.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.BORDA_SL]: `<p><strong>Borda count + Sainte-Laguë</strong></p><p>This model-based method first ranks candidates in a state from best to worst based on their policy alignment (creating a utility score for them). Candidates are then awarded Borda points based on their rank: the top-ranked candidate gets the most points, the second-ranked gets fewer, and so on.</p><p>These Borda points — and not popular votes — are then used as the input for the Sainte-Laguë apportionment method. This system heavily favors consensus candidates who are consistently ranked highly and penalizes polarizing figures who may be ranked first by some but last by others. It rewards being broadly acceptable over being a niche favorite.</p>`,
        [METHOD_VALUE.COPELAND_SL]: `<p><strong>Condorcet/Copeland + Sainte-Laguë</strong></p><p>This advanced method simulates a round-robin tournament in each state. Based on policy utility scores, every candidate is compared head-to-head against every other candidate. A candidate’s “Copeland score” is the total number of these pairwise matchups they win.</p><p>A candidate who can defeat every other opponent in a one-on-one contest is a “Condorcet winner” and will have the highest possible score. The Copeland scores are then used with the Sainte-Laguë method to allocate electoral votes. This system strongly favors candidates with the broadest appeal who are most likely to be preferred over their direct competitors.</p>`,

      <p> <b>French poet Arthur Rimbaud</b>, almost seven score ago, <a href="https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/%C5%92uvres_(Rimbaud)/Une_saison_en_enfer/Vierge_folle,_L%E2%80%99%C3%A9poux_infernal" target="_blank">once wrote</a> that he became opera, that he saw all living things were doomed to bliss — but that wasn’t living, just a way to waste what we have. He argued with countless men using examples drawn from their other lives, sought voyages to disperse enchantments that had colonized his mind, and watched a consoling cross rise above a sea he came to love as if it were rinsing him of stain. <i>Bliss was my undoing, my remorse, my worm</i>, he said. <i>My life would always be too ungovernable to devote to strength and beauty</i>. </p>
	  <p> At times, Barack feels the very same way. Once the brightest light in the room, he now walks through it like a man half-remembering why he turned it on in the first place. </p>
	  <p> The dream of the campaign trail ended the second he stepped into the Oval Office. It was like he was trapped in a nightmare, and one specifically designed to break him. Obama’s evil double was on the cable news every night; it was a caricature built from soundbites and a lot of suspicion, primarily conservative. He was the devil incarnate, a fallen angel; his enemies were feasting on his flesh. Were they the same? In a country like this, it seemed like every choice was a wrong one; just some were less wrong than others. He would wake up at night, afraid the man from ’08 was a dream he was starting to forget. The world was a blur; the things that were clear in his dreams suddenly didn’t make sense anymore. </p>
      <p> Now, in 2012, the landscape has shifted. The President is no longer a symbol of what could be (or what has been), but the custodian of a rather complicated and, at times, controversial record. There’s a kill list, there are drone strikes, there’s a healthcare bill whose promise has outpaced its rollout. Guantánamo is still open, and of course, there stand Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, looming over every vote like gargoyles. The writing is on the wall, and he read it. It’s a mad world. </p>
      <p> The campaign trail feels different this time. His old lines don’t quite land with the same force. There seems to be a dissonance between the man who must now defend his compromises and the movement he once inspired. Obama finds himself in a strange middle ground; he’s no longer the fresh-faced outsider the American public met in 2008, but also not yet a universally accepted leader. His campaign is, essentially, running on muscle memory, and not many are sure whether he is searching for a new narrative — or, rather, for a way to reignite the old one. </p>
      <p> Perhaps his task is no longer to inspire a dream, but to defend a complicated reality. That question hangs in the air at every rally, in every strategy meeting: what is the story this time? How do you convince a tired and divided nation to give you four more years? </p>
	  <p> Barack? Hey, are you still with me? </p>
