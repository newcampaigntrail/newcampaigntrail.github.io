Republicans are frustrasted that Mastriano possibly cost them a key Governor's seat, and for at least 4 years, a unified Republican government in Pennsylvania has been rejected. Republicans still hold narrow control of the State Legislature, but with fair redistricting giving a boost for the Democrats, they could perhaps take control of the Pennsylvania State Legislature some time this decade, maybe during a second term if you choose to run, which many are expecting.</p><p>While Republicans controlling the legislature means you won't get everything passed, you still have executive orders and other tools to get parts of your agenda done. Perhaps some moderate Republicans are looking to compromise, given their margins in the State House and Senate seem narrow. Regardless, get ready to move into the Governor's Mansion, and best of luck, Governor-elect Shapiro!</p>"

You're still Attorney General for at least 2 years, (meaning you can sue the Legislature or Mastriano if they go too far), but past that, your political career seems to likely be over after this loss.</p><p>Many Democrats are worried that Mastriano will refuse to accept if Biden or any Democrat wins the Keystone State in 2024, along with Mastriano's early plans as Governor to search for 'election integrity'.
