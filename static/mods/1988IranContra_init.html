His vice president, George Bush, also resigned following his own implication in the scandal. According to the presidential line of succession, Speaker of the House Jim Wright of Texas has taken the oath of office and has become the 42nd President. He has formed a unity Cabinet comprised of both Republicans and Democrats, and pledges to lead America through this time of crisis. Despite the chaos, the 1988 Presidential Election is still scheduled to take place. The Democrats ultimately chose to renominate President Wright, despite some tensions within the party. President Wright must now find a way to keep his party united while attracting moderates if he hopes to remain in office for another four years.</p><p><ul><li>The Republicans are demoralised after Iran-Contra, and need to nominate someone with no close connection to the Reagan administration to distance themselves from the whole affair.  They eventually nominate James R. Thompson, the moderate Governor of Illinois.</li><li>The race is set as Wright vs Thompson. Wright is leading in the polls as the election approaches; campaign issues include Iran-Contra, escalating Cold War tensions, and the economic legacy of Reaganomics.</li></p></div>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/President_Ronald_Reagan_meets_with_aides_on_Iran-Contra.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/G.W._Bush_delivers_State_of_the_Union_Address.jpg/250px-G.W._Bush_delivers_State_of_the_Union_Address.jpg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1988,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1988IranContra"}];e.credits = "jackreacher2975.";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":153,"fields":{"first_name":"Jim ","last_name":"Wright","election":15,"party":"Democrat","state":"Texas","priority":1,"description":"Jim Wright was elected to serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1987, after a lengthy career in the House representing Texas’ 12th congressional district. Before that, Wright served with distinction in the Pacific theater in World War Two as a military aviator, and enjoyed a brief business career working in marketing. <br><br>In the aftermath of Reagan and Bush’s shock resignations, the presidential succession has defaulted to Wright, and he has now moved into the White House. Wright must now fight to overcome the unique constitutional circumstances of his inauguration to prove to the American people that he has the qualities to make a strong President, and try and move America on from the Iran-Contra scandal. Fortunately, Wright benefits from a broadly united Democratic base, while the public are sceptical but nonetheless willing to give a Wright Presidency a fair hearing. On the other hand, Wright’s Republican opponents are deeply divided and demoralised after Iran-Contra, and have reached the cusp of splitting altogether into competing factions. If Wright can stay the course and successfully exploit the problems his Republican foes are experiencing, he may well be rewarded with another five years in the Oval Office.","color_hex":"#0000ff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://library.tcu.edu/spcoll/img/wright-jim.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>The Wright Stuff!</h3><p>With Iran-Contra and a divided Republican base, you were always the favourite to win this contest. Still, that shouldn’t take away from the importance of your achievement here. Despite never having won a national election before, you have successfully persuaded the American people to give you a full term in office. Your mandate is especially impressive, considering the strange constitutional circumstances of your ascent from the House Speakership to the Presidency. </p><p>As for your second term, a number of paths are now open to you. You can negotiate with the Soviets and attempt to decisively wind down the Cold War for good, bring about more transparency in government, and generally lean the country in a more progressive direction. Alternatively, depending on your election strategy, you could adopt a slightly more conservative tone, while still eschewing Reagan’s political style. For the moment, though, it’s time to head back to Forth Worth and crack open a nice cold beer at your victory party with Betty and the family. Well done, Mr. President. Here’s to the next four years! </p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Wright Gone Wrong?</h3><p>At first, when the evening news networks started calling the election for Thompson, you thought there had to be some kind of freak polling mistake. But no, it turns out that you somehow managed to lose, despite perhaps the most favourable electoral circumstances for a Democrat since LBJ’s famous trouncing of Barry Goldwater way back in 1964. </p><p>Tomorrow’s historians will take their guesses as to why you did this badly. Maybe you mishandled the tax issue, or you didn’t manage the fallout from Iran-Contra effectively. Whatever the reason, one thing’s clear: you lost this election. Pundits kept calling this race a change election after Reagan’s scandals, but maybe, when it came down to it, the American people didn’t want to change that much at all. <p>And that, in the end, is what stings the most for you. In the context of Iran-Contra and Nicaragua and all the rest of it, you had one chance to convince the American people to turn away from the scandals of Reagan and Bush, and vote for something different. But you failed.  Instead, they cast their ballots for the same party as 1980 and 1984. An election that might have destroyed the Republican Party for years to come has instead spelled doom for your career in politics. That’s the hardest loss to take. </p>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>No candidate secured an Electoral College majority. </h3><p>You tried your utmost, but in the end, you couldn’t win enough electoral votes to secure another term as President. On the advice of your campaign lawyers, you have refused to concede, and Thompson has done likewise, while both of you attempt to figure out some kind of backroom deal in Congress. As a former Speaker, you know the dynamics of Congress like the back of your hand, yet the Republican Party has somehow emerged with more members of Congress than your party. Thompson will likely become the 43rd President, when all is said and done, but with multiple legal battles over the election set to dominate the next few months at least, the eventual outcome of the 1988 election remains unclear. Hopefully some sort of legal resolution can be found, otherwise things are going to get awkward in Washington. </p>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":152,"fields":{"first_name":"James R.","last_name":"Thompson","election":15,"party":"Republican","state":"Illinois","priority":1,"description":"COMING SOON <br> <br> James R. Thompson has served as Governor of Illinois since 1977, and is the most prominent Republican elected to office in this nationally important swing state. A former attorney and federal prosecutor who led a crackdown on corruption in Chicago in the 1970s, and even had a hand in the investigation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew on bribery allegations in 1973, Thompson has built up an impressive track record on law-and-order issues. He is also a highly experienced administrator, having served in executive office now for just over a decade as Governor. At first glance, “Big Jim”, as he is jocularly known in Illinois circles, appears to be a highly credible candidate for the Presidency.<br><br>However, Thompson is emphatically not a Reaganite, and has spoken out in favour of pro-choice views in the past. He has also raised taxes a couple of times in his state. However, with most nationally known Reaganites leaving the Republican Party in protest after Iran-Contra, a moderate figure like Thompson may prove to be the party’s best bet in this election. Thompson trails Wright in the polls as the race begins. Can “Big Jim” overcome the albatross around his neck that is Iran-Contra, and pull off a surprising victory this fall?<br>","color_hex":"#ff0000","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Governor_James_Thompson_3_%283x4%29.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>Thompson Triumphs! </h3><p>Well, this result was a surprise to everyone, including you. Despite having to contend with both the Iran-Contra scandal and a divided party base, you have ultimately pulled through and won this election for the Republicans. Maybe your particular brand of moderate centrism wasn’t as unappealing as some pundits made it out to be. Or maybe you took a different path, and managed to mend fences with the Reaganite conservative wing of the party somehow? Perhaps the country just wasn’t ready to vote for a more liberal administration led by Wright. The Democrats still control both Houses of Congress, however, so it would probably be a good idea to moderate on policy matters for the time being. Here’s to you, President Thompson. </p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Wright Set for Second Term! </h3> <p><h3>Wright Set for Second Term!</h3><p>In a result that nearly everyone saw coming, you have lost the 1988 presidential election. As you watch the last few states being called for Wright on TV, you reflect to yourself that, realistically, no Republican was likely to succeed in the hostile political climate generated by Iran-Contra, even without adding in your problems facing down a divided party base. Disappointed Reaganites will now be furious at what they view as a capture of ‘their’ party by Northern liberals, followed by a humiliating loss to a powerful Democratic incumbent. Perhaps a moderate, even slightly progressive figure like yourself will clinch the Republican nomination in 1992, but you know deep down that this is wishful thinking. The next GOP nominee is far more likely to be a retrograde conservative like Pat Robertson, riding a wave of pro-Reagan backlash against your failed candidacy. As for you, your national career is almost certainly over, but Illinois is waiting to welcome you back to the governor’s mansion.</p></p>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>No candidate secured an Electoral College majority!</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":154,"fields":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Sarbanes","election":15,"party":"Democrat","state":"Maryland","priority":1,"description":"Paul Sarbanes is a Senator from Maryland who served as an Iran-Contra committee member.
