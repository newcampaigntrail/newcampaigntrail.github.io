Running on a Lexiteer strategy would hurt you severely in London and Scotland. You are banking on doubling down on the Red Wall to not just hold up, but expand. However, you have an arsenal of economic populist arguments which could win over the working classes for areas that haven’t voted Labour for some time. In return, the Liberal Democrats or the Green Party could come hounding some of your Remain-voting seats. Running as a Lexiteer is a gamble and a balancing act.

Some party insiders might be more willing to work with you however. A lot of the establishment politicians and party insiders do not line up with the grassroots. They’re opposed to policies that poll popular with the British people. Trying to balance a functional united party with the popular policies isn’t going to be easy.
