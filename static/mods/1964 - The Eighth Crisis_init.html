Ted also helped make the wonderful themes, and they really are fantastic, so I'd want to thank him too. Thank you Kaiserlink for your fantastic writing on the Nutcutter ending (keep lookin for it if you haven't gotten it, there's an achievement, though the real reward is his awesome writing). Special thanks to Onkel Danny for fixing the massively bugged Scranton code lol, that was a huge boner on my part. Finally, thank you, the player, for playing this game.
