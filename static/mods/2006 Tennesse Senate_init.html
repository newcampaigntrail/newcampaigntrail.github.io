At the same time, he must ensure that conservatives remain firmly in his camp.<li>Harold Ford Jr. faces fundraising difficulties and a smaller voter base compared to Corker, but he seeks to harness the momentum of the Democratic \"blue wave\" to his advantage.",

He was first elected in 1996 to succeed his father. His family has been involved in Tennessee politics for a while, though they have also been tied to various dramas. In addition to this, Ford was the keynote speaker at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He challenged Nancy Pelosi to become the new House Democratic Leader. While he failed to beat her, he performed better than expected.<br><br>During his time as a congressman, Ford largely aligned with the Democratic Party. He voted for more gun restrictions, supported unions, and advocated for more drug rehabilitation reform, though he is somewhat pro-life. Ford is considered by himself and others to be fairly moderate on many issues, and he is a member of the Blue Dogs, a group of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.<br><br>Ford is now running for the Class 1 Senate seat following the retirement of Bill Frist. He faced no serious opposition in the primaries and won easily. However, Ford will have to overcome the growing Republican dominance in the state, which has voted Republican in the last two elections, even with a Tennessee Democrat on the ticket. Additionally, he has less money from fundraising compared to Bob Corker and his base is in the less populous western part of the state.<br><br>That said, it's not all gloomy for Ford, as he can easily attack Corker over the unpopular administration and is aided by the \"six-year itch.\"</div>",
