How will you keep the left in the fold?"], [351, "Your presidency started with a recession, as the \"dot&#8209;com bubble\" burst.<br>Giuliani has seized on this, hammering your economic record and unfavorably comparing it to Clinton-era prosperity.<br>How can you defend America's economic progress in recent years?"], [347, "Giuliani's running mate, Rick Santorum, has frequently attacked your record on abortion while on the stump. Santorum successfully got a partial-birth abortion ban through Congress in 2002, which you vetoed.<br>Has your stance changed on abortion?"], [344, "The internet is a rapidly emerging medium for political activism; a recent survey shows nearly 3-in-10 voters under 30 get their campaign news online, and an increasing number of candidates are leveraging the \"netroots\" to win elections.<br>What will your online outreach look like?"]];

How do you wish to clarify your stance on gay marriage?"], [365, "In his program for an expanded \"War on Terror,\" Giuliani advocates a stronger stance against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. You have conducted major air strikes on Iraq to stop any possible WMD programs, but Rudy is calling for active regime change.<br>How will you keep America safe from Saddam?"], [352, "Healthcare remains a key issue; although you passed a Patient's Bill of Rights, many in your party believe more is necessary, while Giuliani and other Republicans plan to weaken your reforms. What is your healthcare plan for the next four years?"], [353, "Giuliani's personal life is famously messy&nbsp;--&nbsp;he only recently divorced his second wife, Donna Hanover. His primary opponents loved to make a spectacle of Rudy's personal woes, but will you continue the mudslinging?"], [361, "Your first major domestic achievement was \"No Child Left Behind,\" a major education package combining strict accountability standards for public schools with federal support for teacher salaries.

How are these grants conducive to rebuilding Afghanistan?"], [363, "Afghan officials have an informal policy to protect the local opium fields, for fear of angering residents by destroying their cash crops.

How will you challenge his narrative?"], [385, "Labor unions have been longtime allies of your administration, but some labor leaders are frustrated with your administration's embrace of free trade and of stricter fuel economy standards. How will you ensure that labor stays in the fold?"], [382, "About a year ago, you passed hate crime legislation which contained special carve-outs to protect American Muslims. Giuliani has stayed quiet on this, but many of his surrogates claim that you are \"protecting terrorists.\" Will you comment?"], [1003, "Republicans have commonly criticized your reluctance to build a national missile defense system.<br>Giuliani, for one, claims this leaves us vulnerable to terrorism, and proposes withdrawing from the ABM Treaty with Russia.

In a stunning turnaround from just 3 years ago, Rudy Giuliani has bested you by a healthy margin, and will be the next President of the United States; one picked by Fox News, rather than the conscience and intelligence of the American people. They don't want better mileage; they just want Osama's head.</p><p>You work quickly to start the transition, inviting Rudy to the White House and cautioning him to be careful internationally, but he's already ignoring you. You can hand him all the classified briefings and memos you want, but he's made up his mind, and it seems that America has as well.</p><p>Retirement will give you time for new concerns. Maybe you can't stop Rudy from bombing Iran, but perhaps you can save a few polar bears and give talks about rising sea levels. At least your successor is guaranteed to vindicate you in time.</p>"

Congress is his, as is the White House. You can't even begin to process how this defeat happened. It's unthinkable to think that mentioning 9/11 at every opportunity could win him a landslide&nbsp;--&nbsp;but what else could it have been?</p><p>You prepare for the transition, waiting with bated breath for what Rudy does. He's already speaking about a Global War on Terror, about crushing Bin Laden. The humanitarian chaos in Afghanistan may be staggering, if your briefings are right. With Congress in his hands, much of your agenda is on the chopping block too.</p><p>Try to enjoy retirement as best as you can. Some are already comparing you to Jimmy Carter&nbsp;--&nbsp;pundits these days&nbsp;--&nbsp;but hopefully you'll have as fruitful of a time outside the White House as him.</p>"
