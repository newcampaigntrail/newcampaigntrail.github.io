After the aftermath of Rocky 64! and 1976AFTON, I decided to really focus on quality control this time, and so that meant doing stuff I wasn't comfortable with, such as the candidate banner changer. The idea of Humphrey running one last time came after November Mod Jam theme was revealed. In fact, this mod was originally going to be a Mod Jam, but I had so much fun creating it that I ended up finishing it before the Mod Jam deadline. There probably will be a Happy Warrior 84' but I also said there would be a 1968 Bennett, so don't have too much faith in me. I know that some events like the stroke, and electoral fraud seem shoehorned in to make the election seem crazy, but I do think I made enough allusions to both to give it the proper realistic implementation.
