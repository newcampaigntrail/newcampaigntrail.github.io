What this organization has seen is simple. We have been encouraged by so-claimed allies in the Stephenson administration during the ‘76 campaign that change in the course of the nation would occur. In the past months, this organization has seen no such change. Congress remains inactive and the War in China still rages on. The American people were promised change, it has been long enough without it.</p><p>It is ineffably obvious that it will be shown that on this day, like those that precede it - the press will tell the American people that our horizon cannot be better or more fertile - today on this day like many before it another massacre will be censored, more Americans will return home in body bags and more will find reliance on food banks and the charity of starving compassion.</p><p>The policy of the Free States has always been against this useless war that drives the United States away from victory and toward Armageddon.  We, along with the majority of Americans, were falsely led to believe by romantic comments from the '76 Stephenson campaign that the Democratic nominee held our same ideals- that war would not be a policy choice. Fools we were to believe them. The truth is that this so-called president has been determined to do nothing but sit behind the Resolute Desk and allow more sons to return home to their mothers confined to caskets and wheelchairs. The incumbent Administration is no more than a continuance of the curse of death that plagues America.<p>This nation has doomed itself on a course of ensured suicide- its leaders proudly driving the nation off the highest cliff they could possibly find. As for you and me, we are ignored once more and left to fend for ourselves and the only hope we are given is the concept of prayer. It is time to realize that prayer won't save you and the government won't change the current course. Nuclear war, and only nuclear war, is the future of the Government. I won't stand for it, and neither should you.</p><p>Why must we sit back and wait for the bomb to drop when the freedom of man dictates the ability to lead his or her own life? There is no justification to stand idly by any longer. We, the holders of the ideals of liberty and dreamers of a hopeful tomorrow, declare ourselves entirely emancipated from the corrupted government that occupies this nation's capital. It is time to shake off the yoke of a corporate oligarchic government and hold the rights of man above the rights of the CEO. This cannot and will not be done through futile means of working within the system.</p><p>All throughout America, every good honest man shall follow us and from California to Washington D.C. there shall be the loud ringing of revolution; when in a united voice the people decide to truly command their own future.</p><p>If you value your life, if you wish to secure a future for your children, join us. Come forth and bring your support. Free yourself before the government kills you in the fiery heat of atomic war. You have nothing to lose but your corporate chains.”<p>- December 23, 2077.</p>", "<h3>Along comes rolling The Great Death</h3><p>Perhaps I would not have left it if I knew what would become of my home. Maybe I would have listened to my Mom's protests to enlisting if I knew it would be the last I heard from her. Maybe, just maybe, if I did I wouldn't be all alone today.</p><p>There was no expectation to find anything on this scouting mission to Luoping County. It was a hunch just to give the appearance of useful soldiers aiding America toward her great victory. We headed out from our temporary base at Wenhua Villiage at 0400 hours. Myself and 10 other men began simply walking with orders to report back what we saw, all of us prayed to all-mighty God we saw nothing. Onwards we walked across empty fields until we reached Luoping at about 1200 hours. That's when any thoughts we had at that moment were quickly broken by the voice of our Wenhua camp reporting to us. It was a blunt and humble voice that broke the news, I'll never forget the words “I'm sorry boys, America's been hit by nuclear warheads. We don't know how badly, we have no further information. The war seems over.”</p><p>The reaction was far from united among myself and the other men. Some cried, some sat down silently, and some tried to just keep walking onward as if to walk away from the circumstances. As for me? I am not too prideful to say I did not weep, I wept for what must have been hours. I know in my heart that we now cannot leave China, and any home I once had has been graced by the hand of death. I know my Mom won't ever write me another letter, my Dad won't ever write that he's proud to tell his friends his son is in China.</p><p>I learned in some villages, many weeks ago, that some of the locals call American units “大死亡”, it means “The Great Death”. I suppose now we all suffer from a great death. I miss my mom, I miss my dad...I just want to go home.</p>"];

Had things gone as he hoped, peace might have been attainable. However, as the Ambassador spoke, in Beijing the military had couped the peace-faction in the government.
