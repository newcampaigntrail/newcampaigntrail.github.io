Nonetheless, a washed-up Elvis Presley, the giant of the 50s, had begun expressing an interest in politics by 1960, when he had returned from military service and was at the height of his popularity. Due to his young age he was unable to run for much office, but had found success in endorsing local candidates in Memphis, Nashville and Vegas, all cities he had a deep fondness for. As his movie career went down the dumpster by 1964, he had started considering serious ambitions to run for President on a Democratic ticket, despite his age. Regardless, his successful run as governor of Tennessee had proven that he has serious electability, and his efforts in catching up to trends in society, music and culture have also proven in showing him as the \"hip\" candidate, that nonetheless is God-Fearing and fully American in nature. By 1968, a fractured Democratic Party decided to take a bet with nominating Elvis as a unity candidate, especially as a way to placate some Southern States from outright hatred of the new Democrats. Will these qualities and his small, nearly nonexistent political experience be enough for Elvis Aaron Presley's latest bid, his biggest yet?</p></div>",

However, his star faded as he attempted to pursue a career in Hollywood as an actor. Unfortunately, it was all for nothing. The movies did not succeed and he went nowhere. Elvis had to think outside of the box to pull himself out of this period of stagnation.<br>However, the way he pulled himself out was through some unconventional means. In 1966, he declared himself a candidate in the Tennessee Gubernatorial Election and after fighting against the polls, the political machine in the state, he somehow won and entered the Governor's mansion in Nashville. During his brief tenure as Governor, he did experience some difficulties, but was able to keep things relatively normal and stable.<br>As 1968 dawned, Elvis saw the Democratic Party fracturing at the seems. With President Johnson having dropped out, and with figures like Gene McCarthy, Bobby Kennedy, and Vice President Humphrey in the race, there was no way Elvis would run, right? Well, he decided to launch his bid for President on March 20, 1968 in Nashville. No one really took his candidacy seriously, at first. However, through a lot of hard work and winning a few primaries, Elvis has found himself the nominee for the Democratic Party.<br>Now, it won't be easy. The Democratic Party is very divided, lacking a leader like FDR that can hold the Party together. Along with that, the Party seems to be fighting itself in regards to the issues of Vietnam and Civil Rights. While Northern Liberals fully support Civil Rights and want the War in Vietnam to end, Southern Conservatives fully oppose Civil Rights and want to keep up the fighting in Vietnam.<br>Elvis will have to walk the tightrope in order to win, or be washed away by Vice President Nixon...</div>",
