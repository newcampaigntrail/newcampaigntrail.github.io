You feel exhausted, after the long weeks of campaigning, but you can take comfort from the fact that you’ve now confounded the expectations of the pollsters twice over; first in 2000, and then again tonight. The pundits said you were on the ropes, a one-term calamity, but I guess they were wrong about that. As you watch the last few states being called in your favour on TV, you reflect on another surprise triumph at the ballot box. The House and Senate are still red, so you’ll have no trouble passing legislation, at least for the next couple of years. Strengthening campaign finance reform, and working out a long-term solution to Iraq’s difficulties, should be priorities for you to tackle.  Some kind of regulation for the financial sector could also feature in your agenda.  But if anyone can deal with these challenges, it’s probably the Maverick.

It’s difficult to tell how history will judge your presidency; you reacted to the initial aftermath of 9/11 with grace and dignity, but your intensely controversial foreign policy choices over the past year likely tarnished your image among voters.

Mark Salter tells you to cheer up; after all, you’re still the President, and both Reagan and Clinton managed to cope just fine with being lame-duck incumbents during their respective second terms.
