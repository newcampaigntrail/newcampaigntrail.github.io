The result of the election - the least desirable, the one no-one wanted. It’s not over. That damnable man, George Wallace, has done what he’s promised to do. There is no covenant for you, or Humphrey, and it seems completely laughable to succumb to the demands of the segregationist threat. Neither of you would even consider negotiating with him, and you would even accept, at that point, the election going to the house.</p><p>Over the next few days, there are calls - from Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts, and from Humphrey’s friend Dwayne Andreas. There’s a letter from Teddy White, which passes through press secretary Les Slote. There’s a grand alliance, they say, to forestall <q>a leadership outright opposed to your policies.</q> You know you can’t take this chance up, and you can’t give Wallace anything - your mind is already made up as you start wiring telegrams back.</p>`;

America, thrown into chaos, will under Wallace turn back the clock on civil rights and racial relations, back to the shadows of hatred and discrimination.</p><p>Soon come the calls - from Humphrey, Johnson - and you understand what has to be done. Whatever your power, you and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans that aren’t afraid to stand up for civil rights will fight tooth-and-nail to obstruct Wallace’s demagoguery at every turn.</p><p>You don’t know how it ever came to this - it should have been impossible, absolutely so - and you will not let Wallace forget it.

You thank and congratulate him in turn - it hurts bad to lose.</p><p>You thought yourself able to do better than Goldwater, redirecting your party, but it seems you’ll be lost in history. Perhaps it was the problems you were saddled with - stumbling responses, personality, and handicaps - or maybe it was Johnson. ‘72 will see, probably, a repudiation of your beloved Eastern Establishment in favor of the Goldwaterite politics you had struggled to fight.</p><p>Come Inauguration Day, you’re in Washington.

Immediately as the call comes through, you wire a telegram to the Humphrey campaign. You thank him for running a good campaign - he’s a good man, you say, with a good heart. Humphrey calls later in the day, when he thanks you back. Later, too, comes the call from Johnson - he’s cordial, telling you that you ran well. He invites you and Happy to spend a Camp David weekend before inauguration to watch the Super Bowl, the game between the Jets and the Colts.</p><p>Though so many things threatened to sink your campaign - your personality, your handicaps, the answers you gave and stumbled through - you have at least made it a close election, and beaten Goldwater in some small way. Nevertheless, your loss in such a winnable election does hurt, and it’s your wing of the party that suffers. Best prepare for a shift in the Republican Party come 1972.</p><p>Now, you must return to your fiefdom, planting yourself in the sage’s eyrie at Pocantico Hills, to watch over your state until someone else should guide it.</p>`;

You say ‘Hiya, fella’ - a habit that doesn’t translate well on the phone - and thank him for all he’s done. He compliments you on the hard-fought victory, and even cracks jokes. He calls you a good man, and you thank him back for being a good opponent. You can detect some somberness in his voice, though, balancing out relief - but he’s showing you all through the phone.</p><p>You’ve done all that you set out to do - re-shaping the Party in your image and guiding it past Goldwater. But the country is deeply divided. Revolts from the conservatives and strong opposition to your promises will be problems in the next four years.</p><p>Do not let the thoughts of hardship occupy you, though, Nelson - this is, for now, a triumph, and you were at the head of it.</p>`;

Strong showings - in your home region of the Northeast, in the Mid-west, and on the West Coast - have delivered you, easily, to the presidency. Here it is, the result of a well-run campaign, acknowledged by Humphrey, who wires you right after with a concession. You’ve wanted this moment for years now, and it’s always been so tantalizingly close, but ambition failed you both in 1960 and 1964.</p><p>The White House, now in your hands, is a tool to be used to further your agenda, and more and more of the Republican Party falls in line, submitting to your whims, your re-imagining of it based around the Eastern Establishment. As you’ve said to yourself - <q>Never look back. Just keep on going.</q></p>`;
