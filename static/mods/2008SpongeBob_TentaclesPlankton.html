Despite all the odds stacked against you, you have won the 2008 election and a third term for the GOP!</h3><br><br>As this campaign began, most doubted your ability to even make this competitive, despite SpongeBob's obvious flaws and Patrick's candidacy throwing a wrench into things. However, this perception didn't matter in the end, as people in the future will wonder what you were able to accomplish to turn this campaign around, because oh boy, mostly everyone had the expectation of the White House turning a bit yellow for the next four years. As it turns out, the American people bought into your message of maturity and pragmatism in big droves, and as a result, you will succeed the man you lambasted in the primaries. As for how you will unite the party on top of dealing with a Democratic Congress, that's for you to decide coming up. Your risk choosing Plankton paid off in hefty dividends in the end, as he feels relieved at finally seeing success at life for once. As for how you'll interact with him as your VP remains up in the air, although many in the party, especially Krabs, are either suspicious or downright upset that a figure with such a questionable background as Sheldon's could be a heartbeat away from assuming the Presidency. But he will have to be tolerated for now.<br><br>Since this result was still fairly close, don't be surprised to find out either of SpongeBob or Patrick's plans to mount a comeback, but regardless of them, should these upcoming midterms especially prove atrocious for the GOP, be wary of a plethora of credible Democratic challenges gnawing at the opportunity to take you down, especially as you deal with party fatigue and in all likelihood a sluggish economy. But hey, you were still able to achieve victory despite the fundamentals not being in your favor, so you can do it again, right?<br><br>"

Bikini Atoll is also famous for allegedly being the location of Bikini Bottom, where both President Tentacles and Vice President Plankton reside.”<br><br>A few days later, a package came to the Number One Observatory Circle, as after checking through clearances, Plankton had finally realized his goal of taking the Krabby Patty Formula for himself through the rouse of that “scientific project at Bikini Atoll” or whatever that malarkey was. Krabs was surely crying like a baby at this moment, Plankton could feel it. He wished he could see his archrival break down for the countless times the opposite occurred. But nevertheless, Plankton finally had the formula in his miniscule, pointy hands. Before opening the bottle, however, the Vice President decided to hold a bash in celebration as a treat for finally accomplishing his dreams.<br><br>As the party began to wind down with trails upon trails of vomit and needles sticking out in the background, Plankton finally did what he had to do and read the formula for the very first time. As the roll began to unravel, he couldn't hold his jubilance on his face. What does the formula read? A troll face with Fred Figglehorn based off it.<br><br>Plankton went on a rampage afterwards, where he would be indicted and convicted of illegal things done unto others, let's just say.
