As millions of fans, impersonators and politically active people visit his state funeral's premises even before his coffin arrived, and as millions more clear their schedules to say goodbye to the King, we at the Financial Times figured it would be a good idea to discuss his achievements, and his time in office.<br>Elvis had gained an incredible landslide victory in the 1968 elections, and won a comfortable re-election in 1972. His day-one executive orders ranged from the creation of a Bureau Of Cultural Affairs, a tax cut for the middle class and abolishing the draft for Vietnam. As his Presidency went on, his musical career had practically become a menagerie of reissues, unreleased demos and other similar releases, almost as if they were released posthumously. In 1971, President Presley passed the \"School Grants Act\", which redefined the American education system to include more emphasis on creative self-expression through curriculum standardization. Besides these landmark policies, Elvis' term was perceived as a high moment for the United States as the economy survived -- and even thrived -- as the Yom Kippur War and the wider Iran Oil Crisis occured in the Middle East, which crippled US imports. However, by 1976, when Elvis had ended his 2nd term as President, a \"Comeback Tour\" had been declared across the United States, all broadcast through cutting-edge satellite technology. Playing across a range of genres, the comeback tour revived Presley's musical career and propelled him to the status of legend, as many believed he had become a founding symbol of America itself. As his tours and albums dropped off by 1984, Elvis retired from the public in 1989, but notably had continued contact via the brand-new technology of the World Wide Web, especially through his e-mail. Elvis Presley thus was last seen tending to his Graceland mansion's garden, only two days before his death. Lisa Marie and the rest of Elvis' family have not commented yet, but many expect the address will be delivered on-line.</p></div>`)

It's time we bring our boys home, and end this war.\"<br>Nonetheless, top-level security officials and diplomats, such as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, have suggested that the United States could've permanently held back the North Vietnamese to the city of Hue.

The charges are primarily originating from concerns regarding Presley's closest campaigning advisor, Colonel Tom Parker. Tom was deported only a week before the 1968 elections took place, which plummeted Elvis' polling towards the single digits. As millions of Americans saw an existential threat in making a \"eminence grise\" of an illegal immigrant, even if from a US Ally like the Netherlands, gain genuine political power. Concerns regarding the Cold War fired up immensely since then, alongside new stringent requirements for gaining ballot access in most states as a Presidential candidate. Regardless, after Richard Nixon was elected nearly unopposed, Elvis was impeached as Governor of Tennessee and forced to live in Graceland in house arrest. After a few months, Elvis had been brought to trial. Whilst the Presley family declared this a \"Kangaroo court\", it concluded that Elvis had worked with international governments and illegal immigrants to weaken US governmental institutions in favor of personal financial gain, resulting in a charge of treason, with a sentence of life imprisonment.<br><i>More at page 8...</i></p></div>`)
