				"stance_desc_6": "Look folks, people here are finally embracing the idea of taxing the rich - and let me tell you, that's a step in the right direction. Why? Because we all know the simple truth: the wealthiest among us have hoarded an unfair share of the country's resources.",

Though the truth of his days hath long been consumed by flames and ruin, yet his name doth abide in song, tale, and holy writ - a parable of hope turned unto desolation, a prophet who spake of peace, yet did beget naught but death and perdition.</p><p>Ancient annals spake of Burnie as a man of humble birth, who among the Amerii of the North arose as a prophet. There did he gather unto himself a multitude of the poor and broken, promising them a world made anew with plenty in defiance of the greed and cruelty of the Lords of Gold and Masters of War. Many named him the Savior, sent to break the chains of man and usher in the golden morn. With tongue silvered and words as honey, he spake of a realm without hunger, without sorrow, without war. The multitude, drunken with the wine of hope, gave unto him their faith, crying <i>Not me, us!</i> as they followed him even unto to the end. Yet a few there were, seers and wise ones, who beheld him with discerning eyes and saw the hollowness of his vision, saw that his promise gleameth like gold yet holdeth naught but ash. But the world heeded naught, and Burnie ascended.</p><p>What things befell after Burnie was made chief amongst the Amerii is lost to the mists of ruin. Some affirm that he was ever false, his heart black as pitch, and that when ascended, he revealed the freedom and peace he preached was but the freedom of the grave. They say he brought the Cataclysm unto the world to free his followers from their very lives. Others hold that pride festered in his mortal heart, and Burnie, emboldened by power, made war upon the Masters of War and thereby brought ruin upon all. One heretical tale speaketh naught of Burnie's own hand, but of a shadowed temptress, Kamara the Whisperer, sorceress of the Western realms, who with voice as velvet bewitched his soul and turned his path to destruction and flame.</p><p>And thus came to pass the War in Heaven, and through it the Cataclysm, which brought fire to consume the very earth. Who his adversary was, none can say, for the records of the ancients are lost and only the memory of their sins remain. The heavens were kindled with flame, the cities fell like dry leaves, the very soil did curse his name. Yet this is certain: that they who followed Burnie perished in their thousands of thousands, and the remnant that survived wandered as wretches in the wilderness, cursing his name.</p><p>Concerning the truth of Burnie, learned scholars have ever wrangled over his nature. The True Church of ☧ doth call him a devil in the flesh, a deceiver sent by Satan himself to tempt the faithful. To them, he is the first of the False Ones, those men of sin foretold in their Book of Tribulations and Gospel of Lahae to be falsely proclaimed as lord and savior. The Ashen Order accounteth him a trickster and sorcerer, who fled the Day of Ash by assuming the form of a small gray bird, and is yet accursed to wander the earth in that shape for evermore. In ruins his likeness endureth: a bent old man, robed in gray and brown, his hands covered with gloves of heavy brown cloth. 'Tis said his touch brought only death, and thus did he hide his darkness from the eyes of men. </p><p>In tale and song, they say Burnie went from town to town in the days before his Ascension, when the Age of Gold was yet in flower, beseeching his followers again and once again for both faith and coin - until they had given him all and were left with naught. Wherefore now, mothers say to their babes, if thou seest a silver-haired elder clad in gray and brown who asketh aid, flee from him and look not back - for 'tis the wandering spirit of Burnie, who roves yet the lands, seeking new lambs to lead astray. For this cause, only few amongst the aged dare wear such colors.</p><p>Yet in these latter days hath there arisen new heresies, held by them that call themselves <i>Neo-Gnostics</i>, accursed and anathematized by the Church. They spake of the false <i>Gospel of Burnie</i>, a blasphemous reckoning wherein Burnie is not monster but martyr - yea, a prophet sore afflicted by fate, one who beheld the true doctrine of Christ and was by the Word constrained, that he might fulfill the dread prophecies of the Book of Tribulations and Gospel of Lahae, though he be accursed all his days and his name made a reproach for evermore. Another of their heretical branches spake of the blasphemous scroll <i>The Prophet's Lament</i>, wherein it is written that the prophet, upon his ascent unto power, was ensnared by demonic spirits and lost his will unto possession most foul. Thus did he behold his own mouth utter words not of his choosing, and his hands perform deeds his soul abhorred, all at the behest of a shadowed fiend that nameth itself <i>P'laiyogh</i> who ensnared him into a puppet in his own reign, a king in semblance yet a thrall in truth, even as the world did burn beneath his fettered gaze. Such teachings are abomination, yet their followers wax with the years.</p><p>For most, the name of Burnie remaineth yet a curse, a word of fear and warning. His is the lie that led the world to ruin, a specter in ash, a trickster accursed for evermore to wander the desolation of the earth which by his own hand was laid waste. In the sacred texts of the Ashen Order, it is written: <i>Beware the man who promiseth all, yet asketh naught. Beware the tongue that speaketh of plenty in a world of want. For his path leadeth not unto Paradise, but unto the end of all things.</i> And so it is that Burnie's accursed name is spoken with trembling lips, a shadow upon memory of the hubris of man.</p><p>And some, yea, even unto this day, whisper that he doth liveth yet, wandering the silent wastes beyond the Dead Cities, his cloak rent and tattered, his gloved hands outstretched yet again.<br><br>Waiting.<br><br>Asking.</p></span><br> Ending slide #1.`);

You sit, surrounded by your people - your staff, a few Cabinet members, and Jane, her hand in yours - all of them watching, all of them hoping. The early numbers look good - better than good. But Faiz shakes his head. "Don't get excited - they're absentee ballots. The blue mirage, to match the red mirage of 2020." You nod slowly, familiar with the idea - but still, you let yourself believe, just for a moment, that you might pull it off again. That the voters would carry you across the finish line, that the cynics would be proven wrong one last time.</p><p>Then the trickle begins, as county after county turns to the right - the blue mirage replaced with a late red surge. The New York Time's needle starts spinning to the right, ever slowly, ever inexorably. Your war room tries to reassure you "It's still early", they say, but your gut tightens. Not a mandate, but a coin flip - and slowly, agonizingly, it falls against you.</p><p>When the election is called for ${opponent_name}, the room goes utterly still. You wince as ${opponent_last_name} strides onto a stage awash in red white and blue, ${opponent_vp_last_name} at his side, while the crowd chants "${opponent_slogan} ${opponent_slogan}" That's it - after everything, the marches, the legislation, the rallies. All of it slipping away like a dream, not because you didn't fight, but because a country in pain turned to a lie dressed in flags and fear, turned to a movement you've fought half your life.</p><p>${opponent<=4 ? "Trump is back - this time with a sycophant partner, one who won't wince and squirm when he wants a hatchet man." : opponent==5 ? "As the preening scion of the Trump family moves to take the White House his father once enjoyed, you think of the famous quote from Marx: <i>Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: The first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Caussidière for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793 to 1795, the nephew for the uncle.</i> And today, the son for the father." : "Trump himself may not be coming back, but "+opponent_last_name+" is cut from the same cloth - only slick, telegenic and repackaged for the youth."} You think of the people who'll be hurting - the immigrants in border shelters, the pregnant women fighting for abortion rights, the diabetics hoping for cheaper insulin.

But hope has a way of digging its claws in you, especially when so many people needed something to hold onto. Your supporters - those that remained - swore the energy was still there. The polls had missed you before - remember Michigan in 2016? You told yourself the country wasn't going back after everything. But the thing about lightning in a bottle is that it only comes once.</p><p>The results come in - too fast, too brutal. State after state is called before the night even hits its stride. Not just battlegrounds, but states you had locked down four years ago. It's not a red wave - it's a tsunami, the kind that washes away dreams, movements, and futures. It's barely night, and on the New York Times website, the needle is pointing to a 99% chance of ${opponent_last_name} victory. 99% chance of your defeat.</p><p>Your stomach turns as the networks call it - early, while they're still voting on the West Coast. At least this time most of the votes have been cast, you think, unlike poor Jimmy Carter in 1980. <i>Landslide</i>, they call it - the type they reserve for seismic shifts, the type no President wants to hear. You watch on the big screen as ${opponent_name} struts onto stage like a performer, while the crowd chants "${opponent_slogan} ${opponent_slogan}" You can already hear what's coming: a government ran by billionaires and bigots, social programs gutted and sold off.

The operation, CSIS alleges, aimed to amplify pro-independence sentiment among Albertans, sow distrust in federal institutions, and destabilize Canada during a period of heightened economic and political tension.</p><p>The June 2026 referendum saw 42 percent of Albertans voting to leave Confederation, underperforming polls that showed a dead heat. Premier Danielle Smith, who actively campaigned for independence, hailed the results as a “clear sign that Ottawa must listen.” The “No” side, led by a cross-partisan coalition including former premiers Rachel Notley and Jason Kenney, as well as federal Conservative Leader and Leader of the Opposition Pierre Poilievre and former prime minister Stephen Harper, ultimately prevailed with 58 per cent of the vote.</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney called the CSIS findings “deeply troubling” and has ordered an expanded inquiry. “Canada will not tolerate foreign interference in our democratic processes,” Carney said during a press conference Monday. “We will pursue every avenue to get to the bottom of this.”</p><p>The CSIS report also reveals that David Parker, leader of the influential “Take Back Alberta” movement and a key proponent of the “Yes” campaign, travelled to Washington in late 2025 and held a previously undisclosed meeting with U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance. While the purpose of the meeting remains unclear, intelligence officials flagged the encounter as part of a broader pattern of “unusual and concerning contacts.”</p><p>The White House has denied the allegations. In a statement issued Tuesday morning, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the claims “categorically false” and accused Ottawa of using “unsubstantiated accusations to distract from internal divisions,” offering that “perhaps they would be better off as our cherished 51st state.”</p><p>The revelations come amid escalating tensions between the two countries, already embroiled in a bruising trade war marked by tariffs on energy exports, retaliatory measures on Canadian agricultural goods, and a rise in antagonism on both sides of the border.</p><p>Political analysts say the CSIS report is likely to inflame partisan divides within Alberta and complicate an already fraught relationship between Edmonton and Ottawa. Premier Smith has not commented directly on the allegations but reiterated her belief that Albertans “deserve a fair deal in Confederation.”</p><p>The opposition in Edmonton is already calling for public hearings and greater transparency. “This is a five-alarm fire for Canadian democracy,” said Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi. “Foreign interference, particularly from an allied nation, cannot be brushed aside. We need to immediately hear from Premier Smith about what she knew and when.”</p><p>The House of Commons national security committee is expected to hold emergency sessions later this week to assess the scope of the alleged interference and recommend safeguards ahead of future provincial and federal elections.</p><p>

Boos erupted. Several audience members began shouting, and one threw an unidentified bottle at the stage. Within moments, security staff attempted to escort Morrow out as a crowd of onlookers surged forward, some singing the Albanian national anthem and chanting "Kosova është Shqipëri!"

A scuffle broke out as Morrow was rushed into a nearby vehicle pursued by members of the audience.</p><p>Local media described the incident as "blatantly ignorant", while the mayor of Vushtrri threatened to terminate the sister city relationship with Norwalk if an official apology was not received.

Her panel was meant to address the fight against colonialism and imperialism. However, it was her opening remarks that gathered the most attention for reasons she likely did not intend.</p><p>"Before we begin, we must first acknowledge that we gather here today on the ancestral lands of the Gauls", Whitman declared, "a Celtic people whose lands were taken by imperial conquest - first by Rome, then by Frankish invaders, and now administered by the modern French state. This is occupied land, and we must never forget that."</p><p>The audience, comprising international delegates, responded with a moment of silence, followed by murmurs of confusion. While some American delegates offered polite applause, the rest of the audience exchanged puzzled glances. One activist from the French labor NGO ReAct Transnational was overheard asking "Does she want Paris to be returned to Astérix and Obélix?"</p><p>Attendees from France and across Europe were quick to express confusion at Whitman's remarks and framing. "It was deeply unexpected", said Élisabeth Marchand, a reporter at the French investigative newspaper Mediapart who was in attendance at the event. "While it may be technically accurate that the Gauls were here before the Franks, most of us do not consider ourselves colonizers of our own ancestors. France is a continuous cultural tapestry - not an occupation."</p><p>Others were more blunt. "It felt like she was reading from a script meant for elsewhere", said Abisai Haufiku, an activist with the Namibian Landless People's Movement attending the forum. "There are important decolonial conversations to be had about the French continuing presence in Africa, but conflating ancient history with present-day power structures is not the way to do it."</p><p>Still, a few applauded her efforts. "While clumsy, it is admirable for her to try and apply decolonial thinking globally", commented Claire Penven, a Breton activist. "Most people don't think of Celtic history as living history, but it stirred a conversation we rarely had about the erasure of minority cultures within France. Breton, the last Celtic language spoken on the European mainland, is classified by UNESCO as severely endangered, while the French government refuses to even acknowledge its existence."</p><p>In the days since, the response online has been swift. Local detractors of Ms. Whitman in Palo Alto dubbed her the "City Councilwoman for Gaul", while a popular meme on French social media superimposed her face onto a scene from the Astérix and Obélix animated series. Meanwhile, supporters rallied behind her with the #CelticJustice hashtag, which briefly trended on Bluesky, attracting attention from Irish users and fans of the Scottish football club Celtic F.C.</p><p>Whitman defended her comments on her Bluesky account, stating, "Land acknowledgment isn't just an American issue. Empire is empire - Roman or neoliberal alike. The Celts resisted Rome. We must resist imperialism today." While the DSA refused comment on the incident, a staffer speaking anonymously characterized Ms. Whitman's remarks as "a mistake" and "a distraction", saying "we probably should have workshopped it first."</p><p>Forum organizers have removed Ms. Whitman's acknowledgment from the official transcript, though the recording of her panel remains available in full online.</p><br>Ending slide #34`);

"predecessor Bernie Sanders" : "predecessors Sanders and Harris"}, despite Democratic arguments that ${opponent_last_name} inherited a strong foundation from the outgoing administration.</p><p>According to a poll by the Trafalgar Group, 62% of registered voters say that the economy is "better now" under ${opponent_last_name}, compared to only 28% who believe it was better under ${ticket_status<3 ? "President Sanders" : "Presidents Sanders and Harris"}. While economists point to strong job growth, low unemployment, and an uptick in domestic manufacturing under ${ticket_status<3 ? "the Sanders administration" : "the Sanders-Harris administrations"}, public sentiment appears to have been strongly shaped by the high inflation of 2022. "All I remember of Bernie is my rent doubling and grocery prices going through the roof", said Rhonda Martinez, a nurse in New York City. "Now, at least things feel stable."</p><p> Democrats have pushed back, pointing out that inflation was tamed by the end of ${ticket_status<3 ? "the Sanders administration" : "the Sanders-Harris administrations"}, that ${opponent_last_name} was handed a low unemployment rate and inflation rate and is reaping the benefits of Sanders' industrial policy and economic stewardship. "President Sanders created one of the strongest middle-class economies in recent history", said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA). "${opponent_name} is just cutting the ribbon on factories whose groundwork was laid under Bernie." But the message appears to be falling flat with voters. "Fair or not, people associated Sanders with inflation and economic anxiety", political commentator Frank Luntz opined. "President ${opponent_last_name} is reaping the political reward of good timing."</p><br>	Ending Slide #35`)
