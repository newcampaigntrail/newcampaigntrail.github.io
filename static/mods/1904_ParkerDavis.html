It is much to the dismay of the conservative wing of the Democrats that you have conducted a campaign so ineffectual that it produced the least competitive result since James Monroe’s second election -- the difference being that Monroe didn’t even have a competitor. The progressive wing has been emboldened, and are certain to seize control of the party at its next Convention in 1908.</p><p>Roosevelt will continue his unconstitutional policies of imperialism and overreach for at least another four years, and the scale of his victory may convince him yet to run for four more after. As for you, your career in politics is most certainly over. You have won for yourself the most ignominious label possible: the most brutal and crushing defeat in American history. Your name will go down as a footnote in textbooks to mark you with the only label fit for a man who fumbled the ball so much as yourself: <i>loser</i>.</p>"
