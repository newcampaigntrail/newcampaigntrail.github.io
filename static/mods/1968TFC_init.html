Although he is a relative newcomer to politics, his reach throughout the Republican Party cannot be ignored. After beating Nelson Rockefeller in the primaries, Reagan must unify his party and the nation, while wrestling attacks regarding his ideology and inexperience.</p><p>Hubert Humphrey is the incumbent Vice President of the United States, serving under President Lyndon Johnson. Humphrey must keep his “Happy Warrior” moniker alive by keeping liberals and moderates on his side. While he enjoys a small lead over Reagan, all isn’t well.
