As you talk you get a call from Wallace, as you pick up the phone you can hear under all the niceties a broken man who has lost faith in the country and himself. You also receive a call from Stassen which is much more quick. As you sit back and the true ramifications of this event set in, you can’t explain the emotions you are feeling, both a feeling of glory and dread.\n\n<br><br> You inherit a Democratic congress, the public truly fed up with Republican obstructionism. You now have the chance to fix many of the foreign policy disasters undergone by Wallace and reaffirm American strength to all our foes and allies. Economically plans are already being drawn up for a new round of New Deal legislation, with a more conservative tone than those proposed by Wallace, and you can finally secure the legacy of FDR, and perhaps even make a legacy of your own. You must also carefully deal with the China crisis which could threaten to consume your administration. Across the south celebrations break out for one of their own has reclaimed the White House, but for the millions of minorities and blacks across the nation, they fear for what a truly Southern administration will look like.\n\n\n\n",

Although you have lost the presidency the Democrats have managed to retake Congress with the people fed up with Republican congressional obstructionism.\n\n<br><br> The loss of Congress and his largely northern electorate will likely lead to Stassen running the nation in a more liberal fashion than most Republicans. The loss has thrown the party into chaos with blame being thrown at every possible faction. Progressives pounce at the opportunity to paint this as proof the Southern faction of the party is unelectable while the Southerners blame the progressives' disloyalty for the loss. This whole debacle paints a bleak future for the party with the 1952 convention likely going to be disastrous. For you, however, it is likely that this is the end for any possible presidential ambitions, however, Georgia is more than willing to welcome you back as a senator with open arms and you will remain a major figure in the Democratic Party.\n\n<p>STASSEN TAKES WHITE HOUSE, DEMS COLLAPSE.</p>",
