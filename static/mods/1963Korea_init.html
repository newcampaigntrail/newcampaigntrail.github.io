Thank you for playing another mod made by FlongydOlson.</p><p><span style=\\\"width:700px;text-align:left;display:inline-block;line-height:1.33em;\\\">Since Park Chung-hee came to power, the May 16 Military Coup has long been celebrated by the Korean people, calling it a 'military revolution'. Even during the Roh Tae-woo administration after democratization, it was called a revolution, but only after President Kim Young-sam took office in 1993, it was revalued and started to be called a coup. However, still, not a few conservative politicians consider it a revolution.</span></p><p><a href=\\\"https://gwangjunewsgic.com/features/jeolla-history/the-may-16-military-coup-how-it-came-about/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Gwangju News, 2003, The May 16 Military Coup: How It Came About</a></p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/117_65949.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The Korea Times, 2010, Gen.

There is also speculation that Yun Po-sun's ideological offensive during the election became a trauma to Park, ironically causing him to implement a very strong anti-communist policy later.</span><br><br></p><p><span style=\\\"width:700px;text-align:left;display:inline-block;line-height:1.33em;\\\">This election was very important in Korean history, but it has little data and relatively low interest.
