These are the Nativist-Populist Know Nothings, and the anti-Slavery Expansion Republicans.</p><p>President Pierce has been ousted at the Democratic Convention, to former Senator, Diplomat and 3 time almost-Presidential nominee James Buchanan. The Know Nothings have nominated Former President Millard Fillmore, the most prominent champion for their cause. The Republicans have nominated explorer and early California statesman John C. Frémont for their first campaign.
