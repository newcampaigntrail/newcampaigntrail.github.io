He's been here before - negotiating with President Bush, meeting with him after being elected. But never... like this. He was basically alone - his running mate, his advisors, his family, were all in other parts of this big and powerful building. Besides the Secret Service looking around, Harris was by himself. Sometimes it's good to be alone - the campaign to achieve this office was a lot. He lost his wife during the primaries, had many restless nights, all while the stakes were higher than ever before. Wofford decided then to sit down at the desk - the Resolute Desk. They moved it back for him.<br>As Harris sits down, he thinks for a moment. It's Martin Luther King Day. Huh. Then, he noticed a piece of paper right in front of him. Upon opening it, he began to read -<br><br><i>Dear Harris,<br>By the time you read this, you will be our President. Eight years ago, I too stepped into that ofice with the same feeling of wonder and awe that you must be feeling now.<br>Of course, the conditions we took office under will be different. You will be under a lot of scrutiny, some of which won't be fair. I can't always offer advice, but don't let pundits or critics discourage you from doing the right thing.<br>I am counting on you to succeed. America is counting on you. We are rooting for you, and we know you will succeed<br>Good luck -<br>George</i><br><br>Harris thinks for a moment, puts the letter away, and begins buzzing staff in to begin the work of the President of the United States.</FONT></p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 1 - PRESIDENT WOFFORD vs FAMILY GUY (and the other animated comedies) Chapter IV</h3><p>In the early '90s, we saw President George Bush go toe to toe with the Simspons. He even made an enemy out of Bart. Many thought this type of pretty politics on behalf of the President of the United States was purely related to Bush as a moralistic personality - it turns out that these politicians are just sensitive.<br>After that particularly embarrassing incident, I never really thought that we could see something to that degree again. There wouldn't be a show with as much cultural influence as The Simpsons, and there wouldn't be a leader as soft as Bush. I was wrong. I remember February 14th, 2002, more vividly than any celebrity death, terrorist attack, birthday, or otherwise, not because of some major tragedy but because that was the day President Harris Wofford lashed out at Family Guy. Before I say anything else, let me just set the stage for you here.<br><br>Family Guy was going strong in 2001/2002/2003 - some people call it the golden era of the show - I think that right now we're doing pretty well, but it's a difference of opinion. We were nearly at Simpsons level, Stewie wasn't Bart, but everyone loved him. And Peter - a lovable, relatable American dad. And of course, Brian, who I had made sure was a strong Wofford supporter.<br>We were a satire. We cracked jokes at the expense of the President many times - and of course, at the Republicans as well. But some people didn't seem to like it. I remember Senator Strom Thurmond supposedly gave a jumbled rant about a joke we had made in 2000, although that was a rumor.  We wouldn't expect President Wofford to be Thurmond-sensitive though. So, here's the joke;<br><br>Brian: ''This is just like the time I caught Harris Wofford in a porta potty.''<br>(Then of course we went to a cutaway of Brian standing in front of a portapotty.)<br>Brian: 'President Wofford, the Soviets just shot down the UN resolution condemning Iraqi aggression against Israel!'<br>(And then this really deep voice speaks)<br>''He's busy.''<br>(And then of course Wofford speaks.)<br>Kinda Gay Wofford Voice: ''Yeah, I'm busy!''<br>--<br>I mean it was a gay joke, we made a lot of those! I wasn't expecting him to rant about us in a press conference!<br> - <i>Seth MacFarlane</i></FONT></p>"];

In fact, in a recent Fox News interview, McCain seemed to claim that the assassination was further proof of his interventionist agenda.<br><br>''With all due respect, President Wofford was targeted because of what he allowed to happen internationally over the last eight years. We allowed many of our worst enemies to take power in Russia and the other states, and it created a fog of anger and resentment towards American leadership.'' The president told Bill O'Reilly. <br><br>''Are you saying he deserved it?''<br><br>''No, no, that's not what I said. What I meant was that his foreign policy choices completely divorced America from the outside world. It allowed many truly evil people to take power in Russia and only served to strengthen men like Saddam Hussein. The reason our administration looks so - rough on these bombings is because we're doing nine years' worth of bombings in one run.''<br><br>President McCain's newfound crusade against what he calls ''communistic-fascists'' within Russia has attracted a large amount of scrutiny from pundits and voters alike, especially after the bombings conducted in paramilitary-held territory in abandoned Kyiv. These strikes are also on top of his recent operations against targets in Iran and Iraq.<br><br>So far, the death toll racked up by the McCain administration is unknown. His panache for bombings doesn't leave an easy body count, and we have reason to believe there are military operations we, the general public, don't even know about.<br><br>So far, tens of thousands of people are known to have died, as well as a Polish cow who had been blown up after an American missile landed on the wrong side of the border.<br><br>Not since Lyndon Johnson have we had a president so willing to illuminate the night sky with explosions, and we can only hope he falls to old LBJ's fate in 2008.</FONT></p>"];

To say it had been an unmitigated disaster would be an understatement. Maybe we need to look back to December of '99. Lieberman hadn't been particularly good at keeping his frustrations with the Wofford administration and 2000 ambitions a secret. There was also the launch issue. Joe was under the assumption that if he wanted to beat Wofford, he had to mark himself as a change candidate. At the time, we tried to warn him that Joe Lieberman doesn't work as a change candidate.<br><br>What's more futuristic than AOL? Well, he [Joe] tried to get on MTV, but for some reason, they didn't think he fit on the program. In the end, he launched his campaign on the internet, with AOL, and it took hours for anybody to realize this wasn't some sort of sick joke. No, no, the bomb Russia guy was trying to appeal to the kids.<br><br>I personally wasn't shocked when the first polls showed Senator Lieberman at around 5% against Wofford's 82%, although I could tell he was furious.<br><br>So, after that, we head to Iowa. I said that we should probably just head straight to New Hampshire but he was hell-bent on getting a strong second in Iowa. This is where he rolled out the, perhaps infamous, Joemobile. It wasn't my idea, and I don't think it helped people take Joe seriously as a candidate, but at least Senator Lieberman was having fun.<br><br>I remember he was in this Iowa City high school and some kid asked Joe if he was going to send him to war. For the record, that is a completely unfair question. Lieberman looked at the kid dead on and said ''Yes. We need to have an active presence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.'' I had to roll my eyes.<br><br>After I told him that promising to ship them to their deaths wasn't a winning message for the youths of America he decided to pivot to older Democrats.<br><br>Well, a lot of them didn't know he was even running. Even worse, the moment he said he was from Connecticut they let out a grimace, before making a remark about how Wofford was from the Midwest.

However, he's also extremely aggressive whenever a single Senate Republican tries to touch his precious domestic liberalism. The moment members of his party attempt to disagree with him, like former Democratic Senator from Connecticut Joe Lieberman - they're cast out from the party.<br><br>Many members of his administration remind me of other Shrek characters as well. James Carville? That's Donkey. Robert Reich? That's the Gingerbread man. And you can't forget about Lord Farquaad himself, Gary Hart. The Wofford administration is a comedy sketch show, and the American people are paying the price.<br><br>The point is, we need a real leader in '04. Now, I'm out of the politics game myself but there are plenty of real patriots who can bring the United States back out onto the world stage. There are rumors that Joe Lieberman may run for the Republican nomination in 2004 and completely abandon the Democrat isolationism. He's a bit willy-nilly on the abortion stuff, but he's a good man.

World politics is slowly struggling to enter a new phase, a phase suppressed by the longtime ideological struggles of the Cold War. Today, world conflicts will not be caused by ideological clanging, or economic concerns. Modern conflicts are east-western, battles between different civilizations with completely different cultural roots. President Wofford’s efforts in Kosovo are more than an attempt to stop an ethnic genocide-he is stepping into a clash between the Orthodox Civilization and the Islamic one. The Cold War only briefly interrupted this long-standing paradigm of civilizational clash-and it is notable that in conflict zones where true idealogues are still in power, such as the former Soviet Union, conflicts are still largely ideological. In the post-communist void of Yugoslavia there is no such suppressant of civilizational tensions…<br><br>President Wofford has announced that the US is completely committed to the capture of Slobodan Milošević.

Later on, it was determined that Williams had lied about his presence on the helicopter-he apologized, stating he misremembered and that he was in the chopper behind it. His problems were only compounded once the pilot who flew Williams’ helicopter said the one that was shot down was in an entirely different platoon. Williams has apologized to the American Veterans of Kosovo Association, and the American Legion.<br><br>Some, however, have criticized Williams’ firing. Celebrity Psychologist Britney Spears states, “Williams’ misstatements are consistent with those who have suffered extreme combat trauma in combat situations. Memory is a malleable thing-and I’ve had plenty of clients who served in conflicts such as Kosovo or Syria who have struggled with exactly what quite happened to them. This circus isn’t based on good science-even when he misremembered a second time, it’s better to just say oops, he did it again, than to pillory him for misremembering something as traumatic as a warzone.”<br><br>Williams will return after six months to his old position, but some have posited that Williams may choose to retire-ratings have already plummeted for his show, even after his on-air apology.

While Gary Hart talks about the economy and Iowa caucus winner Tom Harkin stumps throughout rural counties, Kucinich is raving about video games in an old diner.<br><br>''We're really dropping the ball here.'' The Congressman said to an older gentleman. ''I mean, Sega has the entire market - the whole thing - and Sony's also there. Where's America? Where's Microsoft? Why are we letting these Asian companies completely run our market? It's not right!'' he raved to the group, many of whom later said they had never played a video game.<br><br>''Look, have you seen this game?'' Kucinich said, waving a copy of Crazy Taxi 3, a Sega Spartan game where the player takes control of a Taxi driver in various locations and drives passengers to their destination. ''This game is really the proof - that - you know - the Japanese are trying to teach our kids to drive recklessly, and to become low-paid taxi-driving bums when they're older!'' He remarked in frustration. <br><br>Perhaps these semi-incoherent semi-political rants were destined after President Wofford's 1996 win. After all, they were seen in 1998, and many people thought that the backlash to Steve Forbes' victory in the 2000 Republican primary was the penultimate response to free trade politics in the United States, others say that the Kucinich campaign represents the nasty remains of that campaign. One month ago, during the fourth Democratic debate in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Ohio Congressman lambasted Senator's Tom Harkin and Joe Lieberman over their trade policy, infamously calling them ''In the pocket of China, Japan, and Korea.'' While it's video games now, in Iowa it was washing machines. <br><br>''I mean really - all of these machines - they're made in Korea. Let the Koreans have the Korean machines and we can make some in America! I love Korea but why are we doing this?'' Kucinich told a farmer who had asked about agriculture policy.<br><br>In Iowa, his campaign placed a disappointing 5th place - behind Harkin, Kerry, Biden, Brown, and Bayh. He only received 4.5% of the vote.<br><br>After that, it was video games.<br><br>''All of our teen boys play video games, and that's why we need them to be playing American video games! I saw a nice poll from CNN that said 60% of young Americans think that hedgehogs are naturally blue - it's horrible. I think that we can get Microsoft to change that - they need to.''<br><br>In New Hampshire - where Kucinich brags about a strong ground campaign - he is polling at 3rd, almost fourth.<br><br>Once a viable threat to the Harkin machine, many say that Dennis Kucinich has killed his political career talking about mind rotting subjects and that his presidential campaign is due to be put down by New Hampshire voters. Of course, the Congressman's strongest defenders claim he's simply ahead of his time.<br><br>Related Stories<br><br><ul><li>How Dennis Kucinich won the New Hampshire primary - and the presidency - December 2004</li><li>His revolution; Microsoft outsells Sega for the first time in American market - Sega of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé says no worry - March 2007</li><li>His Effect; How President Kucinich made Todd Howard run for office - November 2016</li></ul></FONT></p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 6 - <b><i>TECHNOLOGY; Sega Is Giving New Product Special Push To End 'Console War'</i></b></h3><p><br>By Sharon R. King<br>October 13, 1998<br><br>The verdict is out on Sega Enterprises' new video game home console. The Dreamcast, which was released in the United States only three weeks after its Japanese release, is a smash hit. The new console, which Sega claims will launch video games into the 21st century, released with over 30 brand new games, ranging from a sequel to the hit Sega Saturn release 'Sonic X-treme' to 'Streets of Rage 4', as well as multiple new brands.<br><br>However, it's not all about the fans and hit games to Sega. It's about finishing off their prime rival, Nintendo. Both Japanese manufacturers have been fighting over the video game market since the late '80s when vivid advertising clashes between Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog were commonplace. While for many years it looked like Nintendo may have had the edge with consumers, a long string of failures beginning with the innovative Virtual Boy, and then solidified by the failed Ultra 64, decried by critics as ''weak'' and ''boring'' has sent the company's reputation state-side into a tailspin.<br><br>Sega insiders reportedly hope that the success of the Dreamcast will force Nintendo out of the Western market, as they're closed in by Sega's long-lasting influence and the up-and-coming video game console, Sony's PlayStation.<br><br>Nintendo is reportedly having none of that. <br><br>Insiders suggest that the next Nintendo product will be something ''fundamentally unheard of'' and enough to ''completely flip the market on its head.'' Many, of course, scoff at the idea of a comeback, pointing at the impressive sales of the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast, as well as the incredibly disappointing Ultra 64 sales in the last quarterly report.<br><br>In a more political sense, many American politicians are praying that Sega, and Sony by extension, see the same fate as Nintendo in the American market.<br><br>It was reported only last month that former California Governor Jerry Brown was lobbying Microsoft to create an American video game console, even offering to join the company and take responsibility for the project. He was rejected by higher-ups. Elsewhere, Ross Perot is supposedly attempting to join the market with his own ''GamePerot'', although it has been met with skepticism among industry insiders.<br><br>The finish line for the so-called ''console wars'' is in sight, and right now Sonic the Hedgehog looks to be the one to beat for supremacy.</FONT></p>"];

Yesterday's episode of <i>Clone High</i> was really freaking solid! As we all know, the decision to include President Harris Wofford as a clone was an odd choice I initially disagreed with. I thought it was weird that he his counterpart was still alive - something exclusive to his clone. However, after yesterday's episode, I have fallen in love with the character. At first, I thought the joke was just the fact that Harris followed JFK around because in the real world, Wofford's administration has been way less popular compared to the legacy of Kennedy. I don't really get into politics, but I felt it was a little weird to make Wofford a punching bad. But this isn't the case.<br><br>The episode starts out with Harris following around JFK, helping him do his homework, skip class, etc etc. Eventually, JFK asks Harris if he has anything better to do and then asks him to give him some time alone. Harris eventually sulks his way to Abe and Gandhi, who tell Harris to cheer up. Harris eventually returns home, and begins watching television for the first time, and learns that his historical counterpart is not only still alive, but the President of the United States. The three of them decide to head off to Washington to meet President Wofford, and JFK soon embarks to find Harris because he realizes he misses him.<br><br>Eventually they make it to Washington, but Secret Service mistakes the younger Wofford for a wanted criminal, and attempt to apprehend him. President Wofford then recognizes Harris, and hijinks ensue. Eventually, Harris realizes his potential is just as much as JFK, and returns to Exclamation, USA, with better esteem.<br>This episode really built Harris as a real character, and not just a one-off punching bag for real world situations. If you have cable, I would recommend watching this. Tune in next time as I argue why Nintendo will keep making handheld consoles even as they exit the home console market!</FONT></p>"];

The reason the morale of New York City is so low is because of one reason and one reason alone: Rudy Giuliani!” he shouted yesterday at an Election Eve Rally in Brooklyn. The people of New York City agree-in a serious turnaround from early polling, we can now project that the Reverend Al Sharpton is the new Mayor of New York City. In a campaign somehow even uglier than that of 1993, where Giuliani swept aside Mayor Dinkins, the first black mayor of New York City, in what was often considered to be a highly racialized race, Al Sharpton has somehow repudiated his predecessor’s failures and become Gotham’s next mayor.<br><br>Pummeling Giuliani’s acceptance of urban budget cuts, and his close ties to President Wilson, whose announcement of another round in HUD cuts shortly before the election to pay for further supplies for fighters in Ukraine, Sharpton waged an aggressive campaign, attacking the Mayor on everything from crime to spending to garbage disposal cycles. He also received support from national Democrats-Harris Wofford, the failed contender in 1996, arrived shortly before the election speaking for the Reverend. Giuliani, in contrast, focused on his mayoral record, and his tough-on-crime reputation.<br><br>The real dam seemed to break, however, when he released an ad nicknamed, ''The Big Ukrainian Apple,” which described a future Sharpton mayoralty as an open warzone similar to the current conflict in Ukraine. The ad was criticized for its racial undertones, and Giuliani’s scattershot response, where he accused the Sharpton campaign of playing the ad in secret and then was publicly caught having paid for it, corresponded with a sinking in the polling numbers.<br><br>So far it appears Sharpton has won 54% of the vote compared to Giuliani’s 44.5%, but that margin could change. Giuliani is already alleging voter fraud in multiple Bronx precincts and across Brooklyn, charges that Sharpton has already forcefully dismissed and is arguing are ''racially motivated, as is everything by the Giuliani mayoralty.” Sharpton, as mayor, plans to stop city austerity policies, and, ''create a national platform opposing Wilson’s failed domestic policies.”</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 11 - <i>DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SEE PAUL WELLSTONE 2000? - r/thecampaigntrail - posted by u/Think_Climate_6544</i></h3><p><br>What if Paul Wellstone didn't lose re-election in 1996 and ran for president in 2000, and what happens next and who are the presidents?

After all, nothing comes close to the insanity that was Jerry Brown's primary run, right? Well. I had to remind her of what we saw in 2000.<br><br>1998 had been a very underwhelming year for the Democratic Party, normally with these kinds of midterms the outside party (which we were all painfully reminded had been the Democrats since 1981) managed to make huge gains in Congress and the individual states. Well, Wofford's loss in 1996 had scared Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle so hard that they refused to run an aggressive campaign against the Wilson administration. We hardly made any gains - it's what scared me off of running for office in 2000.<br><br>By '99 the entire party was having this weird seizure, a large-scale panic attack as they realized the weight of what a failure in 2000 may mean. Six terms out of power. From what I've heard, Jimmy Carter was calling anyone and everyone within the DNC telling them to get their stuff together. Maybe he thought it would reflect even worse on him if they lost again. By halfway through the year, we had this insane field of candidates. Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman, Warren Beatty, Jerry Brown, and Skip Humphrey - anybody in the world who could run was running.<br><br>It was hellish.<br><br>Bill Clinton, who had been in a nasty divorce recently, found himself the punching bag of the primary. From SNL to the average voter, it seemed like a lot of the old moral problems that brought him down in 1992 never went away. On top of that, he was a loser to the party establishment. It was the same reason they chased away McGovern when he publicly stated he was thinking about running in 1998, or hid Dukakis away at the '92 DNC. The DNC hates losers, and Bill Clinton isn't changing that.<br><br>By Iowa, nobody knew who the frontrunner was. Polls said that it was Mario Cuomo, who wasn't even in the race. That's how completely estranged the field was. They were covered by a thin smoke in the polling as people who weren't running still managed to outrun them. More conventional wisdom said that Biden or Lieberman were the frontrunners, mostly because they were the most well-known politicians in the field.<br><br>Warren Beatty was the wildcard, and only one other Democratic candidate knew to be wary of him.<br><br>''He had Pat.'' Joe Biden told me during an interview in 2001. ''Pat Caddell - greatest man I ever knew. I was sad, you know, he had been my friend since the start - since I got into the Senate. I was more scared than anything though. He [Beatty] was just as serious as I was, or anyone else running for that matter.''<br><br>Caddell launched an operation in Iowa that played to Beatty's best capability; being an outsider. The general idea was that politicians had lost 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1996. They had done everything except nominate an outsider. And so Warren Beatty won 28.3% of the vote in Iowa, with second going to Biden at 24.7%. The Cuomo fog slowly faded revealing Warren Beatty's newfound base.<br><br>Biden, it was something else.<br><br>''It was me vs Pat.''' He gave me a sad chuckle. ''I hated going against him. I hated how we left off back in '88. It felt wrong. And you know, I was off my element - and we lost the primary.'' I could feel his internal conflict.<br><br>''In the end, it was a bit ironic you know.'' Biden stood up, reaching down to shake my hand.

We're going to be a nation run by famous losers who only care about themselves. I'm not going to be a part of that.'' He then made an announcement that shocked many of his fans.<br><br>''I'll tell you right now, Tucker - I promise you I'm never going to run for political office. I have a lot of good ideas but now they'll all be wasted because for some reason Ted Nugent thinks he's qualified to be president. He's not.''<br><br>''So what are you going to do?'' Tucker asked.<br><br>''Well, Warren Beatty stole my job so now I'll steal his. You know, I was very good in Home Alone.'' He smirked. ''I plan on making movies, big amazing movies.'' He made a motion with his hands. ''Trump Studios, it'll be making action films, not these cheap movies, I mean the big ones that we used to make. They don't make those anymore, so I'm going to.''<br><br>Asked if he would ever rethink his political abstinence, Trump showed rare self-reflection.<br><br>''You know, after all of these frankly insane Hollywood freaks take office and ruin the idea,'' He started.

A longtime World Bank Official, Summer has been advising Democrats on economic issues for years, starting with the Dukakis campaign in 1988, loyally serving the Clinton Campaign in 92, and advising the failed Richards campaign in 1996. Failed Presidential Contender Harris Wofford, it is reported, allegedly harshly repudiated Summers’ help in the 96 campaign, but in the supposed words of Summers himself, “look how far that got him.”<br><br>A controversial figure, Summers is well out of Democratic economic orthodoxy-he publicly praised the repeal of Glass-Steagall, publicly advised multiple nations from South Korea to Mexico to engage in austerity measures, and got in hot water in ‘91 for “jokingly,” in his words, suggesting that it would be economically advisable to pollute poorer countries more.

Hewes is a longtime New York candidate, running for senate in 1994 in his home state against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Previously, Hewes had served as a consultant and a political director for the Buchanan campaign in 1992 and for President Bush’s successful re-election campaign, but has switched to the Democratic Party due to his discontent with their last candidate for President, Pete Wilson. Running on a pro-life platform, Hewes has begun to stump across New Hampshire, expressing that some Democrats want to avoid foreign involvement and stand for the pro-life movement.<br><br>Hewes’ run underscores the fears many Democrats have-that President Wofford is not able to successfully mobilize his coalition behind him. Wofford may still have a steady approval rating, and early polls of New Hampshire and Iowa suggest his vote share will crack 95%, but many Democrats fear that many traditional Democratic voting groups, such as the pro-life, fiscal conservatives, and the wealthy, may be displeased with the Wofford administration.

However, the final straw was Wofford telling the cabinet that he supports, in principle, the PATRIOT Act being considered by House Republicans following the August 3rd terrorist attack that the Intelligence Agency claims that Libya was behind.<br><br>It is currently unknown who Wofford plans to nominate for Vice President. Democrat's narrow margin in the Senate, a 51-49 majority, likely means that Wofford may be forced to select someone more to the center rather than the unabashed liberal that Feingold is. Some southern Democrats, most notably John Breaux of Louisiana and Chuck Robb of Virginia, are privately lobbying Wofford to select former Georgian Governor Zell Miller. Whether the selected Vice President is to be renominated for a full term come the 2000 Democratic Convention may also be a factor Wofford will have to consider.</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 36 - Dextero: Leaks show id Software worked on DOOM-like game based on Russian Civil War in the 1990s</h3><p>In perhaps one of the strangest bits of information found in legal documents during the Microsoft's acquistion of ZeniMax Media, it was revealed that id Software, the creators of the DOOM franchise had been working on a first person shooter based on the instability of Russia during the 1990s, with the game using the original DOOM engine. The game would see the player take control of a freedom fighter inside of a ''large, fictional country'' at midst of quelling a massive rebellion.<br><br>While the game was not meant to explicitly establish itself itself in Russia, the idea of a ''super-soldier rebel blasting through and kicking ass across a seemingly unstoppable nation'' was inspired by the Russian Opposition Forces' success following the Soviet Offensive of October 1996. Development on the game began before the end of 1996, with a planned release date by 1999. However, the underperformance of <i>Quake</i> caused long-term budgetary issues, forcing id Software to shift development towards their existing franchises.</p>"];

Wofford's own missteps in failing to heal a divided party further exasperated Democratic campaign leaders. Despite this, the resulting campaign proved to some that Pete Wilson - who ultimately prevailed - was much weaker than many had expected.<br><br>With a stumbling approval rating for Wilson, many Democratic lawmakers are considering throwing their hat into the ring. Our hypothetical polling, done by contacting Democratic voters, shows a wide varieties in options for the party. Interestingly, 68% of voters said they'd prefer someone who would beat Wilson, compared to 30% who said they'd prefer someone with the same beliefs as them.</p><b><ul><li>ANN RICHARDS (GOVERNOR OF TEXAS) - 20%</li><li>PAUL WELLSTONE (SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA) - 19%</li><li>BARBARA BOXER (SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA) - 16%</li><li>TED TURNER (BUSINESSMAN) - 12%</li><li>JAMES GRIFFIN (FORMER MAYOR OF BUFFALO - 11%</li><li>OTHER/UNDECIDED - 22%</li></ul></b><br>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 37 - SOUTH PARK makes hilarious rip into Pete Wilson! - ProudLiberalBlog.com</h3><p>Today, the controversial yet beloved Comedy Central show SOUTH PARK introduced its version of our so-called 'President'. Rather than be the side of a normal adult, Pete Wilson is now 'Little Bo Pete', with the same duties as a President of the United States, though with the lack of awareness, naiveness, and immaturity of a Fourth Grader.<br><br>In today's airing of the show, Little Bo Pete begins attening classes at South Park Elementary after getting expelled from 'all the other schools in America'. While Stan and Kyle are quick to see through the lies of this petulant presidential pretender, Eric Cartman, being the fat bastard he is, takes a liking to Pete, especially how he poorly treats all sorts of minority groups in the school.<br><br>I don't want to spoil too much, but if you like this premise, it seems Mr. Wilson may return soon. The 2000 election is coming up, and I'm sure they'll want to rip into the cynical nature of the two options (Frontrunner Tom Daschle isn't really an exciting choice, even if we have to vote for him), and they hinted at further appearances.

During all of these periods, the central Russian government exerted plenty of control over the region - but no matter what methods they took, they never could seem to completely quell the national identity of Ukraine. But the situation Ukraine faces in the 1990s is the ultimate test of survival. Soviet Russia is a husk of its former glory, yet remains vengeful. The politburo of bolshevik hardliners that now run the USSR seek to reassert control over its territory. They will do so by increasingly horrific and barbaric means - including attacks on civilian centers.<br><br>As of now, the President of the United States has refused to support official American recognition of Ukrainian independence. Our country does not recognize the nation as a sovereign and independent country. You cannot travel to America under a Ukrainian passport. To the eyes of the United States Government, 'Ukraine' does not exist. Rather, a region known as the 'Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic' exists inside of the USSR. This is not a civil war, however.
