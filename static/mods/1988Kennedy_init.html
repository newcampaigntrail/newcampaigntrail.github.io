After defeating a weak challenge from Jesse Jackson in the Democratic primaries, Kennedy faced George Bush in the general election. Kennedy initially led Bush by significant margins in early polling, aided by positive name recognition and the Reagan administration's scandals. However, after Bush attacked Kennedy with a vicious ad campaign questioning Kennedy's role in the Chappaquiddick incident, Kennedy's polling plummeted and the race became competitive from then until election day. However, Kennedy fought back by drawing attention to Bush's links to Iran Contra, and a strong debate performance put Kennedy over the top with a squeaker Electoral College victory, 272-266.<br></p><p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/TedKennedy%28D-MA%29.jpg/250px-TedKennedy%28D-MA%29.jpg\" width=\"120px\"></p>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1988,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1988Kennedy"}];e.credits = "jackreacher2975";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":24,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":153,"fields":{"first_name":"Ted ","last_name":"Kennedy","election":15,"party":"Democrat","state":"Massachusetts","priority":1,"description":"<p>Ted Kennedy needs no introduction to the American people.

You have won the 1988 election.</h3><p>Congratulations! Despite weathering a fusillade of Republican attacks, you have triumphed over Bush and Atwater's machine and set the stage for a new era of liberal dominance in Beltway politics. The House and Senate have both stayed blue as well, giving you a real mandate to attempt to enact progressive policies such as universal healthcare. Your leadership role within the party will likely allow you to set the agenda without much resistance from conservative Democrats, at least until the midterms. On the other hand, the size of your victory will likely determine the extent to which Republicans try to obstruct your platform, but Bob Dole has already pledged to work constructively with your administration. If you can deliver on your promises and keep the economy you've inherited from Reagan ticking over smoothly, you should be able to win re-election in '92.<p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Sorry, you have lost the 1988 election.</h3><p>Despite your early lead in the polls, it seems like the Republican attack machine was simply too much for you to handle. Even so, your unexpected loss comes as a surprise to most observers, and a bitter disappointment to the Democratic establishment and your supporters, who had desperately been hoping that 1988 would be the moment to finally turn things around. Already, your party is wondering if a younger, fresher candidate could have pulled through. However, the Democrats have at least kept control of Congress, and you still have your constituents in Massachusetts to deal with. Time to get back to work, Senator.<p>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>No candidate has won a majority in the Electoral College.</h3><p>In a shocking outcome, neither you nor Bush have succeeded in winning a majority through the Electoral College, effectively deadlocking the election. Fortunately for you, Democrats have kept control of the House and Senate, meaning that any vote in either chamber to decide the victor would result in Congress declaring you the winner.
