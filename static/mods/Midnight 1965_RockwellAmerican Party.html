Rockwell, who had only been in office for four and a half months, unequivocally denied the allegations.</p><p>The investigation, launched by the F.B.I. and later handed to the Department of Justice, lasted a year and a half as voter rolls were reviewed, votes cast were compared to county censuses, and the handling of the ballots was carefully combed over. Finally, last December, several poll workers from across the state testified to being bribed or threatened by T.A.P. members who would then swap out valid ballots for their own doctored ones.</p><p>A warrant went out for Rockwell’s arrest soon after these testimonies were made, but he had fled the state by the time the F.B.I. conducted their raid on the Governor’s Mansion in Richmond. Currently, Edgar Blackburn Moore, former speaker of the Virginia House of Representatives, is acting Governor and is expected to be sworn in formally later this week once the articles of impeachment against Rockwell are formally passed through both chambers of the Virginia government. This follows the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Reid Putney, who resigned the day of the F.B.I. raid. While he has not been charged, Putney is currently under investigation, as the D.O.J. attempts to determine who in the administration was aware of the fraud, and who was simply an unwitting bi-product of it.</p><p>Rockwell had been on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list for several weeks at the time of his capture, with multiple witnesses reporting sightings of him across the South. The F.B.I., D.O.J., and the media had been tracking his whereabouts as he headed East, until his last known appearance just outside New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>Rockwell was arrested earlier this morning in Plaquemines Parish, on the property of District Attorney Leander Perez. Perez was also brought in for questioning, and reportedly was found out behind his home holding a shovel, burying various T.A.P. official documents along with some of what are believed to be the swapped gubernatorial ballots. He has staunchly defended his innocence, and gave a brief statement to the press earlier this morning stating the following: “I didn’t know what [the documents] were for. Rockwell waltzed in saying ‘Leander, get a shovel’, and I acquiesced. That doesn’t make me a criminal. It may make me a chump, but a criminal? No.”</p><p>Rockwell has not made any formal statements as of yet, and is currently facing at least three counts of fraud, obstruction of justice, and treason. If found guilty, he is likely to receive life in prison.</p><p>This arrest takes place only two days after George Wallace announced his third party bid for the Presidency. Running under the American Independent Party, with which Mr. Perez is currently affiliated, Wallace’s platform is not too unlike that of Mr. Rockwell’s during the Virginia Governor Race. Already, Wallace is seeing the downside to this association, as his national polls have all dropped by two points, and he is currently trailing Robert Kennedy in both Tennessee and North Carolina. Some have even claimed that Rockwell approached Wallace for refuge while fleeing across the South, and indeed there were witnesses who placed Rockwell in Montgomery just one week ago.</p><p>Several of Rockwell’s actions as governor are currently under review by the new administration and the Virginia House of Representatives. His short tenure as Governor included several efforts… <em>Continued on Page 5</em></p> </div> </font>"

After days of counting and recounting, a victor has finally been declared in the hotly contested race for the Governor’s Mansion of Virginia.</p><p>The election, which took place last Tuesday, was one of the closest in recent history, a three way race between Democratic candidate and Lieutenant Governor Mills Godwin, Republican candidate Linwood Holton, and the insurgent third party bid of George Lincoln Rockwell, a far-right candidate put forward by segregationist groups in the state and Commander of the local Traditional American Party, a racial separatist organization.</p><p>In a shocking turn of events, a third party has won a gubernatorial race for the first time since 1942, with Rockwell officially being declared Governor-Elect late last evening, the first non-Democrat to do so in Virginia since 1881.</p><p>With less than twenty-four hours since his official victory, already we are seeing the ripple of Rockwell’s upset, across both the state and the nation. Black communities have taken to the streets in protest, with an immediate uptick in racial violence. President Goldwater, who has been mired in controversy over the ongoing war in Vietnam, made a televised speech this morning, saying “There are risks involved with electing leaders who have hate stained hearts.” For his part, incumbent Governor Harrison has announced preparations for the transition of power next January.</p><p>We sent a correspondent to the T.A.P. headquarters in Arlington, where many party members were openly celebrating the historic victory. Rockwell himself expressed his eagerness to get to work, giving the following statement: “Well, I'm not one to get cocky, but I don't want to mince words here. This is a great, great victory, for all Whites, and I don't hesitate to admit that I will do anything, absolutely anything, to ensure the survival and happiness of our White, Western People.” Later he added, “But I don't want to create a false sense of our progress. Even Rome, during its decline, never reached the depths to which America has already sunk. Soon enough I think something will give, and it'll become necessary for us White Christian Patriots to step up, and not just in one state.” Some are speculating this is an indication of his intentions for the 1968 presidential election. Recent polls have shown that across the several Southern states, Rockwell’s name recognition has risen above 85%, with 65% of respondents saying they would vote for him in a national election.</p><p>Rockwell will be officially sworn in as Governor on January 15th, 1966.
