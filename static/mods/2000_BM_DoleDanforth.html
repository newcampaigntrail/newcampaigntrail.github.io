GEPHARDT CONCEDES.</h4>\n\nPresident Robert J. Dole of Kansas, at the age of 77 years old, has been re-elected, winning his party a second term in the Oval Office, in a close election against the Speaker of the House, Richard Gephardt. In a stark comparison to four years ago, Dole is expected to win the popular vote against his challenger; however, due to the election being close, this can shift; however, his lead is unlikely to change.<br><br>\nAccording to sources within the Gephardt campaign, they calculated around an hour ago that it was mathematically impossible for them to defeat the President. That is when he began to prepare his concession speech, which he is set to deliver in under a half hour from now. He also gave a concession phone call to President Dole about 5 minutes ago. Dole reportedly received the call with grace and even cracked a few jokes with him.<br><br>It seems the House of Representatives will stay in control of the Democratic Party for at least two more years. The Senate meanwhile, has been projected to remain in GOP control, therefore retaining the divided government which was established in the 1998 midterms.<br><br>This election marks the beginning of the end of an era as Dole, a decorated World War II veteran, is almost certainly going to be the final president from the Greatest Generation. He is expected to give his victory speech shortly after Gephardt gives his concession speech. He will be sworn in for his second term on January 20th, 2001, and will serve until January 20th, 2005, as he is term limited. CNN will cover his second inauguration and any potential cabinet changes in the coming days, so please stay tuned.</div>",

    <h4>CONGRESS CLEARS WAY FOR GEPHARDT TO BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT IN THE AFTERMATH OF LAST NOVEMBER'S ELECTION DEADLOCK. SENATE ELECTS KEMP FOR A SECOND TERM AS VICE PRESIDENT. FIRST BIPARTISAN ADMINISTRATION SINCE 1797.</h4>
    <p>The once-in-a-lifetime electoral college deadlock of last November has finally been settled. The Democratic Party's nominee for president, the Speaker of the House, Richard Andrew Gephardt of Missouri, has been elevated to the presidency despite energetic efforts from Minority Leader Dick Armey to convince Blue Dogs to vote for Dole.</p>
    <p>In stark contrast, however, it seems the Senate has decided to re-elect incumbent Vice President Jack Kemp over former Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who was Gephardt's running mate in the election. This effectively promotes Kemp as the GOP's forefront leader, giving him a lofty position if he decides to run for president in 2004.</p>
    <p>A mixed administration has not been seen since the days of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, so the situation could become feral easily; however, President-elect Gephardt and Vice President Kemp are already in discussions about how a Gephardt-Kemp administration will look. Sources on Capitol Hill allege that Gephardt has expressed openness to retaining some of the Dole Administration's secretaries, such as Secretary of State Colin Powell.</p>
    <p>This election marks the end of an era as Dole, a decorated World War II veteran, is almost certainly going to be the final president from the Greatest Generation. The President-elect is expected to give a speech to the nation at the Capitol shortly. He will be sworn in for his first term on January 20th, 2001, and will serve that term until January 20th, 2005, upon which he is eligible for a second term.
