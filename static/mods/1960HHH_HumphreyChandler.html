You are most likely to be confirmed by the House, as it remains in Democratic hands, although Faubus could strike a deal with Nixon to give him his electors.<p>This is an interesting outcome for all sides, and certainly raises the question on the long-term viability of the electoral college. The Democratic Party is certainly looking into a way to stop this from occuring, such as a proportional voting system, or RCV. Regardless, you need to get some sleep, you'll need it for the negotiating you'll need to be doing soon. Good luck, Senator Humphrey.</q></p>`;

Neither was Humphrey able to take advantage of this, as his campaign crashed and burned under rumors of being infiltrated by the reds, leading to the most unlikely conclusion.<p>As it stands now, Orval Faubus is going to have a really hard time getting much of anything done in Congress, as his only real allies are Dixie-aligned Democrats and Republicans, with the rest of both parties being outwardly hostile to his rhetoric. It's safe to say that you're unlikely to make a comeback bid to the White House for quite some time, given that you fumbled so hard that a Southern splinter campaign outvoted you.</q></p>`;
