  <p>I wanna thank a couple of people who not only contributed to WOLWOT but to my enjoyment of making it.</p>
  <p>First off, I want to thank all my playtesters, y'all really made me proud of what I've done. To anyone who wants to make a mod, its tedious and boring at times, so it really helps to have people behind you and your work.</p>
  <p>To Captain Tom, I really want to thank you for your enthusiasm about the path for Stassen. Without it, I don't know if I would have been as driven to make sure it did him or anyone else justice.</p>
  <p>To the TNCT discord server, thank you for everything. It was you who set the bar for the quality of WOLWOT, and without you, WOLWOT may have been a disaster. To the entire Mod Help channel, thank you for checking my code for bugs, when I was exhausted and fed up with it.</p>
  <p>Lastly, I want to thank Statichaos for creating the World of Laughter, World of Tears timeline. This whole project would not exist without you or your creativity. I'll try to link your original althistory.com post (If I can figure out the further reading section lol)</p>
  <p>I hope you all enjoyed this mod as much as I enjoyed making it. Stay tuned for WOLWOT 1956!</p>
