He has even floated eliminating the income tax and funding the federal government solely through a universal tariff. What do you think of these policies?"], [1052, "Earlier this year, negotiations for the bipartisan Sinema-Lankford immigration bill collapsed after Donald Trump loudly and publicly opposed it. Since then, the border issue has only grown in salience. Where do you stand on this issue?"], [20749, "Recently, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down the state’s six-week abortion ban, ruling that it violated the Georgia Constitution. Abortion has been a salient political issue since the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, and has been credited with single-handedly halting Republican momentum in 2022. How do you plan to approach abortion rights as you campaign?"], [20736, "Biden's numbers amongst young voters were rather dire - advisors believe that the best way to reconnect with these voters is via the internet. @BidenHQ on 𝕏 (formerly known as Twitter) has been renamed to @KamalaHQ, for example. What exactly should you do with social media in this campaign?"], [20747, "Although you have a platform you ran on in 2020, your nomination presents you with a unique opportunity to hedge some of these proposals, or double down on them. What will you do in this regard?"], [20748, "How much do you wish to talk about democracy as an issue during this campaign?"], [20750, "Feeling extra confident on his chances before Biden's withdraw, Donald Trump was convinced by his son to choose Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate. Do you have anything to say on the selection of Mr. Vance?"], [20751, "Initially coined by your own running mate, the claim that Republicans are ''weird'' has become a favorite line for Democratic surrogates on the campaign trail. Is this something you want to incorporate at all into your rhetoric?"], [1055, "Early this summer, Donald Trump became the first former President to become a felon, convicted on 34 felonies for falsifying business documents in a scheme to prevent his affair with Stormy Daniels from hitting the headlines during the 2016 election. How do you plan on talking about this as you campaign?"], [1077, "President Biden has sent you word that he intends to block the proposed 14.9 billion dollar takeover of U.S. Steel by Japanese firm Nippon Steel, citing security risks in having American steel production controlled by foreign entities. What public position will you take on this?"]];

Your advisors have proposed a litany of ideas to remedy this, including restating your support for legalizing marijuana, coming out with a plank of policy proposals specifically targeted to benefit Black men, and maybe even an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. What do you think about these ideas?"], [1068, "You have received the support of numerous neoconservative establishment Republicans, including Dick and Liz Cheney, Jimmy McCain (son of John McCain), former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, and others. How do you want to emphasize this as you campaign?"], [1069, "You are sitting down for your first 60 Minutes interview as the Democratic nominee for President when host Bill Whitaker asks you the following question: “Which country do you consider to be our greatest foreign adversary?”"], [1063, "The South has been ravaged by major hurricanes Helene and Milton, leaving hundreds dead and millions without power due to severe wind, rain, and flooding. Beyond an obligatory visit to the relief effort in disaster-affected areas, how will you respond?"], [1067, "During your 2020 presidential campaign, you established yourself as a strong supporter of Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” healthcare plan, which would establish a single-payer national health insurance system. Where do you stand on healthcare now?"], [1071, "“No daylight, kid.” Joe doesn’t have to elaborate for you to understand exactly what he means. It was supposed to be a pre-debate pep talk, but it comes off more as a threat than anything else, and Bidenworld is backing him up. You have to make a decision. It might be the defining decision of your campaign."], [1053, "Recently, prominent Republicans, including Trump, Vance, and Senator Ted Cruz, have begun to promote discredited rumors that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio have been abducting and eating the pet cats and dogs of native residents. Is there anything you need to say about these bizarre claims?"], [20843, "As expected, there are multiple third party bids on the left that seek to siphon votes from your campaign. The Green Party has nominated Jill Stein yet again, while Independent Cornel West and PSL nominee Claudia De la Cruz are also on many ballots. Do you have anything to say about these campaigns?"], [20888, "For as long as people can remember, tariffs have been a staple of Donald Trump’s economic policy. Now though, he’s called for the larger and larger tariff rates - even suggesting a 1000% tariff rate as part of his boldly protectionist platform. How will you talk about these plans, and do you think tariffs are good for the economy?"], [83927, "You’re making a guest appearance on ABC News’ The View when co-host Sunny Hoskin asks if you would have done anything differently than President Biden over the past four years. What’s your answer?
