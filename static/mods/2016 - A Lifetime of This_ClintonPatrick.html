            5155: "Look, folks, here’s the deal. Joe’s been in the room where it happens for eight years. There is literally no one more prepared to be Vice President on day one. It’s a no-brainer, really.",
            5156: "I chose a partner who can speak directly to the folks in Scranton and across the Rust Belt. Joe understands their values and their struggles better than anyone in Washington, and he served the state of Delaware admirably for over 30 years.",

            5263: "This isn’t about looking back, it’s about building on our progress. Joe and I are going to take the successes of the last eight years and supercharge them to create the strongest, fairest economy in American history."

            5262: "To be fair, there are many laws Biden voted for in the 1990s that would make progressives tremble, and not in a good way. But who knows; maybe they like blenders?",

As a gift, he sends you a pot of Häagen-Dazs® chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream after one of your rallies; attached to it is a note. “This is Joe’s favorite,” the note reads. “He can eat a whole pint in one sitting.

            5262: "Honestly, this is just ridiculous. Being the mayor of a major American city like San Antonio and a member of the Presidential Cabinet is more executive experience than Donald Trump and many other Republicans will ever have. He’s ready, period.",

		<p>You turn to Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership in the House. Behind closed doors in the Speaker’s office, you promise key committee chairs to wavering members and commit to supporting their pet projects in your first hundred days.</p>
		<p>The whip count is brutal. You need every single Democratic vote <i>plus</i> a couple of Republican defectors. After 72 hours of intense negotiations, you secure the razor-thin majority you needed.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>The gavel fell, and just like that, it was over. The chamber didn’t erupt in cheers. It was quieter than that, actually. I had won. And what a victory that was.</p> <p>Every promise I’d made was an IOU written in my blood. Pretty much a mortgage was taken out on the soul of my presidency before it even drew its first breath. Oh boy. A piece of the EPA for a wavering vote from Colorado, a slice of the defense budget for a hawk in Virginia… my presidency was carved up and served on a platter to keep the wolves at bay. And I had sold the office to save it.</p> <p>Outside, the winter air over Washington was very unforgiving. The television screens were already on fire; Trump wasn’t screaming about a rigged election anymore, no. Now, he had a new story, a better one, forged in the truth of my compromise. He called it the "Corrupt Bargain of the Century", said I was so corrupt I was redefining the definition of corrupt. That I had bought the presidency, or that I had done with Congress what Tony Blair had done to Gordon Brown in 1994, when both wanted the leadership of the Labour Party. None of this was the case, or at least not in the way they said it was, but what could I say? The news anchors, those thieving bastards, spoke of a constitutional crisis, and of a Hillary administration whose legitimacy was dead on arrival.</p> <p>I stood in a quiet office overlooking the Capitol dome. My friend, Nancy Pelosi, had offered me a glass of champagne, but I declined. Staring at the bubbles would’ve made me feel like I was swallowing glass. She saw the look on my face. “We did what we had to do, Hillary,” she said, her voice a low whisper, as if the walls themselves were listening. “It was this, or <i>him</i>.”</p> <p>She was right, of course. It was a hard choice, but it was a choice. I was given the choice between a poisoned chalice and a loaded gun to the nation’s head. I could never live with the death of America. And so I chose the poison, hoping I could find the antidote later. But looking out at the city, I knew there was no antidote. There wasn’t. I hated saying this, but there wasn’t. The sickness was already in the bloodstream.</p> <p>The half a dozen “moderate” Republican defectors who saved me would be, eventually, retiring. They hailed from districts I’d won by double digits, and were already pariahs in the making. Paul Ryan wouldn’t live with that, no no. And neither would they. Their political careers were dead, and I was the one who had pulled the trigger. And their "profiles in courage" only reminded me of the price of power, whatever this meant at this point. They were not the first.</p> <p>Soon, I would have to walk out and give a speech. I’d have to talk about healing, about coming together, about being a president for all Americans and all that. The words were already forming on my tongue. But how do you unite a country when you began by proving its worst suspicions true? That power was a commodity, bought and sold by people who smiled while holding a knife behind their back?</p> <p>I had wanted this job my whole life. I’d climbed a really tall mountain, clawed my way up the sheer rock face through storms of scandal and rivers of doubt… and now here I was, at the summit. But it wasn’t a peak like I thought it would be. It was actually a ledge overlooking a chasm. The phone on the desk in front of me buzzed. It was my first call in prison.</p> <p>I had won the White House. But standing there, in the quiet dark, I felt like the biggest loser in the world. I fucked up. The real fight hadn’t ended with the vote. If anything, it had just begun, and I was starting it with my hands tied and my back against the wall.</p>

        <p>You reach out to conservative Democrats who have grown uncomfortable with the party’s leftward shift. You promise to moderate your positions on gun control and environmental regulations, hoping to appeal to their rural constituencies.</p>
		<p>It’s not an easy strategy.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>They called themselves “Blue Dogs”. I should have known a stray would bite the hand that tried to pet it. To be fair, the Blue Dogs were a dying species; they got whooped in 2010 and whoever was left got whooped by 2014. But I still believed that, in their hearts, they could understand the points I was making. The news broke on a flickering TV in a borrowed, rather forgotten office in the Rayburn building: “CLINTON GAMBLE FAILS: CONSERVATIVE DEMS TO BACK TRUMP.” Well, fuck.</p> <p>A staffer, barely old enough to remember my first run, turned off the screen as if that could stop the bleeding. It couldn’t. No, it couldn’t. That wound was mortal. I had reached across the aisle inside my own party, and they had sawn my arm off at the shoulder. Those bastards. They’d labeled me part of the “coastal elite”. It was a two-dollar insult from men whose districts I could have bought with a single fundraiser. And yet it stuck, and worked its way to the heart. Their hearts, that is.</p> <p>I had offered them a compromise. I’d offered to sand the edges off my platform, to speak their language, and to give them a shield to take back home, something none of the Republicans would’ve done. But they didn’t want it. And I knew why: they looked at me and saw the ghost of every factory that had closed, every regulation they hated, and every cultural battle they felt they were losing. To them, I wasn’t a potential president; I was a symbol of their decline. And by voting for Trump, they could turn the page, they thought. They were all very, very happy to watch the whole system go up in smoke.</p> <p>The progressives, who I’d nearly alienated with my offer, were now silent. Not only had I failed at my bridge-making efforts, but I had unintentionally dynamited both sides of the canyon, leaving me stranded in the middle with nothing but the fall below. They fucking Wile E. Coyote’d me. I was toxic to the left, a traitor to the center, and a punchline to the right. Hell, was anyone even on my side?</p> <p>Washington felt different now. Its beautiful monuments didn’t seem like symbols of enduring democracy anymore.</p> <p>“We should get you out of here,” my Secret Service agent said. His name was Rob, I think, and he was trained for threats you could see, for bullets and bombs. He obviously had no protocol for this. We didn’t take the main entrance; we took the back ways, the service tunnels and empty corridors, like I was a fugitive fleeing my own life. As I walked, it seemed like every portrait of a past leader on the walls seemed to stare at me with accusing eyes. What would they say if they looked at me?</p> <p>Our car was waiting in a secluded loading dock, and by then rain was beginning to slick the asphalt. The drops on the window looked a lot like prison bars. As we pulled out into the gridlocked traffic, the city was a blur of red taillights and neon. So much neon, what the hell. Trump was probably on TV, though I didn’t really care what he would say anymore. If anything, he had it easy; he didn’t have to rig or collude or whatever. He just had to wait! And so he did, waiting for us to tear ourselves apart. It’s like I had handed him the knife and told him to stab me.</p> <p>There was a long, dark road ahead, with no destination for me in sight. What I had just witnessed could’ve been the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare. It isn’t.</p><p><i>It’s the beginning.</i></p>

        <p>In an unprecedented move, you reach across the aisle to moderate Republicans uncomfortable with Trump’s divisive rhetoric. You offer them significant input on Supreme Court nominations and promise a more centrist approach to fiscal policy.</p>
        <p>After tense negotiations led by senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, a couple of Republican representatives break ranks, citing the need for "healing and unity" in these turbulent times.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>The final tally flickered onto the screen: I was the 45th President of the United States. It felt less like a victory and more like a diagnosis, however. Of course, the press was already spinning the narrative and painting it as a moment of national grace, a triumph of pragmatism over partisanship. How enlightening. “Healing and Unity.” The words sounded pretty under the bright lights of the TV cameras, and they did look pretty; it might’ve been the font they used. And yet, to an extent, it sounded just like the terms of a surrender.</p> <p>The Republicans who crossed the aisle might’ve saved the country from Trump, but this also meant that I owned them. The first vacancy on the Court wouldn’t be mine; it would be theirs. Garland would have a hard time anyway trying to get past them, unless he’d still be up for it. The upcoming budget and my fiscal policy would definitely make my own party’s blood run cold.</p> <p>I was President, but my hands were tied. Every decision would be a negotiation, and every bill a battle on two, three, four, many, many fronts. The right would hold the concessions over my head like a guillotine, and the left… the left would never forgive me.</p> <p>The calls from my own side had already started. They weren’t congratulatory, not at all. They were accusations. The venom in their voices was hotter than any Republican attack. I had betrayed their cause, and sold out the platform for a tainted title. What a "Madam President" I was, they said. To them, I hadn’t prevented a disaster; I had become one. It’s like I was a Trojan horse for the very policies we’d fought against. I was a president with no party, a leader with no followers, and forced to go along with "bipartisanship" while the sharks from both sides circled.</p> <p>I looked out the window at the Washington Monument, piercing the gray sky like a needle. I had wanted to heal a divided nation. Instead, I had just institutionalized the division inside the Oval Office itself. My administration would be in a permanent state of war, essentially.</p> <p>The history books would call it the “Grand Compromise”, or whatever they’d name it. It’d be a very neat, tidy, respectable name for what was more of a hostage situation. I had stared into the abyss of a Trump presidency and flinched. Instead, I walked into a prison built for me, and willingly locked the door from the inside.</p> <p>Someone knocked. Ugh. It was time to go out and face the cameras, to smile and talk about the dawning of a new day. I practiced my smile in the reflection of the dark window. It looked like a grimace. God, I was such a damsel in distress. I was the woman who had finally broken the highest, hardest glass ceiling… and yet all I could feel were the shards under my feet, and the cold draft coming through the hole where my power was supposed to be. I had the title, the office, the Chaos Emeralds. Hell, I had saved the republic. And in the process, I had lost everything.</p><p>It’s morning in America.</p>

        <p>After thinking of your choices, you wondered if this one was possible. You couldn’t believe it. A single phone call with the man himself. No. No…</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>The ride to Trump Tower was silent. My chief of staff stared out the window, as if the gray Manhattan skyline held some profound answer he couldn’t find in my face. It didn’t. Unfortunately, there were no answers here, only consequences. We were ushered up to his penthouse, a place I had only ever seen in glossy magazine spreads. It was even bigger in person, honestly. There was gold everywhere. I didn’t even know if it was real gold or fake gold, but it was definitely gold. Quite the declaration that taste, after all, was for losers. I felt very out of place there.</p>
        <p>Trump was there, waiting, and flanked by his children, who looked on with a mixture of suspicion and, strangely, some piety. I tried not to stare too much at them. Trump, of course, was very excited. “Hillary! Welcome! We’re going to do something great today, really great.” The small talk was excruciating. He talked about his golf courses, about the ratings the press conference would get, all that shit. I just nodded and smiled; it felt like there was only white noise in my mind. But I also knew this was the only way to stop a constitutional crisis, to end the deadlock, and to prevent months of chaos that would tear the country apart. It was a rational, logical choice. Right? And yet, every instinct in my body was screaming that I had just walked into a trap of historic proportions.</p>
        <p>Then it was time. We walked out to the atrium, to a forest of cameras and a sea of many expectant faces. Oh God. What would they print about this? I felt the burn of a thousand lenses over my retina, and I knew they were all trying to decipher what was going on in here. Who am I? Why am I here? These questions echoed in the spaces of my mind. Standing beside him felt like an out-of-body experience. He stepped to the podium first, of course.</p>
        <p>“We had a tough campaign,” he began. “A very, very tough campaign. People said a lot of things. The fake news media, you know— they’re not happy, I can tell you. They’re very unhappy people. But we both love this country. We love this country more than anything.” He paused, letting the statement hang in the air. “And when you love America, you do what’s right for America. You make deals. You make the best deals.”</p>
        <p>A reporter from, I think, Vox, would later liken my vacant, twitchy expression to Harmony Korine at Cannes in ’95, trying to explain — or in his case, not explain — his unexplainable film, “Kids”. At that moment, he wasn’t entirely wrong. If you’re a passenger in, say, a roller coaster, you’re gonna wait for it to crest the hill. Usually, it does. Ours did, unfortunately. “So we sat down,” Trump continued, leaning into the microphone. He truly was a showman at heart. “And we came to an agreement. It’s an amazing agreement, a historic agreement. Something nobody’s ever seen before. Hillary Clinton… she fought hard, very hard, I saw that… and she will be the next President of the United States.”</p>
        <p>A wave of gasps and frantic murmurs rippled through the press corps. He rapidly held up a hand, silencing them with a gesture. “And I… <i>I</i> will be proud to serve this country. I will be proud to serve as her <i>Vice President</i>.”</p>
        <p>And there it was. The words landed in the room with the force of a physical blow. He said it. He fucking said it. The deal was real. My mind, which had been blissfully, mercifully blank until then, snapped back into focus with rather painful clarity. This was happening. Trump beamed. “We are going to do a tremendous job,” he declared, his voice rising. “We are going to fix our country. We are going to bring back our jobs. And we are going to Make America Great Again—Together!”</p>
        <p>He turned to me, his smile wide, and grabbed my hand. On autopilot, my own facial muscles contorted into what I hoped was, and probably was, a smile. We stood up. He raised our joined hands in the air; his hands were smaller than I had thought. For a split second, the room was utterly silent. And then, it erupted. Not with boos or questions or anything like that, but with surprising, thunderous, and stunning applause. They were clapping. They were all clapping. For the deal, for the show? I had no clue. But maybe it was for the audacity of it all.</p>
        <p>The walk offstage was such a blur, I almost couldn’t remember what happened next. In the elevator back up, no one spoke. Nor in the car on the way back home. Or maybe they did say something, but I genuinely didn’t recall. I had the presidency. I had done what I set out to do. I had stopped him from taking the highest office, which was an achievement in itself. But I hadn’t <i>defeated</i> him. Worse: I had absorbed him. It was funny to imagine that the presidency had turned from an office into a joint venture in such quick time, but actually— no, no, it was different. It was like a reality show with two headliners.</p><p>But I knew who the real star would always be.</p>

The maneuver, described by one onlooker as “pretty good, maybe a little close to the curb,” preceded a brief trip into the local DeCicco & Sons Market.</p> <p>Inside, dressed in a black jacket, Mrs. Clinton was seen navigating the produce aisle, pausing to inspect a bunch of kale before moving on to the dairy section. She offered polite smiles to the few shoppers who recognized her, eventually purchasing a carton of milk, a bag of quinoa, and a rotisserie chicken.</p> <p>“Oh yes, she and the President [Bill Clinton] come in from time to time,” remarked Brenda Scofield, 62, a retired teacher bagging her groceries nearby. “We just try to give them their space. They’re our neighbors, after all.”</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton has kept a decidedly low profile since the conclusion to last fall’s presidential contest, which saw her fail to win any of the 50 states in the country and their votes in the Electoral College. Aside from occasional walks in the nearby woods with her husband and their dogs, a local pastime that has gained some national attention, she has made few public appearances since.</p> <p>However, whispers in local Democratic circles have begun to circulate about a potential next act. With veteran Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY17), 79, reportedly mulling retirement ahead of the 2018 midterms, some party insiders have quietly wondered if Mrs. Clinton might consider a run for the House of Representatives. Such a move would allow her to re-enter the political fray, representing the community she has called home for nearly two decades.</p> <p>When asked by this reporter for comment on her parking technique or future political plans, the former First Lady simply offered a warm smile and a slight wave before loading her groceries into her vehicle. For now, it seems her most immediate concern isn’t holding a congressional district, but simply getting home before the ice cream melts.</p> </div>`);

The second one was Ohio. But the one that broke the spell was Pennsylvania. The networks called it at 1:36 a.m. With it, the red bar for Trump nudged past the threshold, and the state on the holographic TV map flickered from toss-up gray to a deep, final crimson.<br/><br/>No one screamed. No one threw anything. The sound that followed was worse: a collective exhalation, as if a hundred people or so had been holding their breath for eighteen months and had all let it go at once. If anything, it felt like whatever energy they had was sucked out of them entirely. They had already abandoned the Javits Center hours ago, and were in a random Manhattan hotel waiting for a miracle that wasn’t coming.<br/><br/>Hillary stood before the wall of screens, her expression unreadable. She had watched the Blue Wall, the firewall she had been assured would hold, crumble brick by brick. Michigan was bleeding, Wisconsin was gone, and she didn’t even wanna think about Minnesota. This wasn’t like a normal landslide, no, it was like a death by a thousand cuts... each one a precinct in a county she’d never heard of, and each one a vote <i>she</i> was supposed to have. The final margin wouldn’t be a chasm.<br/><br/>Slowly, as if moving through water, she walked to the main television. She picked up the remote from a table littered with half-empty coffee cups and some binders. With a quiet <i>click</i>, the screen went black. It was over.<br/><br/>The sudden silence was absolute. In the dark glass of the TV, she saw not a President-elect, but a woman. Tired. Impossibly tired, too, with lines around her eyes that not even the best makeup could hide, and her reflection was so pale she looked as if she had seen a ghost.<br/><br/>Bill moved to her side and put a hand on her arm. His voice was quite low. “Hillary… Barack is on the line. He thinks… h-he says for the good of the country, we should think about a concession call.”<br/><br/>She didn’t turn to look at him. She just kept staring at the TV screen. “I want to go home, Bill.”<br/><br/>“I know,” he said gently. “But the markets, the transition… we need a smooth transfer of power, Hill. We have to show…”<br/><br/>“No,” she said. Her voice wasn’t sharp or angry, although it was quite flat. “I want to go home. Please.”<br/><br/>He looked from his wife to the stunned faces of Podesta and Huma and the rest of her inner circle, all standing frozen. They looked like figures in a wax museum. It was pathetic. And he saw the truth in her eyes. Their fight was over. There was nothing left to give them anymore. And so he nodded. “Okay,” he whispered. “Okay, honey. We’ll go home.”<br/><br/>The ride to Chappaqua was a silent, rather surreal journey through a world that no longer belonged to her. The Secret Service motorcade moved through the sleeping suburbs of New York. She didn’t even want to think about the thousands of Hillary voters in this area who were having it just as bad as her, if not worse. Hillary leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, watching the streetlights streak by in blurry lines of gold and white and some red.<br/><br/>Why? This question wasn’t just political analysis, unfortunately. What had she done? She’d built a working coalition, she’d won the debates, she’d endured every attack, every smear, and every resurrected ghost from their long, public life. She had been told, and had believed, that she was the most qualified person to ever seek the office. And it wasn’t enough. Shit. By the barest of margins, in just the right places, it wasn’t enough. Was it the emails? Was it Russia? Was it fucking James Comey? Or was it something more fundamental? Was it… <i>her</i>? The question echoed in her mind. She didn’t want to answer it.<br/><br/>They pulled into their driveway just before 3 a.m. The house was understandably dark and quiet, and it was a sanctuary that felt worlds away from the noise and the numbers of NYC. Bill unlocked the front door, and the familiar scent of home washed over them. It was hard to describe it, but it felt good.<br/><br/>Hillary walked into the living room, letting her purse slide from her shoulder and hit the floor with a soft thud. She looked at the living room couch — it was a normal couch, to be honest, but at least she could call it comfortable — and sighed. Her legs seemed to give way beneath her. She sank onto the cushions, curled into a ball, pulled a pillow into her chest and held it like a toy.<br/><br/>Bill was there in an instant. He sat on the edge of the couch, and let his hand rest on her back, rubbing slow, gentle circles between her shoulder blades. He didn’t speak. There were no words for this, no good words for it, at least. There was no talk of tomorrow; tomorrow was a foreign country. Trump threatened to lock her up. His supporters wanted her dead. Hillary didn’t know what else awaited her.<br/><br/>She didn’t cry. Her grief was probably too deep for tears. It was just a cold, heavy stone in her stomach. She lay there, thinking about all the work, all the hope, the hands she’d shaken, the babies she’d held, and all the the stories she’d listened to. All of it had, somehow, led to this. To her being in a dark room, with a silent phone, and a few questions that would haunt her for the rest of her life.<br/><br/><i>Why? Why now? What had I done to the world to deserve this?</i><br/><br/>She didn’t know. And as her husband sat beside her, she had a terrifying feeling that perhaps, she never would.</p></div>`);

She’d turned it off somewhere between Florida falling and the inevitable mathematics of defeat becoming undeniable. Outside, November rain tapped against the hotel window.<br/><br/>It wasn’t supposed to happen this way. No, no, not after everything. Not after building her ground game, gaining endorsements, and the coalition-building that she had taken years to construct. Not after being told she was the most qualified candidate in history, for God’s sake. Not like <i>this</i>. But here she was, watching her future dissolve in real time, state by state, vote by vote.<br/><br/>The phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was Huma’s phone, apparently forgotten in the rush of the night’s unraveling. The caller ID read “Conway, K.” Hillary sighed. She picked it up anyway. What else was there to do?<br/><br/>“Huma? Oh-oh, Mrs. Clinton? This is Kellyanne Conway. I—well, I wanted to—” There was a pause. “Uh, here, let me put him on.”<br/><br/>Trump’s voice came through surprisingly tinny. “Hillary? Wow. I mean, wow. That happened, huh? I don’t—I don’t even know what to say. You ran a great campaign, really, I mean it. Great campaign. The best. Really tremendous. Better than anyone expected, to be honest. I don’t know what happened, you probably don’t either, right? These things, they just—they happen, you know? The American people, they spoke, and I respect that. I really do. We both do, right?”<br/><br/>“Yeah,” she said, although she was not sure if she was being fully honest or not. “Yeah, we do.”<br/><br/>“You know, Hillary, you’re very talented. Very smart. Always said that. I told you this at my wedding, right? It was a great wedding, too. Even when we disagreed—and we disagreed a lot, didn’t we?—I always said Hillary’s smart. Really smart. Scary smart, actually. Maybe we should work together, you know? I’m gonna need good people. The best people. And you’re good people, Hillary. Really good. Maybe Secretary of State again? You were good at that. I don’t know, UN Ambassador? We’ll figure it out. We’ll make it work.”<br/><br/>“Sure,” she heard herself say. “Sure, Donald.”<br/><br/>“See? That’s what I’m talking about. Unity. That’s what this country needs. Unity, healing. And you and me, we can do that. We’re both New Yorkers, right? Well, sorta. But we understand each other. We get it. The media, they don’t get it, but we do. We’re dealmakers, we make things happen. That’s why—I mean, tonight was crazy, wasn’t it? Just crazy. Nobody saw this coming. Nobody. Well, maybe some people did, but I definitely didn’t. It was insane. Have you seen those numbers in Indiana? E-Evan Bayh, that little guy, he tried so hard. And yet he died like a dog. Crazy stuff.”<br/><br/>“Mm-hmm.” She nodded at her reflection in the dark window. At that point, some numbness had settled in almost completely. Although strange, it felt quite familiar.<br/><br/>“And the rallies, Hillary—did you see the rallies? The crowds were incredible. Really incredible. Thousands and thousands of people. Beautiful MAGA people. Great Americans. They really wanted change, you know? Real change. Not that I’m saying you weren’t change—you would have been change too, in your own way. A different kind of change. Historic change, actually. First woman president, that would have been something. But they wanted my kind of change, I guess. Who knows? Politics, right? It’s crazy. Really crazy business. Always has been.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, you too, Donald.” The words came out automatically.<br/><br/>“You too what? Oh, right, yeah. Thanks. You’re very gracious, Hillary. Very classy. Always said that about you. Classy lady, presidential, really. That’s why I think we could really work together. Make America Great Again, but together, you know? That would be funny. Can you believe it? The media would love that, they’d eat it up. It’s like having your cake and eating it too. Think about it. ’Hillary Clinton joins the Trump administration.’ CNN would double their ratings. Think about the fake news media, how would they react. Can you imagine? Better than The Apprentice, probably.”<br/><br/>“Sounds good,” she whispered, her breath fogging the window for a moment before disappearing. Like, well, everything else tonight.<br/><br/>“I mean, we could do infrastructure. You always talked about infrastructure. Roads, bridges, airports. I love building things. We could build together. Make deals. Great deals, beautiful deals. The greatest deals anyone’s ever seen. We’re gonna redefine the definition of a deal. China wouldn’t know what hit them. Russia either. We’d show these losers what we can do.”<br/><br/>“Mm-hmm.” The rain kept falling, each drop sliding down the glass, as was expected.<br/><br/>She thought about her mother suddenly. Oh, Dorothy, who had traveled across the country on a train as a child, abandoned and alone. She’d told that story so many times during the campaign, about wanting to go back and tell that little girl that her daughter would grow up to be president. But now that train was disappearing into the distance, and the little girl would never know. The future Hillary had promised her was gone.<br/><br/>“You know what, Hillary? I’m really glad we’re talking like this. Really glad. Shows we’re both bigger than the campaign, you know? Bigger than the attacks and the ads and all that stuff. That’s politics. Business is business, but this is different. This is about America. About making things better. And we can do that. Together. I really believe that.”<br/><br/>“Yeah,” she said again, though the word was barely audible. “Yeah, Donald.”<br/><br/>For all that mattered, she was already gone. The person who had walked into this room hours ago, the one who had believed, who had planned, and had seen tomorrow stretching out in front of her like a golden highway — well, that person had died somewhere between the first swing state falling and the moment she reached for the remote. What remained was just a mere echo, nodding at random promises that would never be fulfilled, while the rain washed away the last traces of things that might have been.<br/><br/>And the phone kept buzzing with Trump’s voice, enthusiastic and uncertain all at once. But Hillary Clinton had already left the building. She was somewhere else now, in a place where eighteen months of fighting and hoping and dreaming couldn’t reach her. It was somewhere where the weight of history and the expectations of millions couldn’t follow her.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was true that the past is a gaping hole. She ran from it, so far away, and after it grew to an unbelievable size — think of, say, a snowball —, she decided to fight back. She lost.<br/><br/>She was dead on arrival, and she knew it. The rest was just paperwork.</span></p></div>`);

It was something with just enough beat to move to, and just enough joy to lift her spirits. Hillary found herself in the center of it all. It was funny, too — she was spinning with her arms outstretched, laughing in a way that felt both foreign and familiar. The room was pulsing with energy. There were faces beaming at her from every direction, and it was not hard to guess why.</p><p>She was grinning! Actually grinning, and it felt wonderful. When was the last time she’d smiled like this? It was not her usual campaign smile, but it was this pure, unguarded joy that seemed to bubble up from somewhere deep inside her chest.</p><p>There was a kaleidoscope of supporters and staffers and friends, all moving to the same rhythm, swirling around her. It was amazing. She caught glimpses of familiar faces within the blur; she was pretty sure she saw Huma there. There was a laugh that was almost certainly Podesta’s, but the rest was all very blurry.</p><p>She spun faster and faster, and the room was becoming a whirl of golden light. Her feet felt light, almost like she was floating. This was what victory felt like, she thought. What vindication tasted like, too. Every doubt, every sleepless night, every moment of wondering if she was asking too much of the universe… well, all of it was worth this feeling.</p><p>The music seemed to swell, to lift her higher. Hillary closed her eyes and let herself be carried by it. It was… stunning. Someone was calling her name, but it sounded distant. She was too busy, too. No, she was flying now, spinning in space, untethered from gravity and worry and a lot of other things.</p><p>“Hillary!”</p><p>The voice was sharper now. She kept spinning, kept smiling, but something was tugging at the edges of whatever was going on with her. That golden light was flickering.</p><p>“Hillary, wake up!”</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. The music cut off abruptly, and was replaced by a ringing silence that felt much more empty. She was staring at a ceiling; not the ornate ceiling of a hotel ballroom, no, but the familiar expanse of their living room in Chappaqua. She was at home. The spinning sensation continued for a moment before gradually settling into stillness.</p><p>Hillary was lying on the couch with her head against the armrest. Bill’s worried face was just hovering above her. His hand was on her shoulder.</p><p>“Hey,” he said softly. “Um… you’re okay. You’re home.”</p><p>She blinked, trying to orient herself. What?</p><p>“I was…” she started, then stopped. Had she been dancing? There had been music, she was sure of that. And lights. And a lot of faces, too. She just couldn’t remember all of them.</p><p>“What happened?” she asked, her voice sounding strange to her own ears.</p><p>Bill sat down on the edge of the coffee table, close enough to touch but giving her space to breathe. “I-I found you here about ten minutes ago. You were… I don’t know, it looked like you were dreaming, but your eyes were open. You were smiling and moving like you were dancing, but you wouldn’t respond when I called your name.”</p><p>She sat up slowly, the room tilting slightly before settling. “I… I don’t remember coming in here.”</p><p>“You were in the kitchen making tea,” Bill said carefully. “I heard the kettle whistling from upstairs, but when I came down, the stove was still on and you were here on the couch. Hillary, you were gone for almost twenty minutes.”</p><p><i>What!?</i> Twenty minutes? It had felt like hours in that other place, that… beautiful, shiny space full of music and light and the kind of happiness she’d almost forgotten was possible. But twenty minutes was, honestly, a lot.</p><p>She pressed her palms against her temples, trying to piece together the sequence of events. Tea. Hmm. She remembered wanting tea. Then the kettle, yeah. And then… nothing until the party, the dancing, and the good feeling of being exactly where she was supposed to be.</p><p>“I’m scared,” she whispered, her admission coming out before she could stop it.</p><p>Bill moved closer, taking her hands in his. “Look, we’re going to figure this out. Maybe it’s stress, maybe you’re just exhausted. When’s the last time you really slept?”</p><p>She couldn’t remember that either. The days had been blending together lately, each one carrying the weight of whatever came next, and it seemed she was always busy doing something — especially at this time of year. If anything, it felt like sleep to her had been replaced by some sort of half-conscious state that never felt like true rest.</p><p>“The party felt so real,” she said quietly. “I was so happy there.”</p><p>Bill’s expression softened. He’d watched her carry so much for so long, and had seen the way she held herself together even when the seams were showing. “Tell me about it.”</p><p>But as she tried to describe it, the details slipped away through her fingers. (Figuratively, that is.) There had been music, celebration, sure, and at least a general feeling of everything falling into place. But the specifics were gone.</p><p>Outside, evening was settling over their quiet street. She’d almost forgotten that it was Christmas season. Not that it changed much, of course, but still. She was supposed to be <i>happy</i> and not doing… whatever this was.</p><p>Hillary leaned against Bill’s shoulder, grateful for his solid presence, even as part of her longed to slip back into that other place where everything made sense and happiness wasn’t such a rare and precious thing.</p></div>`);

Then Wisconsin. Then Michigan. The states that were supposed to be hers all along, the ones that had slipped through her fingers like water in every poll, every projection, in every nightmare of her sleepless nights for the past eighteen months… they came home. <br/><br/>Hillary stood backstage at the Javits Center, watching the numbers crawl across the monitors. She couldn’t believe it. She was President-elect. For real real, not for play play. Everything felt strange.<br/><br/>The crowd beyond the curtain was already roaring. They knew before she did, somehow. Maybe that’s what the internet was for. Or maybe they’d always known. Perhaps they always believed in something she’d been too battered to trust.<br/><br/>She walked to the podium on rather unsteady legs. The lights were blinding and the noise was incredibly overwhelming. Thousands of faces looked up at her — men and women, young and old, black and white, and many more.<br/><br/>“My fellow Americans,” she began, and her voice caught. <em>Ouch.</em> She cleared her throat and tried again. “My fellow Americans, we have made history tonight.”<br/><br/>The roar was almost deafening. She stood there, letting it wash over her, and letting it fill the hollow spaces that over sixteen years of public service had carved out. All the times she’d been told to step aside, to wait her turn, to smile more, to be less — hell, all the ways she’d been diminished, dissected, dismissed —, it all led to this. What a ride.<br/><br/>She thought of Arkansas, of being the governor’s wife who wouldn’t take his name at first. She thought of the White House, of being the First Lady who dared to have opinions; a lot of them, too. She thought of the Senate, of having to prove herself over and over again. She thought of 2008, of coming so close the first time only to watch it slip away.<br/><br/>But tonight, ha. Tonight was different.<br/><br/>“This summer,” she continued, finding her rhythm now, “a writer asked me: If I could go back in time and tell anyone in history about this milestone, who would it be? And the answer was easy: my mother, Dorothy.”<br/><br/><i>Oh, mother.</i><br/><br/>“You may have heard me talk about her difficult childhood. She was abandoned by her parents when she was just 8 years old. They put her on a train to California, where she was mistreated by her grandparents and ended up out on her own, working as a housemaid. Yet she still found a way to offer me the boundless love and support she never received herself.”<br/><br/>Hillary’s voice was more steady now, but her heart was racing. The more she thought about it, the more it started pumping. It was as if she could feel the weight of every woman who had been told no, every girl who had been told to lower her voice, and every person who had been made to feel small. It was revealing.<br/><br/>“She taught me the words of our Methodist faith: ’Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.’”<br/><br/>The crowd was quieter now, listening. She could feel them leaning in. The moment was pretty much crystallizing around them all.<br/><br/>“I think about my mother every day. Sometimes, I think about her on that train. I wish I could walk down the aisle and find the little wooden seats where she sat, holding tight to her even-younger sister, alone, terrified. She doesn’t yet know how much she will suffer. She doesn’t yet know she will find the strength to escape that suffering — that is still a long way off. The whole future is still unknown as she stares out at the vast country moving past her.”<br/><br/>She paused. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears and, for a moment, she thought she would break down there. <i>N-no</i>. “I dream of going up to her, and sitting down next to her, taking her in my arms and saying: look at me, listen to me. You will survive. You will have a good family of your own, and three children. And as hard as it might be to imagine, your daughter will grow up and become the president of the United States.”<br/><br/>And then it all erupted. God, it felt like thunder. It may’ve very well been actual thunder. Well, kind of like breaking glass. Shattering it — haha, get it? — and every barrier that had ever existed at once.<br/><br/>“I am as sure of this as anything I have ever known,” Hillary shouted over the noise, trying her best to keep her voice strong and clear, “America is the greatest country in the world. And from tonight, going forward, together we will make America even greater than it has ever been — for <i>each and every one of us</i>.”<br/><br/>It was over. Confetti began to fall, thousands and thousands of pieces of carefully-crafted glass-like material floating down from the ceiling above, each one catching the light from the stage. The applause she was receiving now was so loud that she almost wanted to ask them to stop. It was really over.<br/><br/>Hillary stood there in the center of it all, watching it cascade around her, and for a moment she couldn’t see anything. Not the crowd, not the cameras, not the many people just a few feet behind her on stage, and not even the future that stretched out before her.<br/><br/>She smiled. It was a real smile, too, and not the practiced one she’d worn through a thousand campaign events. She laid her head down on the podium in front of her, feeling the cool wood against her forehead, and for the first time in longer than she could remember, she cried.<br/><br/>Not from sadness or exhaustion or the weight of what was to come, no. But from something simpler, something she’d almost forgotten how to feel.<br/><br/>Relief… joy… or well, the knowledge that she was enough. That she had always been enough.

It was like a cathedral built to house a coronation, Bill once told me. But ambition, I learned that night, has a curfew. Ours was 2 a.m. The networks were still calling it a razor’s edge, and the union guys, who were far less patient than the rest of us, started rolling up the carpets. You can definitely rent the future, but only by the hour. That’s a detail they don’t teach you in civics class and that I should’ve recalled that night.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">The numbers coming in were a slow-motion car wreck. It was a cascade of bad news from places I really, really, <i>really</i> couldn’t afford to lose. Florida went south, in every sense of the word, Ohio followed it down the drain, and I watched as easily winnable Senate seats for our party swept away. The electoral map on the giant screens wasn’t just turning red; it was hemorrhaging. It felt as if I was staring at a crime scene photo where I was the primary suspect. It hurt.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">It’s a funny thing, politics. You spend a billion dollars to conquer the free world and you end up in a room with a minibar and a television bolted to the wall to keep honest people from stealing it. It reminds me of a quote from Vladimir Lenin, the former head of the Soviet Union. He once said “there are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.” Of course, what he didn’t know is that there were also hours where millennia happen. I saw it all that night. And so there we were, like a government-in-exile before we had even formed a government, decamping to a Midtown Hilton with none of the glamour we had seen earlier that day. Our victory party had become a wake, we’d kicked ourselves out of the funeral home, and the election wasn’t even over yet.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">The electoral map was a splash of red with islands of blue bleeding at the edges. That had been the case for a couple of elections now, although seeing the Obama coalition made me realize that, perhaps, this could stop being the case. And then people kept going to the Blue Wall. It wasn’t a wall. Maybe once it was, but not anymore. It was just a fence at this point, and there was a big, orange-haired wolf huffing and puffing at it and making surprising headway. I’d been in a lot of fights, but this one was different. This one I was supposed to win on points, and here I was, on the ropes, praying to hear a bell that could never ring.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">“We’re still breathing in Michigan,” Podesta kept telling me. “If we hold Pennsylvania…” He trailed off. I didn’t even bother listening to the rest. I was tired. Ultimately, these “ifs” were cheap chips in a game where the house was raking them all in.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">I’d had enough. To me, hope had become that last shot of whiskey in a glass; I knew it wouldn’t be enough, and I took it anyway out of habit, but I still wanted more. More and more and more and more. But it never came. I walked into the adjoining bedroom. The bed was a rather generic slab of foam that wasn’t very comfortable. I didn’t even bother with the covers, all I wanted for a moment was to pull the plug on the world and relax in the quiet darkness behind my own eyes. For a few hours, at least, I could be a civilian again. A former First Lady. A former Secretary of State. A Presidential candidate… a loser. It’s like there was a blind spot in my head, a bullet-shaped hole where the answers should be. One could call it denial. I’ve never been a detective, and I hardly had the answers to anything, but just like one, I wanted to dig inside my skull and scrape out the pain.</p><hr style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0"/><p style="text-indent: 2em;">I barely slept. The knock came in my door an hour or two later. Grey light was seeping through the curtains like smoke; my watch said it was a little after five. My aide, Huma stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the hallway light, looking like she’d just witnessed the end of the world. I prepared myself for it.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">“T-they called it,” she said. “It’s yours. It’s over.”</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">I sat up, and it felt like the room was spinning for a second from the sudden return to consciousness. “Over how?”</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">Something flickered across her face. It looked like a smile; I never wondered if it was meant to be one. “It’s over. You won.”</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">Her words didn’t land. They just hung there. <em>Madam President-elect.</em> Pfft. It didn’t click. I walked back into the other room, where the other talking heads in my campaign were screaming now. The map was finally filled in. I was over 270; I won. A lot closer than I had imagined, admittedly, and this kind of felt a lot like surviving a car crash.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">“Give me a moment,” I said to the room. Luckily, nobody argued. Power, even the kind that comes with a few bruises, commands a certain respect.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">The hotel bathroom had this harsh, fluorescent light that made me shiver. I stared at the mirror and realized I looked like hell warmed over. There was mascara smudged into dark crescents under my eyes, my lipstick had all but worn off, and my hair was out of place. Still, the makeup was good stuff — god bless waterproofing. A few splashes of cold water, a little repair work with what was left in my purse, and I started to recognize myself again.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">That woman. That woman in the mirror had climbed mountains before. She’d taken punches from better fighters than she had ever seen. And sure, she’d been counted out more times than a bad boxer, but here she was, still standing and still swinging. I straightened my shoulders and felt something click back into place; probably my actual shoulder.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">When I walked back out, the room had filled up. Staffers were appearing like crazy, and all of them were trying to look like they’d never doubted this moment would come. If I walked into a tree and shook it, at least thirty of them would fall down. Podesta was on three phones at once, and his voice was strong now that he had good news to peddle. The television was still babbling, but the sound had changed. It was the sound of victory.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">I looked out the window. The sun was coming up over Manhattan, painting the sky the color of a rather nice purple and gold and red. It was beautiful. Especially now that I’d won the whole damn thing. The glass ceiling was broken, all right, and now I just had to walk barefoot across the shards.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">This wasn’t the end of the fight. I realized it was just the start of a much harder one. But I’d been getting ready for hard fights my whole life, so I expected this. And after everything, from the emails to the investigations to the rallies to the debates… I was still here. </p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">The phone was ringing again. I assumed it was probably congratulations from people who’d written my obituary twelve hours ago — famously, the New York Times does a lot of that —, but I just let someone else answer it. I needed to, even if just for a few more minutes, stand in this cracked light and remember what winning felt like. It’s what I did. It felt… different. Especially when it comes to proving the bastards wrong.</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;">Outside, New York was waking up to a different world. But inside, I was getting ready to build it.</p><div style="margin-top: 3.5em; padding-top: 2em; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0; text-align: center; color: #5A768A; font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;"> snippet from "<em>What Happened Next: A Memoir of Breaking Through</em>"<br> Published by Simon & Schuster, 2018</div></div>`);

The White House has yet to issue official guidance on her title, with internal memos reportedly referring to her simply as “the Vice President’s partner.”</p> <p>Social conservatives are having a field day. “The Vice President’s residence is a symbol of the American family, not a co-ed dorm room,” said Mark Fields of the American Heritage Council in a blistering press release. The criticism has become a constant hum on conservative talk radio, but also on networks such as Fox News.</p> <p>More surprising, perhaps, is the consternation on the left. Dawson, who was a fiery surrogate for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primary, has found herself at the heart of the establishment she once railed against. “It’s jarring,” one former Sanders staffer told POLITICO. “Everyone thought she’d be pushing for a $15 minimum wage from inside the Naval Observatory, but it seems like she's just having fun?”</p> <p>The tension boiled over last month when Dawson went off-script at a charity gala, calling the administration’s position on charter schools “a little too cozy with Wall Street for my taste.” The comment, which directly contradicted remarks by the Education Secretary, sent the VP’s comms shop into a five-alarm fire drill. For a White House that values message discipline above all, perhaps an engagement might be the cleanest way to solve its Rosario problem.</p> </div> <div class="politico-tags-container"> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: #333;">This article tagged under:</span><br> <a href="#" class="politico-tag">White House</a> <a href="#" class="politico-tag">Hillary Clinton</a> <a href="#" class="politico-tag">Cory Booker</a> <a href="#" class="politico-tag">Rosario Dawson</a> <a href="#" class="politico-tag">Clinton Administration</a> </div> </div> </div>`);

    const VP_RATIONALES = {
        "Mike Pence": "Governor Mike Pence is the consensus choice to unite the party. He is a disciplined messenger who brings deep connections to social conservatives and the party establishment. With your campaign striking a relatively moderate tone so far, Trump’s team has likely opted for a VP who can reassure wavering Republicans and provide a steady, traditional counterpart to Trump’s volatile style.",
        "Chris Christie": "Governor Chris Christie’s selection is likely a nod to his reputation as a political brawler. Given your campaign’s aggressive posture so far, Trump has chosen a running mate who won’t hesitate to go on the attack. Christie was an early endorser of his, and this pick rewards that loyalty while adding a seasoned, if rather controversial, political fighter to the ticket.",
        "Newt Gingrich": "Newt Gingrich. This signals Trump intends to meet your aggressive campaign style with a scorched-earth strategy. Gingrich is a veteran political combatant who knows how to weaponize the media and attack relentlessly; he was Speaker of the House, after all. Just ask Bill how that went for him.",
        "Mike Flynn": "Michael Flynn is a pure base play. With your campaign running on an aggressive, populist platform, Trump is attempting to reinforce his own ’strongman’ image. Flynn, who’s a retired general, adds national security credentials — or, well, at least the appearance of them —, and helps energize his anti-establishment base that believes the system is rigged.",
        "Sarah Palin": "The selection of Sarah Palin seems to be a direct response to your campaign’s powerful populist appeal. Trump’s team is betting that the original anti-establishment icon can supercharge his base and counter your inroads with working-class voters. It’s a high-risk, high-reward move; you know how well it turned out for McCain. Thing is, you’re no Obama, for good or worse.",
        "Ted Cruz": "Senator Ted Cruz. A bit of an astonishing choice, given their primary battles. Your outreach to the Sanders wing of the party has likely spooked them; this move is probably an attempt to lock down the ideological conservative base, maybe fearing you might peel off working-class voters with a more populist message. We’ll see how that goes for them.",
        "Tom Cotton": "Senator Tom Cotton brings a hawkish, yet disciplined, voice to the ticket. Your populist messaging is clearly a concern for the Trump campaign, it seems. Cotton helps them shore up the conservative base on both economic and national security fronts, perhaps presenting a younger, more articulate version of Trump’s ’America First’ ideology.",
        "Jeff Sessions": "Senator Jeff Sessions was one of Trump’s earliest and most influential supporters in Washington. This pick is a reward for that loyalty, and a clear signal that Trump is doubling down on his hardline immigration and nationalist platform. With your campaign making populist appeals, Sessions’ goal is to keep the base energized around Trump’s core issues.",
        "Scott Brown": "Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts Senator, is a curious pick. Our analysis suggests that with your non-confrontational style, Trump’s campaign felt a need to moderate their ticket, although not necessarily their core issues. Brown is their attempt to appeal to swing voters and disillusioned independents who see Trump as too extreme. Keep an eye out for him.",
        "Bob Corker": "Senator Bob Corker is an establishment choice, plain and simple. Your less aggressive campaign style has given Trump an opening to appear more presidential, whatever that means. Corker is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and with his pick, Trump may hope to quell fears among Republicans and independents about his temperament and lack of foreign policy experience.",
        "Mary Fallin": "Governor Mary Fallin is a relatively safe, conventional pick. With your campaign running a more traditional race, Trump’s team clearly feels his populist base is secure. Fallin, a female governor, is a strategic choice aimed at softening Trump’s image and making a play for suburban women without alienating his core supporters."
