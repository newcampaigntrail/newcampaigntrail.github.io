Despite the natural advantages Bush had, and his aggressive negative campaigning against an ‘’east coast elitist’, you managed to keep the election close, or at least closer than it had appeared during the summer. Bush has been sent a firm message - it’s not just partisan anymore. The American people have serious issues with how he’s been governing this country. Still, Bush is not one to give up easily, and Rove has been telling him even a narrow mandate gives him a lot of room to maneuver.</p><p>The closeness of the race offers you a cold comfort while you call Bush to concede, with the whole affair taking long enough that Bush is forced to give his victory speech the following morning. You endure the continuing humiliation, as you deliver a sincere thank you speech towards your supporters and campaign team. Their hopes have been shattered by the loss, you know that. Worse still is the situation in Congress, where Republicans have picked five seats, mostly open seats held by Democrats in the south. The defeat of Democratic Leader Tom Daschle does come as a key prize, though.</p><p>If only you could wallow in self-pity forever. A new session of Congress will begin soon, and you still have a seat in the Senate, with four more years on your mandate to legislate and take action on the issues of the day. Bush still needs to be held accountable, and there's plenty of pickup opportunities in the Senate come 2006 and 2008 which could put the Democrats back into the majority. Plus, who knows who the candidates in 2008 will be? The frontrunner, of course, appears to be Hillary Clinton, but you might have a chance to run, and newly elected Senator Barack Obama seems to be making waves. Who knows if he's got a shot, though?</p>

Some say you were too liberal. Others say you weren’t liberal enough. Some say you were too soft on terrorism, others that you hadn’t denounced Bush’s illegal wars enough. If anyone will learn the answer, it will be you - you’ll repeat the campaign in your head over and over, trying to understand where it all went so wrong.

"The campaign was meant to be about the economy, about healthcare, and education, all of these failures Bush had. But since Kerry put me on defense after Iowa, it felt like we waged the campaign about Iraq. And I was always going to lose that."</p><p>For his part, Dean also mentions that he does not hold a grudge against Kerry. "I don't think his goal was to sabotage a general election campaign. He was just trying to win the primary, which he had a right to as a candidate and as a Senator. But it still mattered." Kerry, meanwhile, made a point to mend fences with Dean ahead of his failed 2008 campaign, and has been aware of how Dean felt for quite some time.</p><p>"Sometimes, though, you do have to wonder what things might've been like had the election gone differently. Clinton was a transformational President in many ways, but maybe we wouldn't have been able to break the glass ceiling had Bush lost?" Dean pondered. When asked about the 2020 field, Dean suggested that the time for a African-American President might be now, and that several candidates could accomplish that feat - such as Senate Minority Whip Barack Obama, Governor Marcia Fudge, or Senator Harold Ford Jr.</p>`)

The frontrunners for the Democrats definitely seems to be Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, but this one newcomer, a Senator from Illinois is also being talked about after a rousing speech at the convention.

All 50 Democrats and two Republican Senators - Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - voted in favor of moving the bill forward, while the other 48 members of the Republican caucus all voted against the motion.</p><p>It's a major defeat for the President, although the bill already had a tough journey to make it across the House of Representatives.

In a statement to the press, Dean vowed to "continue the fight" for healthcare reform, and invited Republican to a summit at the White House in the coming days to discuss bringing the bill back to life.</p><p>Senator John McCain, a maverick within his caucus, suggested that Dean reset the proposals and work with Republicans harder than his initial push.

"The campaign was meant to be about the economy, about healthcare, and education, all of these failures Bush had. But since Kerry put me on defense after Iowa, it felt like we waged the campaign about Iraq. And I was always going to lose that."</p><p>For his part, Dean also mentions that he does not hold a grudge against Kerry. "I don't think his goal was to sabotage a general election campaign. He was just trying to win the primary, which he had a right to as a candidate and as a Senator. But it still mattered." Kerry, meanwhile, made a point to mend fences with Dean ahead of his failed 2008 campaign, and has been aware of how Dean felt for quite some time.</p><p>"Sometimes, though, you do have to wonder what things might've been like had the election gone differently. Clinton was a transformational President in many ways, but maybe we wouldn't have been able to break the glass ceiling had Bush lost?" Dean pondered. When asked about the 2020 field, Dean suggested that the time for a African-American President might be now, and that several candidates could accomplish that feat - such as Senate Minority Whip Barack Obama, Governor Marcia Fudge, or Senator Harold Ford Jr.</p>`)
