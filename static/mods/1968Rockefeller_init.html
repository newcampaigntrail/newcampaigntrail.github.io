Rockefeller by Joseph E. Persico</a><h4>Comments and Credits</h4><p>Thank you for playing this mod! This was a project I picked up halfway through a much bigger one that I may or may not finish, just as a way to take my mind off said bigger project. I made this mod with the intention of trying to repudiate the myth of Rockefeller - that he was not the wholesome, liberal Republican people online make him out to be, but an idiosyncratic figure who, much of the time, did not have support from his own party, despite sticking to it his entire life. I also did not want to go too far in terms of negativity towards Rockefeller - he was not yet, at this time, the man responsible for the Rockefeller Drug Laws or the response towards Attica. I wanted to portray him as he really was, and I hope I made what I was going for clear, and my interpretation of him generally consistent with who he was as a person.</p><p>I would like to give thanks to neo/Intenew and Massachusetts for Stockdale/Stockdale for TCT, who generously agreed to playtest the mod for me. I appreciated their feedback greatly, and I can see why they're good collaborators many modders would want to work with.</p><p>For sources, I relied mainly on Smith and Persico, the two books I've linked in this section. I recognize that both of them have their own unique provenances - Persico, for example, was a speechwriter for Rockefeller. I've tried to take these provenances into account. I also used, especially for the running mates, general Internet sources, such as news articles or papers written by the candidates themselves.</p></font>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":4,"year":1968,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1968Rockefeller"}];e.credits = "Roniius";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":23,"fields":{"first_name":"Nelson A.","last_name":"Rockefeller","election":4,"party":"Republican","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":"<p>The Republican National Convention erupts - partially in cheers, and partially in half-hearted voices of discontent - upon Governor Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller taking the stage.

The standard-bearer for moderate Republicanism, Rockefeller has presided over one of the largest states in the country - New York - for two terms, and has just been re-elected to a third. Launching an up-hill challenge against former Vice President Richard M. Nixon and coming out victorious, Rockefeller has had to make countless major choices to win - a tentative alliance with the arch-conservative Ronald Reagan, a strong campaign in Oregon - but he has finally done it.
