In his time in the Senate, he’s become known as a centrist, moderate Republican who is sometimes characterized as fiscally conservative/responsible and socially liberal. With many swing states in this election located in the Northeast, picking Rudman would help you in that region, especially in states like Vermont and Maine, where Reagan did quite poorly four years ago. This comes at the cost of losses among evangelicals in the South who will be turned off by Rudman’s social liberalism, especially on issues like Abortion, and his opposition to a constitutional amendment mandating voluntary school prayer.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 225, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Victor\", \"last_name\": \"Atiyeh\", \"election\": 20, \"party\": \"Republican\", \"state\": \"Oregon\", \"priority\": 7, \"description\": \"'\", \"color_hex\": \"#FF0000\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#FFA0A0\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/YuYZxYz.jpg\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"'\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"'\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"'\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<p>Victor Atiyeh is the Governor of Oregon.

He then made a run for Governor in 74, Losing to incumbent Robert Straub before challenging him once more in 78, this time winning. Atiyeh became the first Arab American Governor in the history of the United States. Atiyeh has governed as surprisingly fiscally liberal while seemingly keeping a low profile on social issues. Some of his main focuses as Governor have been free trade, Worker's compensation, and solving economic and budget problems.
