Helle Thorning has repeated the impossible, not leading the largest party but still having the Queen’s grace to form a government. You have shocked the entire political sphere by overcoming them, but your deadweight in Lars Løkke and the others in the Blue Bloc have dragged you down to opposition. Venstre’s supporters are outraged, demanding Løkke step down immediatly while you have managed to usurp the role of main opposition to the Red Bloc.</p><p>Venstre will rot while Dansk Folkeparti becomes the vanguard for the Danish right, seeking to challenge Helle Thorning’s weak and unstable government in the hopes of the next election giving you the ability to finally obtain your part in government. If Venstre fails to manage itself sufficiently, you will easily be able to become a major Prime Minister candidate, and finally reform the Venstre-Socialdemokratiet duopoly into one that listens to its rural citizens, one that listens to its poor and scared who are afraid of crime, lawless migration and cuts to the welfare state. But those are dreams of the future. For now Kristian, the party needs to be united and to be stronger than ever. Because while your achievement is monumental, there is so much more that can be done.</p>`]

Helle Thorning has announced at her party meeting that she has resigned from party leader, but due to prior bloc agreements, Lars Løkke will return as the Prime Minister. However, if you can compromise with him, DF can stuff obtain many important cabinet posts and finally conduct politics for the forgotten people.</p><p>You reflect back on your short period as a MP for Fremskridtspartiet, and the dreams you and Pia Kjærsgaard’s had with your small splinter faction. How you went from a small breakaway to the political centerpiece of an election 2 decades later, which replicated the success Mogens Glistrup achieved in the groundbreaking 1973 election. Political analysts have already begun taking notes on the steps you've made to your great success, as Eurocrats and establishmentarians shake in their boots at DF’s victory. While negotiations with Lars Løkke over the new government loom over you due to your multitude of disagreements, at least you can enjoy this moment in all of Europe’s spotlight.

Because while you did overcome Venstre and have taken over Blue Bloc, your rule will be of not much importance until the next elections due to Lars Løkke’s greater national profile. Party members say that you have done a good job, but they know deep-down that this was not enough.</p><p>However, not all is lost. You have successfully demonstrated that DF is capable of leading an extremely effective national campaign, and you have spread the message of a forgotten country. Helle Thorning has promised to look over healthcare, education and immigration reform, pushed by you and your fiery rhetoric. And maybe you can use all that campaigning experience to bring DF into a lot more municipal seats in 2017. However, watch out for splinters on the right wing of Dansk Folkeparti.

You, Kristian, knew that more was possible than to be forever stuck behind Lars Løkke’s shadow.</p><p>For what is the point of a rural rebellion if you remain chained and subservient to Ozymandias? With all your disagreements, Løkke will most likely just go straight to Anders Samuelsen’s LA for a government, while you have to maintain a weak position of confidence and supply. Most members of DF are satisfied with the result, but others desperately want more. A fringe of members demands even further radicalism, shifting away from our ideal of defending the welfare state to an ultraliberal right-wing populism, one reminiscent of your original political home, Fremskridtspartiet.

Your willingness to argue with Løkke on every issue possible has been blamed for losing Blue Bloc the election, and the hope for DF in the upcoming 2017 municipal elections looks grim. Splinter groups and new right-wing populist movements are already beginning to form to challenge DF’s rule, and the future of the party looks uncertain. You could either lead this sinking ship until it has fully submerged, or just resign, finish an MBA and get a new job as an administrator.
