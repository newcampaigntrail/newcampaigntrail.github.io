Journalists and politicos who crudely dismissed his protest at the RNC as a “stunt” are suddenly caught on the backheel. Perhaps, these are the tactics that resonate with Americans. You hear rumors about secret meetings between Kovic and Democratic strategists and a coming recalibration of the party’s platform. Similar successes have followed you. Almost all your critics within the party have been silenced and, for the first time in your life, your opinion is being actively sought by journalists and activists alike. Buoyed by its electoral success, CPUSA has experienced a surge in recruitment that has your Soviet handlers surprised.</p><p>You look out the window at the wintery city streets. Blanketed as they are by the snow, you see no ads, no campaign posters, nothing at all. All the world seems blank, brand new. It looks like a world waiting to be remade and, if you’re lucky enough, perhaps you’ll have a part to play in doing that.</p>`]

On the back is a laminated photo of the White House’s North Lawn, roses blooming in the foreground around a circular fountain. You move to toss the card in your trash and then think better of it.</p><p>Are you living an inadequate life? You’re not sure. As you expected, there were no grand demonstrations of support on Election Day. It came and went with Nixon, predictably, winning the presidency. In the weeks that it took the various states to count their totals, it became clear that the CPUSA had, indeed, multiplied its votes by a substantial margin. It just isn’t clear whether that success is because of something you did or the unprecedented nature of this race, which saw a small, passionate minority desperate for any alternative at all to the crooked Nixon and the hapless Connally.</p>`,
     `<p>For your running mate, Ron Kovic, the result is little more than a footnote for his continued activism. He never talks to you again. You hear he and a few other veterans secured a meeting with the head of the Veterans Administration and a few congressmen to demand better treatment for returning soldiers, but you have no further insights into his career. Maybe you’ll wake up one day to discover he’s joined the Democrats. For your part, your campaign has changed remarkably little. There are still those that grumble about your leadership, either because you’re too revisionist or not enough, but the results have pacified your worst critics. You can expect few serious threats to your position and will almost certainly be nominated again in 1976.</p><p>You stare at the postcard for a long while before tacking it gently into the wall behind your desk. The message sits framed between a photo of you and your grandchildren at Coney Island and a photo of you and Morris Childs standing in Red Square. It’s a small, daily reminder. A warning. A threat.</p>`]

This country, this awful country, has not merely ignored your call for revolutionary liberation, it has firmly rejected it. Millions of Americans saw what you and your running mate offered and found you both lacking. New left and old left alike saw you as disappointments, failures. They would sooner vote for crooks like Nixon or Connally than you. They would sooner vote for FBI-backed rubes like Linda  Jenness.</p>`,
   `<p>And what now? For your running mate, Ron Kovic, this result is a dismal signal about the future of the anti-war movement. He feels dejected and demoralized that you let you talk him into this ticket and believes that it has, perhaps permanently, reduced the movement’s appeal. Amid conservatives denouncing all anti-war activists as “communists and traitors,” he disappears. For you, though, you will have to remain behind to clean up the mess. After getting the party’s hopes up of a ‘historically significant showing,’ there is anger and fury. Countless party members are already stepping up to condemn you and push for your removal from party leadership.</p><p>Leaving the party headquarters one night, you see ‘NIXON NOW’ pasted over a faded campaign poster and shake your head.

 e.pages = [`<p>You think this to yourself as you sit alone in the ruin of the day, your head in your hands. The January night is cold. Your fingers are numb. If there is any light and joy left in the world, it is far away from your bench in Central Park. All you have now is desolation, ruin. The earth could crack open and swallow you whole and not a single person would care.</p>`,
 `<p>What happened? Are you and your running mate truly so loathsome? Are you so hated that not even 50,000 Americans could stomach the idea of writing you in as a statement, as a protest vote, as a joke? In the face of obvious criminality by Nixon, a blundering campaign by Connally, and historic nationwide unrest, how did you manage to so totally alienate every segment of the modern Left? You try to wrack your brain for answers but none emerge. Perhaps it’s that very failure of imagination that is responsible for your results.</p>`,
 `<p>Or maybe it was your running mate, Ron Kovic, a liberal’s idea of a revolutionary, a man more enamored with political stunts than building worker consciousness. He’s been quiet since Election Day, though you suspect that’s only because he views this entire race as a blight on his career. No congressman wants to be caught dead in a room with him. Even those in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War have asked him to not participate in their events. It’s unclear what he’ll do now with his sad and empty life, a soldier abandoned by his allies.</p>`,
 `<p>For you, your career as CPUSA leader is over. There will be a vote, you know, but at this point the procedure is only a formality. Your failed promises of a communist resurgence combined with your ham-fisted statements on the campaign trail have alienated everyone. You suspect that even your Soviet handlers are trying to push you out, seeing you as too damaged to have any real value. What happens to you after this inevitability is anyone’s guess. Your communist roots will preclude you from any real future career.</p>`,
 `<p>You do not get up from the park bench. You do not move. You sit there until the lamp post above you suddenly burns out and you vanish into the darkness of the night.</p>`]
