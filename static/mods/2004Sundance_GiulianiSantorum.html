What is your response?"], [347, "During the primary campaign, you repeatedly criticized President Gore for the state of the economy, blaming him for the \"dot&#8209;com\" crash and the resulting recession. What will be the main focus of your economic messaging in the general election?"], [344, "The primary campaign was an ugly affair, and attacks from candidates like Trent Lott and Joe Scarborough over your personal life and past positions still hold sway with much of the Republican base. How will you bring right-wing voters back around?"], [345, "Abortion has dogged your campaign since its inception. You faced plenty of flack over your \"pro-abortion\" track record during the primaries, while the Democrats revel in the opportunity to call you a flip-flopper. How will you thread the needle?"], [349, "The internet is a rapidly emerging medium for political activism; a recent survey shows nearly 3-in-10 voters under 30 get their campaign news online, and multiple of your primary opponents leveraged the \"netroots\" to gain momentum.<br>What will your online outreach look like?"]]
// Second block of questions
q_list1 = [[346, "While the issue has diminished in importance since September 11th, President Gore has passed many of his environmental initiatives, such as the Boxer-Dingell Act. He now proposes limits on oil drilling. What do you think about all this?"], [388, "Gay marriage is a hot button issue, and your position on it is a pain point with social conservatives; your support of same-sex civil unions as mayor faced heavy attacks during the primaries. What is your actual stance on gay marriage?"], [374, "During your campaign, you've laid out plans for an expanded \"War on Terror\" that you would pursue if elected president: another troop surge in Afghanistan to hold the fort down, and a stronger stance against Saddam Hussein in Iraq.<br>How will you talk about counter-terrorism on the trail?"], [362, "Many pundits and media figures have hounded you over the years about your personal life; this campaign is no different, as they renew their focus on your recent second divorce. Is there any way you want to finally put this mess to bed?"], [365, "Nearly 3 in 10 Americans say they have been unable to afford medical care at some point since 2003. Al Gore responded with the Patient's Bill of Rights&nbsp;--&nbsp;which you and other Republicans oppose&nbsp;--&nbsp;but what does your own healthcare plan look like?"], [359, "So far, you've remained fairly moot on education&nbsp;--&nbsp;your record on education as mayor was one of failure, and Gore's \"No Child Left Behind\" package remains popular. Will your attitude on education change in the general election?"]]
// 2 questions that *will* appear in undefined order
q_list2 = [[358, "How will you approach the upcoming series of three televised debates? They will afford you a rare chance to directly confront Al Gore on the political and personal issues that have persisted through this campaign."], [372, "Unlike your domestic approval, your support globally hasn't wavered. You're still beloved from Tokyo to Rio de Janeiro, and it's considered one of your biggest assets politically.<br>Where would you like to take a brief foreign trip before the tail end of the campaign?"]]
// Final block of questions
q_list3 = [[355, "As the Assault Weapons Ban expires, gun control has re-emerged as an issue&nbsp;--&nbsp;one where you've pivoted hard in recent years. Your previous support of the ban caused major controversy during the primaries. What is your current stance on gun control?"], [364, "The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> published a report today uncovering various Gore administration grants authorized to fund solar and wind farms in Afghanistan through the Boxer-Dingell Act.<br>This has come under heavy scrutiny from the right. Do you have anything to add?"], [389, "Afghan officials have informally agreed to protect local opium fields, mainly out of fear of angering locals by destroying their crops. This policy has faced heavy criticism and scrutiny since it was uncovered&nbsp;--&nbsp;would you like to add on to the discussion?"], [352, "Russian president Vladimir Putin publicly called out Al Gore for staying his hand in the Chechnya campaign after terrorists overtook an elementary school in the town of Beslan, killing 100 innocent parents and children.<br>Putin's claims about Al-Qaeda activity in the area have spread like wildfire. Do you agree with his statements?"], [384, "Although it hasn't been central to the campaign, Republicans have tried to push immigration into the discussion, hoping to use it as a \"wedge issue\" against President Gore. During the primaries, your plan was frequently decried as a form of amnesty by your challengers. What will you say about immigration policy?"], [381, "Last year, you tepidly supported President Gore's Muslim-American hate crime legislation, despite speaking out against some provisions as recently as last spring. With your allies in the media attacking the law, will you bring it up as well?"], [1003, "The Gore administration has been reluctant to build a national missile defense system, claiming it would be impossible to build, and that doing so would involve scrapping the ABM Treaty with Russia. What would you do about missile defense if elected?"], [1004, "With national morale down after the September 11th attacks, you recently proposed to make America \"think big again\" by sending astronauts to the surface of Mars by 2014. Why did you make that pledge?"]]
// 2 questions that *will* appear in undefined order
q_list4 = [[1001, "\"9/11 First Responders for Truth,\" a liberal outside group, is airing ads in several swing states accusing you of abandoning Ground Zero first responders still ailing from health issues, and poorly preparing New York for an attack.<br>These ads are really stirring a fuss on cable news; how will you defend yourself?"], [1002, "Recently, internet sleuths have resurfaced comments published by Allentown's <i>Morning Call</i> newspaper, in which Senator Santorum claimed gay marriage was an issue \"brought on us\" like 9/11. These remarks have entered mainstream discussion, fueling a growing debate about your running mate's history of gaffes. What will you do about this?"]]
