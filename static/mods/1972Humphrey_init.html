The Vietnam War, still ongoing, has been cut down by the Nixon administration through Vietnamization, but has also been expanded to Cambodia. Overtures have been made to the Communist world through Nixon's visit to China. Yet within the country itself, social issues still abound - students, black and women voters have coalesced into a strong movement.

White - The Making of the President 1972</a><h4>Comments</h4><p>This is the first mod I started, but the second to be released. I think that's kind of funny. The lack of experience in coding, I'm sure, shows to a lot of more experienced modders. I'm generally satisfied with the Harris and Mondale running mates at this point, but I'm not sure if I'll actually finish Wallace as a running mate - I've got a lot to do, and working on a mod for a browser game is pretty far down my list.<br><br>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this mod. I used a lot of quotes in it from Offner, and had to extrapolate a bit from White and from the 1968 election. I don't know if I really accurately captured Humphrey's political change from 1968 to 1972, and I don't claim to know too much about him - just enough to get this done. I did enjoy reading about Humphrey, Harris, and Mondale, and some bizarre facts and quotes related to Humphrey. For researching the running mates and extra information about Humphrey's own opinions, I found HeinOnline incredibly useful - there are a lot of papers on there written by the political figures themselves, outlining their views. I took some direct quotes from there, too.</p>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":4,"year":1968,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1972Humphrey"}];e.credits = "Roniius";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":30,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":24,"fields":{"first_name":"Hubert","last_name":"Humphrey","election":4,"party":"Democratic","state":"Minnesota","priority":1,"description":"Former Vice President Hubert Horatio Humphrey, battered from his close loss in 1968, has returned triumphant, first back to the Senate, then to the nomination. The definition of the establishment in the Democratic Party, Humphrey is a reassuring candidate in the face of radicals like George McGovern, and has, since 1968, moved somewhat to the right. In a contentious primary marked by huge shakeups in the party, Humphrey narrowly bested McGovern, whose performances in key primaries like California struck fear into the ranks of the Humphrey Campaign.<br><br>But now he has pulled it off, and is on track to his rematch with Nixon. The growing movement in the party of the disenchanted left, created through challengers in the 1968 nomination and amplified by McGovern, seems to not be so happy with Humphrey. Still, too, Humphrey is cursed by his 1968 position on Vietnam. Nixon will also be hard to beat, and Humphrey needs to secure enough of the anti-Nixon vote to at least give him a challenge like he did in 1968.","color_hex":"#3158ce","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/cEfEV8X.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>Return of the Happy Warrior</h3><br><br>You’ve won, Mr. Humphrey.
