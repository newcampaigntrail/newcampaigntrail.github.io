Gou's campaign encountered numerous issues over the months, ultimately leading to the current outcome. Firstly, Gou's involvement in past scandals resurfaced, severely impacting his and the KMT's image. Many within the KMT were also dissatisfied with the influence he had on the party in 2019, including a considerable number of Han Kuo-yu's supporters, as he competed against Han in 2019 and played a role in his significant defeat.</p><p>Mayor Hou You-yi focused on municipal governance and did not actively support Gou's campaign, lacking the backing of the initially popular presidential candidate Hou You-yi. Gou's campaign suffered from a lack of enthusiasm and support.</p><p>Things took a turn for the worse when Ko Wen-je refused to form a KMT-TPP ticket with Gou. Ko was wary of Gou's extensive business background and unclear ties with Beijing, as Gou had substantial business interests in mainland China. Gou insisted on running for president instead of vice president, refused to let the outcome be decided by polls, and even made statements like 'Let the Older brother go first for four years.' By November 23, Ko Wen-je still refused to communicate with Gou. At this point, Gou's approval ratings had fallen to the level of Eric Chu in 2016, and he still had not found a vice president. Ultimately, on November 24, Hung Hsiu-chu, who had been nominated in 2016 before being abolished, became Gou's vice president in an attempt to salvage his candidacy and keep the KMT in the election. Unfortunately, these efforts were in vain, and Gou's defeat was a reality.</p><p>With Gou's defeat, you have one less opponent to deal with in the next four years. Despite achieving high satisfaction ratings in polls for excellent municipal governance, earning the title of 'Five-Star Mayor,' it came at the cost of the KMT's survival and development. After this election, the KMT's electoral capabilities have once again been undermined. How many years will it take for this party to emerge from the shadow of 2016? Perhaps it will never happen.</p></div>"

Gou gradually gained a stable lead over Lai. However, the rise of Ko Wen-je and the TPP caused a decline in Gou's approval ratings. Gou had to consider the KMT-TPP Tickets, and after sporadic negotiations over several months, a decision was made on November 15 to determine the outcome through polls.

Gou nominated political outsider Lai Pei-hsia as vice president, bringing a positive media image. In the vice presidential debate, her unique eloquence, speaking skills, and sincere words resonated with many voters.

He emphasizes the importance of a united Taiwan rather than one divided by conflicts. He notes that Taiwan must address issues related to security in the Taiwan Strait and the relationship between the United States, China, and Taiwan. He hopes the DPP will listen to the people's expectations, building a clean, capable, and efficient government.</p><p>Mayor Hou You-yi also urges turning the power of sorrow and disappointment into a force for supervising the DPP.

After the election, his Facebook was turned upside down by angry opposition voters.</p><p>Although Lai Ching-te becomes president, his governance won't be smooth.

This means that, barring any surprises, Han Kuo-yu, who supports you, will become the president of the Legislative Yuan. This is a significant payback for him. Zhao Shao-kang can go back to hosting his show, and you can go back to being the mayor of New Taipei City. You can try running again in 2028, as your performance has at least matched that of Han Kuo-yu in 2020, and this was in a three-way race.

Mayor Hou delivered his concession speech around 8 p.m., expressing regret for not achieving a party change. He respects the final choice made by the people of Taiwan and congratulates the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Lai Ching-te and Hsiao Bi-Khim, on their victory. Mayor Hou urges everyone to transform the power of sorrow and disappointment into a force for supervising the DPP. He emphasizes that, starting tomorrow, they will roll up their sleeves and work hard, not letting down the expectations of their supporters and dedicating themselves more earnestly to the country.</p><p>Mayor Hou's face appears solemn, and at the beginning of his speech, he expresses gratitude to the supporters present, the people watching on television, and friends on the internet.

The DPP has achieved an unprecedented third term, even though their government is a minority one without the support of the majority of the people.

Before the election, he had significant momentum, with substantial support from young people and a large voice among internet users, especially TPP supporters. However, these were ultimately futile dreams. Even if Ko Wen-je said he would let you run alone, you wouldn't have won. You proved that the KMT, with a solid base, wouldn't easily lose to the TPP, which has only been around for a few years.

For most of the past year, Lai Ching-te had been leading in the polls, only recently trading victories with Hou You-yi in the last couple of months. In the audience, there were infants in cradles, elderly individuals in their seventies and eighties, and middle-aged people in their forties and fifties, all hoping for a KMT victory to bring them a better future. When the vote counting began, Hou You-yi and Lai Ching-te were neck and neck. However, people noticed that Hou You-yi had a significantly high vote share in deep-blue regions. In battleground areas like Changhua and Taichung, he also performed admirably, gradually widening the gap. In the end, Hou You-yi secured victory in the presidential election with over 46% of the votes, becoming the 16th president.</p><p>Zhao Shao-kang immediately shouted 'Long live the Republic of China' three times at the scene. You and your campaign team quickly conducted a simulated inauguration ceremony, preparing for the formal inauguration on May 20. Zhao Shao-kang was delighted to become the vice president and pledged to donate all his salary, converting the vice president's residence into social housing for young people through a lottery system. The DPP suffered a major defeat in this election, prompting them to reflect on whether their governance over the past eight years had left the people extremely dissatisfied, leading them to choose the strongest candidate even in the face of opposition division, ultimately ousting the DPP. Lai Ching-te's days as vice president were also coming to an end.</p><p>As the president who led the KMT back to power and won a challenging battle, the rewards for you are substantial. The KMT holds 59+2 seats in the Legislative Yuan, becoming the largest party and securing an absolute majority in the legislature. Han Kuo-yu, who supports you, is destined to become the president of the Legislative Yuan, and party chairman Eric Chu can become the premier. According to tradition, the party chairman should be the president, a significant reward for You. Zhao Shao-kang, as vice president, can handle diplomatic affairs and even represent you on foreign visits. Due to the enormous victory you achieved this year, it's almost certain that you will be nominated for re-election by the KMT in 2028. However, the upcoming New Taipei City mayoral by-election and the 2026 county and city mayoral elections will test your governing abilities. If you can navigate them successfully, then you have a great chance of winning re-election in 2028. Good luck, President Hou You-yi!</p></div>"

However, on January 13th, how did things take such a turn? Lai Ching-te has emerged victorious over you, reminiscent of 2004 when the KMT's poll numbers remained high but were caught up and surpassed in the final stages.

This is not good news for the KMT, and the TPP might consider choosing to cooperate with the DPP because your failure has brought about bitter political consequences.

Their election staff used various methods, including disabling cameras, not singing the ballots, and much more. Our TPP and KMT supervisors have discovered many flaws in the electoral process, suspected of cheating... Please, everyone, look at the big screen.'</p><p>Hou You-yi added, 'The gap in our defeat is... very, very marginal. This slight difference is clouded in suspicion, raising many doubts. It gives the impression that this is an unfair election. We are preparing to file a lawsuit for the invalidation of the election.'</p><p>Supporters: 'Invalid! Invalid! Invalid!'</p><p>As the chants subsided, Hou You-yi continued, 'The second request is for the CEC to immediately seal all ballot boxes as a basis for future verification.'</p><p>Supporters: 'Verify! Verify! Verify!'</p><p>'If Taiwan really cannot lose, it's here. Everyone, right?'</p><p>Supporters: 'Yes!'</p><p>'Taiwanese people, democracy is our most effective weapon against the CCP. When we destroy this weapon, what other defenses do we have? Unfair elections not only make us hear about the doubts just mentioned but also clearly witness manipulative actions throughout the election. Everyone knows this, and we are using the most rational and gentle method to expose the deception carried out by Lai Ching-te and the DPP throughout this election. Let the whole world understand, shall we?'</p><p>Supporters: 'Go Hou-Ko! Go Hou-Ko!'</p><p>What happened in the world was unclear, but it was certain that Taiwan would once again enter bitter days of election violence and confrontation.</p></div>"

KMT Secures Election with Over 50% of the Vote</h3><p>When Terry Gou didn't support you after the primaries, you felt defeated. As dissatisfaction among Han's supporters led to a decline in your polls, the period from May to October was a tough battle for both you and the KMT. The fluctuating polls made your fight very difficult, but ultimately, in October and November, due to Han Kuo-yu's endorsement and your early efforts, Ko Wen-je yielded in the final integration process, making you the presidential candidate. Almost all polls showed that after the coalition, you would be consistently leading Lai Ching-te by 5% in support, meaning a gap of several hundred thousand to a million votes. On January 13th, during the vote count program, people were surprised to find that the gap between Lai Ching-te and Hou You-yi's votes wasn't as large as imagined. Lai Ching-te even maintained a lead at one point, causing many to worry about the complete destruction and failure that cooperation between the two parties might lead to. Fortunately, due to your high voter turnout and support rates in some deep blue areas, as well as the suppression of Lai Ching-te in major swing areas, you secured the presidency, but only by a few percentage points. The 8-year DPP rule ended in your hands, and Mayor Hou You-yi will be recorded in the history of the Republic of China as the president who led the KMT back to power. This is a significant achievement!</p><p>Due to your strong performance in the general election, the KMT became the largest party in the Legislative Yuan, while the DPP lost over a dozen seats, resulting in KMT having 56+2 legislators, ensuring you a precarious absolute majority for the next four years. Although fragile, at least your bills won't be arbitrarily blocked by the opposition, laying a solid foundation for your future governance. Han Kuo-yu will undoubtedly become the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, as the KMT is the largest party in parliament and now has an absolute majority. What you need to worry about now is the by-election in New Taipei City and the county and city mayor elections in 2026. If you can not only hold onto your current local governance but also expand into deep green areas, it will ensure your re-election in 2028. You're likely to be re-elected again, governing until 2032. However, Ko Wen-je is always an unpredictable factor. Hopefully, he won't oppose you and your government at that time. If all goes well, you're likely to be re-elected again, governing until 2032.
