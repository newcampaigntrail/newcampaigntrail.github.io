    e.pages.push(`<p>(...)<br><br>WALTER DEVRIES: How would you characterize that following? What do they believe? Have their beliefs changed?<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: Well...<br><br>WALTER DEVRIES: You say you represent a certain segment. What do they believe?<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: I think they represent the majority viewpoint in the country. I think people have grown tired of big government. I feel that they feel that government has been pretty much aloof from them. I think they felt that about the Democratic Party in 1972... was just aloof from them. Was just foreign to them. They couldn't relate to it at all. So many things happen to them that they are opposed to. And I don't like to bring up busing because that's not the biggest issue or the only issue. It's a big issue in different places. But when Gallup polls show that 75-80% of the people of both races oppose this particular sort of school maneuver yet it's still forced on the people. They wonder why is it we always have to do what we don't want to do. Is it because a certain few in the country? Do we have an elitist government that a few in the bureaucracy which is stronger, as I said, than the government itself.<br><br>Stronger than the president and stronger than the Congress. They've decreed that it's good for the people to do certain things. And even though the people don't like to do it, they must do it because this super elite group is so determined. I think that's the way they feel. And they feel that the government's aloof. They've found the Democratic Party in '72 adopting a platform that they did not relate with. The great middle class of our country that today is being probably subjected to the most abuse in the tax system of any group in the country. And if you ever destroy the middle class, I think you destroy the group that defends your system and supports the system and holds the system together. And I think they're all recognizing that. Didn't you hear them all talk that way the other day to the Democratic chairman? Same thing I used to talk about. So I think that I represent a broad spectrum of people. In fact it turned out in the governor's race that I represented a pretty broad spectrum of people of all races in this state.<br><br>WALTER DEVRIES: Is that how you explain your continued popularity in this state? I mean you've been around now since 1958. You've been in office since 1962. How do you explain your own hold?<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: I believe one reason . . . people have been satisfied with the things we do in state government. They're very satisfied. Not completely satisfied. I don't think there's any way to completely satisfy everybody and have a utopia. But I think they've been pretty, generally appreciative of the feeling that this government has had for the great mass of our people.<br><br>(...)</p>`, `<p>WALTER DEVRIES: Is it their identity with you that gives you the strength? If you look at the other southern states, there's been no politician that has lasted as long in the executive office as you have. Right?<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: That's right.<br><br>WALTER DEVRIES: How do you explain that? Because in all the other states this has not happened. But in Alabama it does happen.<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: Well, I cannot explain... I can't tell you about other governors or other people. You do know that governors have a hard time being reelected. Or at least beyond a four-year... maybe two two-year terms. You can go to the Senate and the House and it's been a custom in our part of the country because of the seniority system that people have stayed there longer. And they've understood that and that's not difficult to do. But in the executive office it is difficult to do. I think that I've explained it to you in talking about not only the projects and progress we've made in our own state but the fact that they've been represented and they appreciated the fact that you stood in Madison Square Garden and told them you came from a great state. And have the people to stand up and give you a standing ovation. Let them know that even though the newspapers have been writing and making fun of them, the people in New York like them, and knew they were good folks. Were not what they were said to be. You know.<br><br>WALTER DEVRIES: You're saying you really haven't lost touch with that group and they still identify with you. That for other politicians, they have lost touch and people don't identify with them any more?<br><br>GEORGE WALLACE: Many of them. But have you noticed in the last few years how many of them are swinging back to saying exactly what we say? Don't you hear people running for the mayorship of Los Angeles and Atlanta, both races, saying we must have law and order, and if you'll elect me, I'll make it safe to walk on the streets. But when I was raising that issue in '68, they called it something evil. Said it was demagogic. And now... when I talked about the urban welfare mess in '68, Humphrey called it demagogic. For instance. And yet the first thing he said in '72 in Florida was he wanted to get the welfare chiselers and loafers off the welfare rolls. And on the matter of busing. You find the busing bills have been introduced by people like senators from Michigan and people from the state of New York, not Alabama.</p>`);

Later, as the Civil Rights Act of '64 came into effect, President Lyndon Baines Johnson paid quite a large interest into making sure this state in the deepest reach of the deep south was a model for the rest to follow.<br><br>As such, while the first part of his governorship showed him completely unable to do much of anything, the legislative block being so great he couldn't even organize road renovation, the second part of it had a lot more success, allowing him enough support to illegally run for governor again in 1966, expecting the Supreme Court of Alabama to accept the "fais accomplis" after seeing how ineffectual that had been until now.<br><br>Tragically, ‘Black Hand’ DeGraffenried would die in a plane crash while campaigning, leaving his sometime rival, longtime friend Folsom to succeed him as an integrationist Democrat.
