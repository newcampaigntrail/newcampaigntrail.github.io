The Republicans faired no better in what was thought to be an easy nomination of former Vice President Richard Nixon that turned into a close primary race that ended with New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller winning the nomination. A three-way race ensued that was nearly deadlocked by Governor George Wallace of Alabama. However, Rockefeller barely eked out an electoral majority because he kept New York and California in his column. </li><li>Now, 1972 brings a new struggle, a much more personal struggle for the president. President Rockefeller can't tiptoe anymore. It takes decisive action to be president. He must stake himself out as either a liberal or a conservative. Voters won't elect the same man who almost squandered his bid in 68.</li> ",
