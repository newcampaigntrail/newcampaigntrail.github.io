It appears that the inexorable march of scientific socialism shall soon eclipse all other factions, ascending to the zenith of influence within the realm of socialist politics. Proudhon and his followers must surely be laughing right now.<p></p>Still, amidst the tumult, you maintain a formidable amount of influence within the Indiana Democratic Party.
