Cruz is a Hispanic-American freshman conservative Texas Senator. Clinton has served as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. Clinton was the presumptive nominee from start to finish, while Cruz had to get through a heated primary which included Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even real estate mogul Donald Trump.<br><br>Both candidates are going to face a lot of attacks from the other side. Ted Cruz will be attacked and described as a liar by the Democrats and some Republicans. Hillary Clinton would be viewed as very dishonest, hence her email allegations and her tenure as Secretary of State. This election is expected to have a lot of mudslinging and attacks,  but according to current polls, Clinton has a very slight advantage.<br><br>How will their campaign play out? Can Cruz become the first Hispanic-American president?
