This comes after the record breaking loses incurred by several teams during the 2009 MLB season, with the economy barely recovering following it's dive in 2008. Several teams were hoping that the economy would slowly recover over the course of the year, but this came to pass with consumer confidence crashing again, leading to several infamous scenes, including This scene of a Marlin's game where there were only five thousand in attendance. The teams dissolved include the Marlins, Seattle Mariners, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, and Cincinnati Reds.<br><br>All teams owners came to a mutual decision to enact this extraordinary measure, with Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria citing 'unrecoverable losses' as a result of the season. The teams minor league affiliates have all discussed options, including mergers of the five teams into one affiliate in each league and attempting to survive as an independent team, though the MiLB itself is in crisis due to the economic situation.

He has called upon Russia forces to cease the assault, or the US will continuously send military arms to Ukraine. Thus far domestic resistance to this initiative has been muted-though the US economy continues to lag, Speaker Gephardt and Senate Majority Leader Daschle have pledged continued support for Ukrainian forces, despite some doveish opposition. The front runner for the 2000 Democratic nomination, Wesley Clark, has also pledged support for Ukraine.''<br><br>''In other news, the conscription crisis in Russia has continued to rage, as domestic opposition in the Soviet Union to this third round of conscription has only heated domestic resistance to the war.

To be slain like this and to not be brought to justice, is just unacceptable. I call upon all Americas, Democrat or Republican, to stand with me, to bring these vile monsters to justice. Be assured America. We will find justice.''<br><br>The crowd begins to clap. ''Now at this juncture, we must consider the election. Me and the Party have come to the conclusion that the election will be postponed for one year, until November of 2009, for America to settle. Rest be assured that Mr. Dean will still be given the opportunity to run, and certainly whatever challenger he faces in lieu of President McCain will step forward and do an excellent job representing this country. I apologize for the inconvenience, but there is no way elections can be held now.''<br><br>He breathes in. ''America, we have always been strong. We are the indispensable nation. From Syria, to Iraq, to the fields of Russia, to Ukraine, we have protected liberty across the world. We will continue to do so. America, I promise you this. The Terrorists will not win.

Governor Wilson of California had all the makings of a President - the governor of a large, competitive state, who still wielded massive influence over policy. He knew when to moderate, and how to appeal to conservatives. With the fluke that was Bush's victory four years ago, it was perhaps possible for Wilson to put America and the Republican Party back onto the track of normalcy. I'm sure you all know the story from here. Wilson's campaign was perhaps the worst we've ever seen in a modern campaign. He completely misread a distaste of Bush's domestic vision as a shift towards isolationism by the population. Wofford outflanked him on this issue - even getting him a good write up in this magazine on his foreign policy agenda. While I myself voted for Wilson, I know many fellow Conservatives who felt Wilson's stumbling on foreign issues forced their hand, and voted for Wofford.<br>For a Republican to win in 2000, these are the voters they will need to win back. Funding Ukraine will be of utmost importance as not just a plank on the GOP platform, but active policy the candidate is talking about. Rumblings of a Keyes candidacy must be defeated swiftly by Republicans. We will need ourselves a new Reagan, someone who can unify the party and give the American people hope, strength, and a break.

A now cult classic, with a subreddit used by only 1000 members, starring Keanu Reeves-yes, that Keanu Reeves.<br><br>''Dude!'' ''Excellent!''<br><br>''Yes, Ted, from Bill and Ted, is a hacker named Neo who discovers that his bland, drab life as a computer programmer is actually a computer simulation, run by robots who keep real humans trapped in the simulation to harvest their energy. The film is, action-wise, honestly pioneering. Inspired by John Wu cinema and Hong Kong action flicks, we get to watch Ted jump off buildings, slow down time with his mind, dodge bullets. And honestly? It’s super badass.<br><br>Unfortunately, however, the film was a failure. You may recognize the directors as the Wachowski sisters-yes, those Wachowskis, the directors of the Hulk movies-and honestly, that was their critical redemption after this film’s utter failure. It barely made back its budget-probably didn’t with marketing, and was totally critically ignored, though those who saw it seemed to like it. Why did The Matrix fail? It’s super unique and totally badass-it feels like a commercial success in the making.<br><br>The key is to understand, I think, the philosophy of the film compared to that time. The Matrix is about a world that is so stale, so boring, so fake, that accepting a world of conflict that’s realer is better than drab, boring, fake, ordinary life. In the year it came out, 1999, the crisis in Russia was still in full swing, with Americans terrified that it could go nuclear at any moment. The ordinary world was still scary with the Cold War. It was seeming like there was nothing anybody in the US could do to stop global annihilation. How could The Matrix possibly resonate with that? Ultimately, it’s such a unique piece of cinema that just didn’t fit in in a world of crises in Ukraine, and couldn’t do nearly as well as movies like Waterworld.</FONT></p>"];

Cohen, who was coming up on his 18th year in the United States Senate, was retiring from the chamber and politics as a whole. He was often isolated from his Republican allies in the chamber, seen as far too moderate and a representation of a GOP that had moved away from his type of politics. But he was also known for his interest in Intelligence and Armed Forces, making him a potentially useful ally to someone like Willson, who too had tendancies to buck the national party.<br><br>Even then, many expected Cohen to be considered for the role of Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense in a Wilson administration. But being selected as Vice president, and then prevailing against the Wofford/Heflin ticket is a whole other matter. Now, Cohen sits in a position rarely afforded to other Vice Presidents - rather than just focusing on the squabbles of Congress, Cohen is a chief policymaker when it comes to foreign issues - never missing a meeting, and frequently having the final say before the President makes a decision. Jokes around Cohen being the ''puppetmaster'' are somewhat common amongst Democrats, although Cohen too has a decent reputation with Senate and House Democrats. Over the years, both as being the first to support the impeachment of Nixon, declining to support many Republican social policies, and being a longstanding advocate to support regulations on lobbying and gifts to members of Congress, Cohen has built a reputation as an independent thinker and has frequently gained crossover support in his bids for reelection.<br>Cohen's current quest is to strike an end to the ongoing Soviet Civil War, or at least put an opposition leader in a much more favorable position. In some corners of the Administration, support for the Northern Russian Front, led by Sergei Shoigu and Vladimir Putin has increased over the past year. Cohen has lobbied hard for Wilson to discredit this group, especially after news spread to the west over the violent crackdown during the Arkhangelsk Uprising. Cohen instead prefers the Russian and Eurasian Unity Alliance, led by Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>", "<h3>Ending 39 - <i>Vice</i> Review: Sympathy or Sarcasm? - Vox, October 2018</h3><p>I don't need to explain that many of us Americans recognize how unusually meteoric of a rise former Vice President William Cohen had. He was no headline maker like future Vice President Paul Wellstone, or a longtime giant in the Senate like Bob Dole during his campaigns. Cohen was an outcast, an outsider, and a maverick. He supported government transparency, unified foreign policy, and avoided the many wedge issues of the day. But Vice seems to suffer from a jarring indecisiveness that ultimately drags the film down.<br><br>There's a lot going for this film. Christian Bale does an excellent job as Vice President himself, and he works perfectly within that role. Adam McKay clearly had a vision for the character, and someone like Bale does a great job at showing us who Cohen is. The issue does not lie in the casting, or the lighting, or the scenery, or even parts of the script. Rather, it is a lack of resolute on whether we're supposed to root for, or feel bad for Cohen.<br><br>Much of the movie, narrated by Aaron Paul, details a Cohen who has grown more and more distant from his home state of Maine. In this regard, we are expected to root against the Vice President. When Cohen and his wife are nearly killed in a terrorist attack at a Holocaust Rememberance museum, the film plays it off as karma for Cohen taking over more and more of foreign policy, yet getting little done with it. At the same time, it feels as though the film wants us to feel bad for Cohen when he loses the 2004 election to Tom Daschle and Paul Wellstone.<br><br>This goes into a broader issue with a film about Cohen, especially criticizing him from the direction of the left - everyone has mixed feelings about him. Some liberals respect his desire to bring Democrats to the table during Wilson's administration. Others feel his passiveness gave rise to the right-wing of the party and the rise of Rush Limbaugh. Both of these viewpoints, in my view, are entirely valid. But if you're going to make a film about William Cohen, you have to understand how you feel about him.<br><br>⭐2.5/5 Stars<br></p>"];

Gunderson’s sudden resignation took political insiders by surprise, as the vice president was believed to be an effective political operative and close ally of the president, deftly assisting him in welfare reform and in developing a strategy to muster UN support for a war in Afghanistan. While the Vice President cited, <q>extreme personal struggles</q> as a reason for resigning, operatives ponder whether it was perhaps his differences with the President over policy towards Ukraine, or the recent failure of Wilson’s round of tax cuts, or the stunning GOP defeat in the midterms, which finally pushed the Vice President over the edge.<br><br>Regardless, the President appears to have extreme difficulty finding a new replacement for the VP, the second time he has had to do so since he kicked Senator Helms off the ticket in ‘96, bucking all political advice to keep him off the ticket. Rumor has it that Speaker Gephardt and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell are keen to rejecting many members of President Wilson’s shortlist, including Senator Nickles of Oklahoma, Senator Dole of Kansas, and Representative Watts of Oklahoma, Rumor has it that President Wilson may have settled on Representative Santorum of Pennsylvania, whose political fortunes have been buoyed by Wilson’s harsh-anti gay marriage bill which recently passed the increasingly liberal congress. Regardless, Santorum may be considered too right wing to choose, though some insiders believe Mitchell and Gephardt will view him as an easier opponent in 2000.

The primary field cleared out to be nearly exclusively a two-person matchup with Jesse Helms, the former Vice President candidate in 1996, and Bill Weld, the popular former Governor of Massachusetts, clashing against each other, much to the dismay of other Republicans. Outside of an Alan Keynes campaign which has struggled to get off the ground, the campaign in Iowa has effectively been this story, with Helms going into the caucus as the strong favorite. With New Hampshire effectively uncontested, the state became the fight to win, with both campaigns dedicating significant time to the brawl.<br><br>Despite Helms's strong support in the extremely evangelical portions of the state, mainly consolidated in the Northwest, Weld won strong margins in the urban and eastern parts of the state, enough to defeat Helms with a seven-point margin. Keynes received 7% of the vote, mainly in the same areas Helms did well. Interviews with several voters cited Helms's loss in 1996, his age, and the ugly nature of his campaigning in what has quickly become an extremely divisive contest. One Iowa City voter said '''We can't [stomach] a heavy loss. This is the man who lost with Wilson. I hate voting for Weld, but I can't... Helms grosses me out, that's all.''<br><br>While Weld may have won the caucus, more rumblings of trouble down the road could hamper his campaign, particularly with the evangelical base Helms is dominating. While Weld has pushed his social views to the right, he remains a liberal in the party. Depressed turnout was notable. Nevertheless, the win is extremely embarrassing for Helms, who thought the contest was locked up. It remains to be seen on if Weld can carry his momentum into the rest of the states.</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 41 - The issue with bias and the 'Modding Elite' - r/thecampaigntrail - posted by u/Random-Refrigerator-389</h3><p>As a long time user, it pisses me off that a lot of the modern mods are biased against the Freedom Party.

As Vice President (and therefore, President of the Senate), Bob Dole has in many ways taken over the role that he's long dreamed of and returning to greater influence in the United States Senate. He's become kingmaker in regards to breaking some ties with the newly forged 'Millennium Coalition' - a group of all 46 Republicans and 4 Democrats that have broken the old system of the United States Senate in order to help pass President Wilson's agenda through such means as reforming the filibuster and the hearing of bills for votes.<br><br>But past this, Dole's role within the Wilson administration has been rather mixed from the eyes of the White House. Dole has the lowest track record in regards to cabinet meeting attendance, and often spends more time in his Senate office than at the White House. When he does attend cabinet meetings, he is often quick to feud with some members over the foreign policy strategy of the administration -especially regarding the conflicts in Yugoslavia, and the Wilson Administration's apprehension in getting involved.<br><br>Depending on how negotiations for the next budget go, it's entirely possible that Wilson allies will move to have him removed from the ticket come 2000 - quite an ironic twist given how he became Vice President. It should also be noted that in the special election to fill his old Senate seat, appointed incumbent Sam Brownback is trailing Kansas Insurance Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius by around 8 points.

Mnuchin, a film producer, has already stated his intentions to shift the focus of TRUTH off of text-based posts and onto short-form video content.</p>"];

During all of these periods, the central Russian government exerted plenty of control over the region - but no matter what methods they took, they never could seem to completely quell the national identity of Ukraine. But the situation Ukraine faces in the 1990s is the ultimate test of survival. Soviet Russia is a husk of its former glory, yet remains vengeful. The politburo of bolshevik hardliners that now run the USSR seek to reassert control over its territory. They will do so by increasingly horrific and barbaric means - including attacks on civilian centers.<br><br>As of now, the President of the United States has refused to support official American recognition of Ukrainian independence. Our country does not recognize the nation as a sovereign and independent country. You cannot travel to America under a Ukrainian passport. To the eyes of the United States Government, 'Ukraine' does not exist. Rather, a region known as the 'Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic' exists inside of the USSR. This is not a civil war, however. This is a war of independence, and America should do the right thing and recognize this fact.</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Ending 45 - Ukraine makes big push to enter Eurovision - BBC, January 18th, 1997 </h3><p>Despite the continuing war in the Ukrainian SSR, Ukrainian representatives have sought to push for inclusion of the country into the qualifiers for the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest. These representatives, and groups from Poland and Hungary argue that the addition of Ukraine would provide them with much needed publicity and a significant morale boost as they face off against the onslaught of Russian forces.<br><br>Reportedly, these talks seem to be going well, although it's uncertain how likely Ukraine will be able to qualify for the 1998 contest, is expected to be held in April or May of 1998. British and French representatives seem to be in favor of entry for the country into the 1999 contest, likely at a point where the outcome of the war will be more clear.<br><br>Nevertheless, Ukrainian lobbying has only intensified in recent weeks with the recent offensive on the strategic port of Sevastopol. It remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome of this push will be - given some apprehension by Spain and Italy.</p>"];
