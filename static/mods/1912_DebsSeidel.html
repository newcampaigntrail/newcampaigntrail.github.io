On this striving of the human spirit towards the light of the sun depends our optimism and our faith in a better future, and for this reason there must never be any feeling of hopelessness…Hypocrisy is man’s evil genius—in words love, and in practice a merciless struggle for existence, for a so-called happiness, for pelf and place… To be a bright torch for others, to be able to shed light—that is the supreme happiness which man can achieve. He who achieves this, fears neither suffering, pain, sorrow nor need. Death no longer holds terrors for him, although it is only then that he learns really to love life. Only in this way will man be able to make his way through the world with open eyes and see and hear everything, only in this way will he emerge from his own narrow shell into the light and be able to feel both the joys and the sorrows of humanity, only in this way will he become a real man.</p><p>Your brother,</p><p>Felix</p>`)

Debs and the Idea of Socialism</h3><h4>By Howard Zinn</h4><p>In the era of Debs, the first seventeen years of the twentieth century-until war created an opportunity to crush the movement-millions of Americans declared their adherence to the principles of socialism. Those were years of bitter labor struggles, the great walkouts of women garment workers in New York, the victorious multiethnic strike of textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the unbelievable courage of coal miners in Colorado, defying the power and wealth of the Rockefellers. The I.W.W. was born-revolutionary, militant, demanding “one big union” for everyone, skilled and unskilled, black and white, men and women, native-born and foreign-born.</p><p>More than a million people read Appeal to Reason and other socialist newspapers. In proportion to population, it would be as if today more than three million Americans read a socialist press. The party had 100,000 members, and 1,200 office-holders in 340 municipalities. Socialism was especially strong in the Southwest, among tenant farmers, railroad workers, coal miners, lumberjacks. Oklahoma had 12,000 dues-paying members in 1914 and more than 100 socialists in local offices. It was the home of the fiery Kate Richards O'Hare. Jailed for opposing the war, she once hurled a book through a skylight to bring fresh air into the foul-smelling jail block, bringing cheers from her fellow inmates.</p><p>The point of recalling all this is to remind us of the powerful appeal of the socialist idea to people alienated from the political system and aware of the growing stark disparities in income and wealth-as so many Americans are today. The word itself “socialism” may still carry the distortions of recent experience in bad places usurping the name. But anyone who goes around the country, or reads carefully the public opinion surveys over the past decade, can see that huge numbers of Americans agree on what should be the fundamental elements of a decent society: guaranteed food, housing, medical care for everyone; bread and butter as better guarantees of “national security” than guns and bombs; democratic control of corporate power; equal rights for all races, genders, and sexual orientations; a recognition of the rights of immigrants as the unrecognized counterparts of our parents and grandparents; the rejection of war and violence as solutions for tyranny and injustice.</p><p>There are people fearful of the word, all along the political spectrum. What is important, I think, is not the word, but a determination to hold up before a troubled public those ideas that are both bold and inviting-the more bold, the more inviting. That’s what remembering Debs and the socialist idea can do for use.</p>`)

Socialism is the collective ownership and democratic management of the social means of production and distribution — while Bolshevism, as far as I understand it, is communism combined with syndicalism. And this is my chance to say a few words explanatory of Socialism. Like every new phase of civilization, Socialism thus far has received the attention only of the oppressed and the lowly. The opulent and the rich have no reason to wish for a change of the present system. They do not, as a rule, want to hear anything about it. Until of late, outside of the working class, only students of history, of political economy, and a few advanced thinkers have given any attention to the principles of Socialism. Most other persons have only a very vague idea even of its basis. Yet Socialism is in the foreground of discussion today.</p><p>But it is said that the Socialists are revolutionists. Very well! We are revolutionary, not in the vulgar meaning of the word, however, which is entirely wrong, but in the sense illustrated by history, the only logical sense. I believe it is foolish to expect any results from riots and dynamite, from murderous attacks and conspiracies, in a country where we have the ballot, long as the ballot has not been given a full and fair trial. We want to convince the majority of the people. As long as we are in the minority, we, of course, have no right to force our opinions upon an unwilling majority. Besides, as modern men and true democrats, we have a somewhat less romantic and boyish idea of the development of human things and social systems. And we know that one can kill tyrants and scare individuals with dynamite and bullets, but one can not develop a system in that way. Lenin and Trotsky are finding this out to their dismay. Therefore, no true Socialist ever dreams of a sudden change of society. We may have revolutions, if neither the capitalists nor the workmen make good use of their brains, but greater than all revolutions is evolution. We know perfectly well that force serves only those who have it; that a sudden overthrow invariably breeds dictators; that dictatorship can promote only subjugation, never freedom.</p><p>I have even proposed a general and methodical arming of all people as the safest means of preventing sudden upheavals and preserving genuine democracy. That would, as a matter of course, also end the dictatorship of the plutocracy.</p>`)
