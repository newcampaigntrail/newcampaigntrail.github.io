        The summer of 54 was a hot one, especially in St. Louis. Everywhere, tourists and visitors were struggling to keep cool in the Missouri heat… But not Disney and Lindbergh. Missouri natives, the two knew exactly what to do in the heat: get a cone of ice cream. And so, the two former candidates for the Republican 1952 ticket ate vanilla and chocolate ice cream, happily biting and licking away at the sweet treat.
        <br></br>
        “I’m not sure why we never visited here.” Disney said, cheerfully taking bites of his scoops. “Hell, we were both from Missouri, we should have come home for a visit.”
        <br></br>
        “I’m actually not from Missouri.” Lindbergh said in between spoonfuls of chocolate. “I was born and raised in Minnesota, but I moved here when I was a young man.”
        <br></br>
        “Then why didn’t we visit Minnesota? That would have been grand as well-”
        <br></br>
        “Walt, they might have run us out on a rail.”
        <br></br>
        “...True.”
        A long, awkward pause echoed, until Lindbergh stilled its verberation.
        <br></br>
        “Let me ask you something: Do you regret running for President, Walt?”
        <br></br>
        “Well… as much as I would be honored to have sat in the Oval Office, I don’t think it would have been where I belong. I’m a dreamer, and the role of the President sort of… kills anything outside of it, especially dreams. Frankly, both of us would have been killed by our roles, you’re just as much of a dreamer as I am, Charles. Our roles in society are to lift others in spirits and hopes, to fill their hearts with happiness. I’d go so far as to say ultimately, that’s why we lost.”
        <br></br>
        “I can see that.” Lindbergh said, eating the vanilla ice cream in contemplation. Another long pause.
