Taft is unlikely to run again, with his bid in 1908 largely coming from Roosevelt's request.

But the truth is, you did not expect to be serving it like this. Once you were nominated, however, you had a feeling that victory was all but assured - the Republican split was too much for any man to overcome, even a bull moose like Roosevelt. You will enter Congress with large Democratic majorities, and leaders in both chambers looking to get to work.</p><p>The big question about any second term is the Republican Party. It's possible that Roosevelt will try to continue his party into 1914, which could be good news for you and your party. If reconciliation begins, then that is bad news for you - make sure to try to keep them split, or appeal to one side as you attempt to win a second term in 1916. Best of luck!</p>";

You aren't going to be President in 1913, that is for certain. Thankfully, you still have your Senate post, but as a dark horse, it's unlikely you'll have another chance to run again.</p><p>Rumor has it that Wilson is the frontrunner for the 1916 campaign. Maybe with some luck, you'll have a place in a future Democratic cabinet - Wilson will hopefully continue to write to you, perhaps to gain your support for another run.</p>";

But still, not everyone in the party is progressive.</p><p>Parts of your agenda may unfortunately be compromised. If you're elected in 1916, let alone renominated, is a different story.

So too will John Kern, leader of the Senate Democrats, help you shepard your agenda into law.</p><p>With a likely Republican reconciliation in the next few years, you need to be careful. The people of America are expecting great progress on reform, such as the dismantling of monopolies, banking reform, suffrage, tariffs, and more. If you can get these laws through Congress, 1916 should be winnable, but it will be an uphill battle regardless.

In any case, the next Speaker of the House should be a strong ally as you attempt to pass a variety of progressive bills into law. Republicans are likely to reunify between now and 1916, with the nominee being anyone's guess - but if you act quickly, who is to say you can't gain some of Roosevelt's supporters with legislative overtures?

Thankfully, you have enough clout as Speaker of the House to easily get your election.</p><p>Parts of your agenda may unfortunately be compromised.

You're the first person since James Polk to rise to the Presidency from the Speakership, and no former slave state has had a President since the discredited Andrew Johnson.</p><p>Oscar Underwood is due to be the next Speaker, unless you wish to support someone else's bid. In any case, the next Speaker of the House should be a strong ally as you attempt to pass a variety of progressive bills into law. Republicans are likely to reunify between now and 1916, with the nominee being anyone's guess - but if you act quickly, who is to say you can't gain some of Roosevelt's supporters with legislative overtures?

You aren't going to be President in 1913, that is for certain. Thankfully, you still have your position in the House of Representatives.</p><p>But be careful - given the loss just incurred by the Democratic Party, there is always a good chance that Congressional Democrats will backstab you and remove you from your post. In any case rumor has it that Wilson is the frontrunner for the 1916 campaign.

But still, not everyone in the party is progressive. Thankfully, you have enough clout as Speaker of the House to easily get your election.</p><p>Parts of your agenda may unfortunately be compromised.

  e.pages.push(`<h3>On This Day in History: Former President Thomas Marshall Vanishes Climbing Mount Everest, <i>Smithsonian Magazine | May 17, 2023</i></h3><p>Thomas Marshall wore many a hat during his Presidency. Among the feathers in the first Hoosier president's cap are a staunch opposition to eugenics, progressive reform with repsect for the states, and a cautious foreign policy, however controversial in the minds of historians today some of the latter have become. Even so, Marshall is remembered in the public imagination not for being one of only two Democrats to occupy the White House in the fourth party system, and not for his self-depracating humor either, but for the circumstances following his later disappearance on the treacherous slopes of Mount Everest one hundred years ago today.</p><p>Marshall's narrow defeat in 1916 to Leonard Wood reportedly left him bitter and frustrated, and he almost entirely secluded himself from the public for the remainder of the decade. However, as the economy took off in the 1920s, the former President soon found an interest in exploration. Having seen all there is to see in the realm of domestic politics, he turned to conquering the corners of nature, helping finance a 1920 expedition to the South Pole. By 1922, Marshall's increasing interest in mountaineering had led him to meet English explorer George Mallory, and the two arranged an ambitious expedition to summit Mount Everest in May 1923.</p><p>At first, the expedition got off to a rocky start, taking unusually long to ascend the mountain's North Ridge after weather delays and equipment malfunctions. However, the team rallied after the weather subsided, establishing a well-supplied camp at about 27,000 feet above sea level. It was at this point that Marshall joined Mallory's advance team with his own suite of sherpas.</p><p>On May 17, Mallory, followed by climbers Andrew Irvine and Elliot B. Moseley was about to dispatch for the final climb to the top when they were stopped by an animated Marshall. The former president, clad in a climbing suit and oxygen tanks, expressed his desire to witness "the splendor of God's kingdom from its highest point." Mallory agreed, and the four climbers departed for the summit at 6:17 AM. They were never seen again, although evidence was later found suggesting that they passed the Second Step and neared the summit, marking their final location as much closer to the summit than previously realized.</p><p>Over the next three months, a search party scoured the slopes of Everest, but no trace of the climbers, or the former president, were ever found. It would be another 24 years until Sir Albert Pendelton summitted Everest in 1947, laying at the summit a plaque dedicated to Mallory, Irvine, Moseley, and Marshall.</p><p>Some have suspected that Marshall was murdered by the Mafia, citing his reformist policies and debts to them over mountaineering as a potential motive to assassinate the former president. Others believe that Marshall faked his death to escape these debts, descending the slope on an alternate route and using local sherpas to reach civilization under an assumed identity. However, the most likely explanation is perhaps the most straightforward one: that, like thousands of explorers before him, he gallantly gave his life in pursuit of human knowledge and achievement.</p>`)

According to a BEP insider, is the understanding of both the President and the Bureau that none of these designs will depict Former President Andrew Jackson, the current occupant of the bill's obverse, in any way.</p><p>This position aligns Powell with progressive activists, but not for the reason they'd like. Indeed, Jackson's widely-condemned support for the Indian Removal Act and the forced marching of Native Americans reportedly had nothing to do with Powell's decision, which was instead motivated by Andrew Jackson's opposition to central banking, something that has "always irked" Powell.</p><p>Perhaps more controversial are the rumors that among the potential new faces on the twenty dollar bill is that of former President John Burke, a reformist Democrat and famed architect of the Federal Reserve system. "Andrew Jackson was a Democrat but he understood the dangers of central banking," remarked Senator Ron Paul at a campaign rally in Salt Lake City later that day. "Our current President doesn't. Instead, he's aligned with Washington politicians who want to whitewash the disastrous legacy of central banking."</p><p>YouGov's polling average shows that Powell currently enjoys a comfortable lead in all of next year's Republican primary contests, though some recent surveys in the South, Mountain West, and Pacific Northwest have portrayed a more worrying picture. Perhaps Powell's best argument against nominating Paul lies not in policy, but in his dismal general election polling. Many of the same polls that depict Paul gaining on Powell also show him losing head-to-head matchups by lopsided margins, whether put up against Mark Warner, George Clooney, or Marcy Kaptur. When substituted for President Powell, the Republicans' numbers often jump from dismal to a nearly even race.</p>`)
