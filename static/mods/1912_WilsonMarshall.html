Clark may still be a bit bitter about his loss, but he will do what he needs to in order to help you pass strong, progressive legislation. The tricky part is that you were not the favorite for progressives, so much of your term will be spent attempting to court them.</p><p>No one knows where this leaves the Republican Party - if Roosevelt outpolled Taft, he has a strong case to claim the nomination in 1916, and would prove a formidable fighter. Taft is unlikely to run again, with his bid in 1908 largely coming from Roosevelt's request. In any case, if you choose to run again - prepare yourself for the 1916 campaign, hopefully by passing laws such curbing monopolies, child labor, and more.</p>";

Congress is almost certainly going to have strong Democratic majorities, and with Kern and Clark running both chambers, things seem to be looking up.</p><p>What happens to the Republican Party is a bit of a mystery. Some believe Roosevelt will return to the Grand Old Party's fold, but the 1914 midterms may benefit you as Roosevelt may continue to toy around with his party. Depending on how quickly Republicans reunify, 1916 will be a walk in the park or an uphill battle.

You will enter Congress with large Democratic majorities, and leaders in both chambers looking to get to work.</p><p>The big question about any second term is the Republican Party. It's possible that Roosevelt will try to continue his party into 1914, which could be good news for you and your party. If reconciliation begins, then that is bad news for you - make sure to try to keep them split, or appeal to one side as you attempt to win a second term in 1916. Best of luck!</p>";

Congressman James Cox will take the role as Governor of Ohio, while you will move into the White House. Clark is still a bit bitter, but is eager to pass progressive legislation as Speaker of the House. So too will John Kern, leader of the Senate Democrats, help you shepard your agenda into law.</p><p>With a likely Republican reconciliation in the next few years, you need to be careful. The people of America are expecting great progress on reform, such as the dismantling of monopolies, banking reform, suffrage, tariffs, and more. If you can get these laws through Congress, 1916 should be winnable, but it will be an uphill battle regardless.

Indeed, you have won the day. A large mandate, an increased House majority, and possibly the United States Senate. This may be the first trifecta for Democrats in nearly twenty years. You're the first person since James Polk to rise to the Presidency from the Speakership, and no former slave state has had a President since the discredited Andrew Johnson.</p><p>Oscar Underwood is due to be the next Speaker, unless you wish to support someone else's bid. In any case, the next Speaker of the House should be a strong ally as you attempt to pass a variety of progressive bills into law. Republicans are likely to reunify between now and 1916, with the nominee being anyone's guess - but if you act quickly, who is to say you can't gain some of Roosevelt's supporters with legislative overtures? Best of luck to you!</p>";
  campaignTrail_temp.candidate_json[0]["fields"].electoral_loss_message = "<h3>'Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory'</h3><p>This is absolutely baffling. Many had expected that you would be able to win easily. Not only have you not secured an electoral majority, the election won't even make it to the House of Representatives. You aren't going to be President in 1913, that is for certain. Thankfully, you still have your position in the House of Representatives.</p><p>But be careful - given the loss just incurred by the Democratic Party, there is always a good chance that Congressional Democrats will backstab you and remove you from your post. In any case rumor has it that Wilson is the frontrunner for the 1916 campaign. Maybe with some luck, you'll have a place in a future Democratic cabinet, or can help fight Republican agendas, or support Democratic ones.</p>";

Nevertheless, no candidate shall have an electoral college majority. Obviously, you are still on track to be elected President, since Democrats and Progressives made House gains. But still, not everyone in the party is progressive. Thankfully, you have enough clout as Speaker of the House to easily get your election.</p><p>Parts of your agenda may unfortunately be compromised. If you're elected in 1916, let alone renominated, is a different story. You start the next administration and the next campaign as the underdog. Best of luck to you!</p>";

Fairbanks secured the nomination yesterday after several rounds of balloting, aided by former President Taft. Roosevelt has been vague about his intentions for the 1916 campaign, but has seemingly implied that he would endorse an 'acceptable' Republican candidate, although he would not explain who this candidate may be.<br><br>Some, especially Taft, seemed to believe that Roosevelt was referring to himself, and refused to give into his requests. The main delegation battle was between Fairbanks, backed by Taft's faction, and General Leonard Wood, backed by Roosevelt's allies. In the end, Fairbanks won, although it remains to be seen how Roosevelt shall respond.</p>`)

While he had originally helped pass progressive legislation and was allied with folks like Teddy Roosevelt, it became clear that these radical progressives had sought to overtake the Republican Party, and were willing to attack the constitution to do so. During his second term, President Taft met with figures from both other parties to form a new, conservative party. Democrats had been struggling since the 1914 elections, and conservative Republicans have been eager for a change in course.<br><br>Thus, in 1915, the Conservative Party was formed. The remaining members of the Republican and Democratic Parties decided to merge with the Bull Mooses to form the Progressive Party in its current shape. The Conservatives have, since formation, won many Presidential elections and have more often than not won control of Congress.</p>`)

At an opening of a national park in northern New York, when asked by reporters about the 1916 campaign, Roosevelt said he was unsure about what would happen, but wanted to ensure that a progressive was elected. Roosevelt himself has been rather mysterious and cautious about his intentions in the next Presidential election.<br><br>Some believe he shall run in the 1916 campaign, while others believe he will ask Hiram Johnson to run as the Bull Moose candidate. Roosevelt defied all normal expectations and ran for - and won - a third term, so breaking the tradition further may not be as unrealistic as some may expect. Some critics, however, believe he wishes to serve as President of the United States for life. No matter what happens, Roosevelt seems very invested in influencing the candidates, the issues talked about, and the outcome.</p>`)
