The Gulf War started back in August and has proven to be unpopular for Republicans. Of course, Blanchard is the favorite, but could Engler prove this statement wrong? \n\n<ul><li> Current Governor Blanchard must reflect on his term and keep his distance from the scandals around him and his campaign.</li><li> John Engler is the underdog and must attack Blanchard about the skeletons in his closet if he wants any chance of winning this race.</li></ul>",

Eight years later, he would see himself as a member of the Michigan Senate. Five years after his term in the Michigan Senate started, he became the Majority Leader for the Michigan Senate.

Well, Blanchard's scandals really affected his performance, and exposing the secrets he had been hiding increased your chances of winning. So now that you are governor, you could be as popular as Blanchard was. Could you run for re-election in 1994? Well, whatever you choose is your business, John. Good Luck!</p> ",
