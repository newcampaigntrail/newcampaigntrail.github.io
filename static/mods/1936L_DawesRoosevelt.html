He also composed a hit song.</p><p>While I personally disagree with a number of Dawes’ personal views, I believe he was a truly extraordinary man, whose talent as a diplomat, soldier, banker, politician, and musician dwarfed most others. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure I fully did him justice. If you want to learn more about him, I’d recommend reading “Portrait of an American: Charles Dawes,” which, while out of print, is easily accessible online.</p>"
