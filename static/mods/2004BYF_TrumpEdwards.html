We have successfully avenged George W. Bush and the Republicans after stealing the election and cheating to win the 2000 election in Florida, and this election was not even close. There is convincing evidence that the American people legitimately wanted this for Al Gore in 2000 and now they're voting for me to seek revenge and retribution from the disaster of 2000. <p><p>There is one thing I will say to the President: Bush, You're Fired!</p>",
