This was a shocking defeat for the President, even more than George H.W. Bush in 1992. But nevertheless, this is very exciting news for the Democrats, as they have won their biggest landslide in at least 25 years, if not more.<p><p>The Republicans are furious at the sore loser Donald Trump for causing this to happen, since he took so many Republican votes away from Schwarzenegger in many states. But it doesn't matter right? Just get your bags packed and get ready to move into the White House to become the 46th President of the United States. You can be an ass-kicker, I guarantee you!</p>`;

So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.</p>`;
