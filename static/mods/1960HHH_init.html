Holding great admiration among the farmers and progressives of the Democratic Party, Humphrey will chart a new path for the party this election season, he's worked too hard to let it go to waste.<p>Despite the celebrations, the outlook couldn't look more menacing. Humphrey is only popular among progressives; his popularity among moderates and conservatives is six feet under, and Nixon holds a 15% head-start lead in the early polling. To win, Humphrey must prove to Americans that he isn't a dangerous radical and weather its storm.",

Additionally, he would fight the nickname that you'd be another old New Deal \"tax-and-spend\" liberal, which could be useful if you use it correctly.<p>However, Chandler's most famous actions did not happen while in politics, as in 1947, he famously allowed Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier by approving his contract and threatening disciplinary action against those who would strike against him. This has not been forgotten by those in the old South and would hamper any bold moves into the segregationist South. His unflinching fiscal conservatism would also be a tough pill for you and your liberal base to swallow.
