You’ve managed to defend Democrats down ballot, leaving congress in your party’s hands - though not without a few losses. The Republicans are scrambling, trying to make sense of how the hell this could have happened.</p><p>The good news is, in light of everything, the Republicans now have divisions almost deeper than those within the Democrats. Having Sanford as Vice President will help keep the South in line, and Young’s moderate domestic policy should be palatable to most wings. Across the aisle, Goldwaterites and Conservatives are desperately trying to cling to power, while liberal Republicans lambast them for this embarrassing defeat.<br><br><button onclick='nexte19()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending38' style='display: none;'><p><p>The bad news is, this is where your journey ends. You were thrust into the Presidency under the most unforeseen circumstances, and now, ever the hard-working party man, you’ve delivered Young to the white house. You could return to the house if you were so inclined, but the legacy you’ve built will forever be a blip between the infamous President Johnson and the fresh leadership of President Young.</p><p>With a sad smile, you wave to the crowds on inauguration day. It was only a brief shining moment, but you hope you’ve done well for your country, and you welcome the new administration.</p><p>For what it’s worth, President McCormack, America owes you more than they know. At the cusp of Midnight, you lead us, like a shining beacon, into a new dawn.<br><br><button onclick='backe19()'>Back</button></p></span>"
