Republican operators seethe as Donald Trump defiantly declares that he will become the next President of the United States, and that Republican Congressional leaders should be honored to join him.

With you in third, the Senate picks between Tim Kaine and Ben Carson, which is expected to be an odd vote. McConnell is whipping votes for Carson, and with the majority in his hands, most are expecting that he’ll be successful. But with the chance of a Trump victory, moderate are having doubts, and some even think that Kaine could be a ‘moderating influence.’ This all depends on Schumer’s negating tact, but a Carson or Kaine victory, or even a deadlock, is all in the cards. <p><p>Meanwhile, the House of Representatives is, as expected, in Republican hands. With no Rubio, that leaves Republicans in a bizarre spot. Ryan may sign onto Trump, but many rank-and-file Republicans will be reluctant: the Speaker has his work cut out for him, and if enough abstain, the House could deadlock. If that continues, that on January 20th, the Vice President would become the President, and that would certainly be strange. And if the Senate remains deadlocked, then Paul Ryan would end up in the Presidency: only one person wants that.
