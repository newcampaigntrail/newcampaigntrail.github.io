After a series of strong but difficult victories against various primary opponents, including Steve Forbes, Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm, and Bob Dornan, Powell secured the nomination on March 26th, 1996. His victory sparked a third party splinter run by Patrick Buchanan, a paleoconservative commentator who entered the general election soon after Powell's victory. Hoping to reconsolidate his conservative support, Powell selected Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson as his running mate, hoping to use his running mate as an attack dog who could bring in Buchanan voters. Clinton, meanwhile, coasted on his success as the party's standard bearer, shrugging off any speculations of a primary opponent and sailing to re-nomination.<br><br>The race between Clinton, Buchanan, and Powell focused primarily on social concerns, as Clinton had a natural upper hand on the economy and foreign policy was of smaller import. Powell started out the campaign with a large lead, but was slowly whittled down by Clinton's natural popularity, the strength of the economy, his poorer-than-expected performance in the presidential debates, and Buchanan's persistent splinter bid drawing away critical votes in the South. Powell was perhaps buoyed at the last moment by a shocking series of ads by Buchanan's affiliate Oliver North which blamed Powell for covering up the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War, which caused Buchanan to bleed support in areas such as Florida and Texas. Clinton was also harmed by the Buddhist Temple scandal, where Vice President Gore illicitly solicited donations from donors at a Buddhist Temple, which included foreign donors. Ultimately, these two scandals plus Powell's own personal popularity propelled him to a slim victory in the election, making him our nation's 43rd president and our first African-American president.</span><br><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/6dgzNmz.gif\\\" style=\\\"margin-top:1em;\\\"><p></p></div>\", \"has_visits\": 1, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://i.imgur.com/iSaNetB.png\"}}]");
