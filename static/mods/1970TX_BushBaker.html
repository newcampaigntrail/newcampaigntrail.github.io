You have won the 1970 United States Senate election in Texas.</h3><br>As you sit on your sofa with your family around you, waiting for the election results to come in, a sense of dread overcomes you. Did you make the right decisions? Were you too liberal or too conservative? This thought haunts you, but the answer arrives right away from the TV. The News Reporter first goes through the rest of the states in the 1970 midterms before he finally reaches Texas. In one short sentence, he announced to the state of Texas and its 11 million residents that you have won. As you look at the map, you don’t say anything. No one in the room does. Dead silence. You’re stunned. There’s no way. No fricking way.<br><br>You snap out of it when your daughter Dorothy shakes you. Then all of the emotions hit everyone. In an instance, the room turned from silence to jubilation. You are overcome by a sense of triumph. You did it, you conquered the democratic machine and broke it apart. You’re now the leader of a Republican movement. One that will conquer the south and transform them like nearly a century ago. You’re in shock, your muscles feel weak and you can’t even move from your sofa. You turn to your family. Barbara notices you and asks if you’re okay. You tell her everything’s alright and she kisses you on the cheeks. George and Jeb celebrate like a bunch of frat boys, jumping up and down as if they just won the Super Bowl. George runs up to you, shaking you while yelling about your victory. You just flash a smile and hug him. No more Loser Bush or Little Shrub, now it’s time for Poppy to be the one in charge.<br><br>At Bentsen’s concession speech the next day, he appears late, visibly tired and disheveled. He looks like he aged 10 years before going to the podium. He tries to start his speech but boos and jeering start overwhelming him. He looks up to see a sizable group of Yarborough and liberal supporters headed by none other than Yarborough himself, start telling him to get off the stage. He tries to speak louder than them but his voice is too exhausted, his energy too weak. He cuts it short when they start throwing stuff like marshmallows and campaign pins at him before retreating, probably not wanting to show his face to a single democrat ever again. You can’t imagine what old Lyndon is feeling right now at his ranch. At your speech however, confetti rains down from above while you address the crowd of supporters. Even your appearance gets you a standing ovation. You thank everyone, saying that this is a new age for not only Texas politics but for the south as a whole. You feel as if your destiny is in your hands now. No more Nixon, no more secret funds, none of that. You will be your own man, not beholden to anyone else.<br><br>But something rubs you the wrong way. Counties that have been voting blue since the end of the civil war all of a sudden turn red. Ones where they voted 70, even 80 percent in 1964 suddenly decide Republicans are better. You don’t want to even imagine it, but…no it can’t be. He couldn’t have that much power right? He may be the president but he isn’t god. Or is he. Has this all been a lie, predetermined since the beginning just to get your hopes up. Everything doesn’t line up. What can-or even could-you do? He’s your boss now. Do what he says, say what he wants to hear and don’t question him. You’re just a Bush in an enormous forest ready to be sacrificed to the flame if you ever step out of line.<br></p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Congratulations! You have won the 1970 United States Senate election in Texas.</h3><br>The midterm results completely shock everybody. Not even diehard Nixon Republicans were thinking the midterm effect would shatter right before their very eyes, but it did, by the grace of God. In the end:<br><br>William Roth won the open seat in Delaware.<br>Senator Winston Prouty won re-election in Vermont.<br>Senator Paul Fannin won re-election in Arizona.<br>Senator Hiram Fong won re-election in Hawaii.<br> Senator Roman Hruska won re-election in Nebraska.<br>Senator George Murphy won re-election in California.<br>Senator Ted Stevens won re-election in Alaska.<br>Senate soon-to-be Majority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania won re-election in Pennsylvania.<br><br>The GOP pickups that are counted are absolutely unbelievable.<br><br> Lowell Weicker of Connecticut defeated Joseph Duffey and Senator Thomas Dodd.<br>Bill Brock of Tennessee defeated Senator Al Gore Sr.<br>Robert Taft Jr. won the open seat in Ohio.<br>James Glenn Beall Jr. of Maryland defeated Senator Joseph Tydings.<br>Richard Roudebush of Indiana defeated Senator Vance Hartke.<br>John Danforth of Missouri defeated Senator Stuart Symington.<br>William Cramer of Florida won the open seat.<br>Anderson Carter of New Mexico defeated Senator Joseph Montoya.<br>John Wold of Wyoming defeated Senator Gale McGee.<br>Laurence J. Burton defeated Senator Frank Moss.<br>Nelson Gross of New Jersey defeated Senator Harrison Williams.<br>James Buckley of New York defeated Senator Charles Goodell and Richard Ottinger as a conservative independent, and he plans to caucus with the Republicans.<br><br>Despite these astronomical GOP gains, Senator Ralph Tyler Smith of Illinois is narrowly defeated by Adlai Stevenson III, being the only Democratic gain of the night.<br><br>When all is said and done, the Senate ends up as 53R-45D-2I, and the Republicans flipping a net total of 10 seats. House wise, the GOP shockingly flips the House, with it ending up as 225R-210D and giving them a trifecta. Gerald Ford is very happy at this news, as he gets to finally pursue his dream of being Speaker of the House, like he’s always wanted. Paul Eggers also handily defeated Preston Smith for Governor, so statewide, Republicans have completely transformed Texan politics.<br><br>To put it plainly, conservatives across the nation are ecstatic at this news, and liberals are beyond terrified. The nation had shifted so far from Democratic dominance to the complete opposite within a few years, as many Democrats fear that President Nixon is the second coming of Dwight Eisenhower, whom ironically Nixon served under as Vice President. The Democratic Party is in complete shambles at this utter failure of a midterm. What went wrong? Was Richard Nixon really that popular? Was the 1964 Senate map too unfavorable? Whatever went wrong, Democratic leadership was about to change, and quickly. Soon after these results, DNC Chairman Lawrence O’Brien steps down, and congressional leadership is completely overhauled. Anybody who was responsible for this mishap is immediately thrown out. But while the Democrats scramble to find new leaders to recover from this beat down, Republicans are joyful and happy. They finally have majorities in both chambers of Congress, and <i>you</i> are one of the most notable ones. It’s time to get to work, and show the people of Texas and this nation what you’re made of.<br><br><i>Ending 10 of 10. Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond is playing.</i><br></p>"];

Finally, <i>finally</i>, you’ve not only gotten this accursed seat but nearly doubled or tripled what the best polls for you said. You walk around the room, still baffled but what’s on the screen. You thought that Senator Tower’s result in 1966 was only a result of the 6-year itch and the divisions in the Democratic base due to the Vietnam War but no. You did what everyone said was impossible and then some. You turn to your family. Barbara is clapping, wiping some tears from her eyes as well. George and Jeb are shocked, looking at each other to check if what they’re seeing is real or not. George then comes up to you, saying that maybe in a few years too, he can run for something as well, a house seat perhaps. You tell him that you’ll support wherever he goes while he flashes a smile. You sit back on the sofa, still not being able to comprehend what just happened. You think maybe Nixon could’ve rigged it for you but you brush the thought aside. You made this real, all that blood, sweat and struggle was for this.<br><br>At Bentsen’s concession speech the next day, he looks scared, probably afraid of having to go out to speak to the crowd in the hall. While walking, he notices some glaring at him but he tries to compose himself the best he can before giving a short brief address. His tone was shaky and uncertain, giving him the impression of being held at gunpoint. While trying to end it off, he starts to hear an uproar. He looks up and sees Barbara Jordan and a group of Yarborough supporters taunting and mocking him. He tries to cool it down but a push and shove later, the scene almost devolves into a riot before security breaks it up. At your speech however, confetti rains down and the audience cheers, you thank them all for believing in you. They get louder and you just smile. You hug Barbara once more as you raise your fist in triumph. All those hours you had to campaign, day after day. Putting up posters, giving speeches till you can barely talk, shaking hands with a diverse and wide cast of people. Coming back home every night exhausted while uncertain if any of it mattered at all. It all led to this. Savor the moment, there’ll be more hardships ahead.<br></p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Congratulations!

You have won the 1970 United States Senate election in Texas.</h3><br>As you sit on your sofa with your family around you, waiting for the election results to come in, a sense of dread overcomes you. Did you make the right decisions? Were you too liberal or too conservative? This thought haunts you, but the answer arrives right away from the TV. The News Reporter first goes through the rest of the states in the 1970 midterms before he finally reaches Texas. In one short sentence, he announced to the state of Texas and its 11 million residents that you have won. You rub your eyes before looking at Barbara. She can’t believe it either. You are now the 2nd Republican to win a statewide race in Texas in nearly the past century.<br><br>You are overcome by a sense of amazement. Finally, <i>finally</i>, you’ve not only gotten this accursed seat, but blew Bentsen out of the water. You knocked him out with a clean uppercut to the jaw that he and the Democratic Party will surely not forget. You turn to your family. Barbara kisses you on the check, overjoyed just like you. George and Jeb still can’t believe their eyes as they continue to listen to the TV as they listen intently to every county that flipped. Jeb hugs you, telling you pulled one hell of a miracle. You cheekily told him not to swear but that it was because of you, George and everyone else that you managed to win this. And hey, if you were able to accomplish this, you don’t know what you could do next, Senate Majority Leader, VP, President even? The sky’s the limit.<br><br>At Bentsen’s concession speech the next day, he looks stunned, his face worn down by what just happened. He walks up to the podium ready to begin but he hesitates before speaking. He finishes saying, “I got a real shock on my face when I saw the results. But it was a well-fought campaign by Bush and I wish him the best of luck. I know many of you didn’t want me here a few months ago and it seems the results showed that. I wish I did better for you.” On that note, he ends it, but not before a large group in the back of the crowd, many of them Yarborough supporters, boo him. He takes no heed of them while the audience in front try to clap to counter their booing. At your speech however, confetti rains down and the audience cheers, you thank them all for believing in you. Small or Big, their contributions and support has led to this. They get louder and you just smile. You hug Barbara once more as you raise your fist in triumph. You almost faint from all of this, the feeling being too much. But you look down and see your wife still by your side, with a smile that could light up a room. You think of Robin, your 3 year old daughter who died young from leukemia. How Barbara was so distraught after it happened. And after everything that has happened, she’s back to her old cheerful self.<br><br><i>If you stick to your ideals and have your family by your side through thick and thin, you’ll go far.</i><br></p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>Congratulations!

You have lost the 1970 United States Senate election in Texas.</h3><br>As you sit on your sofa with your family around you, waiting for the election results to come in, a sense of dread overcomes you. Did you make the right decisions? Were you too liberal or too conservative? This thought haunts you, but the answer arrives right away from the TV. The News Reporter first goes through the rest of the states in the 1970 midterms before he finally reaches Texas. In one short sentence, he announced to the state of Texas and its 11 million residents that you have lost. But the margin was close enough to give Bentsen some worry for the next election. You significantly improved from 1964 but still not enough to win it.<br><br>A wave of discontentment hits you. You did better than what most people expected, it was going to be hard to crack Texas but you gave it your best shot. Not enough still, but perhaps enough for a 3rd try in 6 years though you feel exhausted thinking about running again. You turn to your family. Barbara leans on your shoulder, saying you did better than most people thought. George and Jeb both murmur to each other, questioning and wondering what could be if you only had more time. Your son, Marvin, comes up to you and asks if you’re okay. You smile and tell him you’re just tired. You get up from the sofa, leaving the room while passing by aides and advisors. You think what to do for the next couple of years, maybe run for governor, ask Nixon for an executive position, maybe even take a crack at it again but you wave those thoughts away as you prepare for tomorrow.<br><br>The next day at your concession speech, you tell the crowd you gave it all, that you’re proud of not only what you but everyone has accomplished the past few months. The speech is done and over in a couple of minutes. The crowd, though let down, still feel a glimmer of hope. You didn’t get destroyed, taking Bentsen to the 10th round before being defeated. You scared him, for just a moment and that fear is enough to satiate these people. You end it off saying, “It was an honor to be your nominee in this race. I congratulate my opponent, Lloyd Bentsen. I know it’s a gut punch to lose but I’m glad I spent that time with my family.” You walk off the stage as the crowd gives you a standing ovation. You smile, still sad of what could’ve been, but you still have nearly 50 years ahead of you. A lot can change in that time and perhaps these people will see you again, but this time as a winner.<br><br><i>You may be a sore loser, but you know it isn’t the end of your story.

House wise, Gerald Ford had a positive night, and the chamber ended up as 240D-195R, gaining a few but not affecting much.<br><br>The Republicans are ecstatic at these results, especially President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. They feel as though their hard work really did pay off nationwide, as a slew of conservative voices are now ready to help with their agenda, even if you aren’t there in Congress to assist them. However, you have a big feeling that even with your close loss, you know that Nixon and Agnew have future plans with you, and your career is only going to go up from here.
