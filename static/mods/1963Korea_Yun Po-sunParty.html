Of course, it's because the supernatural magical power was involved, named <i>a bigshot</i>, but you wouldn't know this at all. </p><p> Meanwhile, a little kid talked to you walking down the street in despair. 'Cheer up, Mr. President! Although I couldn't vote because I am young, I supported you. I really like you, who have the same surname as me.' You cheered up a little and answered the child.
