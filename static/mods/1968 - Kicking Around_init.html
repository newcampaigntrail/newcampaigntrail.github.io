Though the Civil Rights Act is, after decades of struggle, finally the law of the land, and the economy is booming, America looks more and more alone in the Cold War. President Kennedy has steered America out of numerous foreign conflicts, but the forces of Communism seem eerily close to seizing South Vietnam, echoing the “loss of China” all those years ago.</p>The American populace, have rejected the Kennedy Doctrine of peace through strength, and look towards a hawkish future, rejecting Kennedy&#39s handpicked successors in favor of Senator Jackson, an ardent warhawk. Jackson&#39s opponent, however, is a familiar face, the tricky grin of Richard  Nixon, now governor of California. The Vice President is eager to flex his foreign policy chops, despite his past six years being focused on domestic issues. These two men shall battle it out in a test to determine who shall pick up the banner in America&#39s crusade against communism for the next four years.",

The former Vice President, and the current governor of California, Richard Nixon is perhaps one of the most frighteningly successful nut-cutters in all of politics. A poor boy from Whittier, Nixon rose to Congress on red-baiting, slipped past a corruption scandal to become Vice President, and would have become President had some of his surrogates not said the quiet part about Catholics out loud just before the election. Since his shockingly narrow loss in 1960, Nixon has retired to administering California&#39s affairs, coming near to blows with Jesse Unruh on a billion different priorities all while handling civil rights riots and campus radicals as best as the Right would like him to.</p> Richard Nixon is perhaps the only man qualified on the major issues of the day, both on foreign policy and domestic, and with his strong centrist Republican credentials and his Establishment support he clinched the nomination against right wing saber rattler Barry Goldwater. Nixon must retain his support on the Right enough to not blow his large polling lead over Senator Jackson, and prove that Richard Nixon truly, completely, is a real winner. Nothing will stop him from claiming victory this election.",
