Finally, better weather for all of us. Finally, no more bleak and dreary British weather. We can have the tropical sunshine we’ve always dreamt of. Britain’s departure from Europe isn’t expected to be easy, it’s going to be especially difficult to find a helicopter large enough to transport a country covering 243,610 km² of land.

A vote to Remain, sure, but it goes further. This was all along a vote for Britain to rejoin Europe. Thousands of eager Britons bring their buckets and spades to the North Sea, ready to give their part in draining the North Sea so once again Britain can rejoin the mainland as they wanted. A vision of a future, with Doggerland once again above the waves is a powerful vision to motivate people. Perhaps failing that, maybe the approach is to try to trigger another ice age. Sure, British weather will get worse, but it’s worth it. If enough water can get frozen in glaciers, the water level will come down enough for Britain to finally rejoin Europe. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron announces is intentions to use nuclear weapons to strike volcanoes in Iceland, hopefully triggering eruptions to create a nuclear or volcanic winter. Time will tell if this is successful or not.</p>"]
