Perhaps there’s a seat waiting for you in the senate in 1850 if such a compromise arises, or perhaps you’ll do best to retire to Ashland, one last time.</p>"

President Cass’ gains in the House and Senate seem to put him at an even greater advantage this election cycle and it’s likely the Whig party will soon fade into obscurity. You can die knowing your name will at least be remembered in Liberia.</p>"
