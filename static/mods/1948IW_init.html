Despite being viewed as too conservative by the Liberal Faction and his once unpopular isolationist policies, Mr. Republican Taft is the heavy favorite thanks to an easy path through the primary and an unpopular administration.</p>Still, if he doesn't want to risk splintering like the Democrats, he'll need to moderate a few of his extremist points. However, if he plays his cards right, Isolationism and New Deal rollback could very well be on the horizon, or with the right touch, a pivot may very well open up the South to a Republican for the first time in almost 20 years. Just try not to waste the campaign getting stuck in a bathtub.</p>",

Even if this was expected, it does nothing to dilute the sheer adulation of this victory. Not only have you defeated Henry Wallace and Strom Thurmond, but you've cemented that this new decade shall be one of true conservatism, not at all polluted by all of this New Deal nonsense. Already you're receiving calls from a number of prominent figures such as Thomas Dewey congratulating you on your victory through gritted teeth, and it takes all your self-control no to laugh. Still you're stepping into a landmine of a situation as peace with the Soviets looks in jeporday now that you're replacing Wallace. You could either attempt to salvage this (no chance) or begin taking measures against the growing Communist threat. Whether that be coordinate with other foreign powers or break away and go back to the successful ways of old. Whatever you choose just remember, the people themselves have given you a mandate and now it's time to enforce it!</p>",

In a stunning conclusion you Robert Taft have just been beaten in a race that every single pundit just yesterday had been claiming was guaranteed to be yours. Everything you've every worked for suddenly turns to sand blowing away in the wind as you may have just destroyed the fundamental principles of the Republican Party for decades to come. Already you can feel the claws of those vultures like Dewey and Stassen ready to pull it back to the left. All you can do now is try your best to guide the conservative faction as everything comes crumbling down, maybe if you're fortunate you can at least continue to hold some sway in future platforms. Either way, your chances at the Presidency are definitively over, best to make due with your cotinued service as a Senator.</p>",

Now either this goes to the House and you can only hope that Republicans retained enough of a majority to vote you in, or you may just have to start making deals with the enemy. Whether that be the kooky liberal Wallace, or insane racist Thurmond, neither are the kind of people you would ever want to work with. Unfortunately for you, that may not be an option as the country looks to descend into chaos with protests in both the North and South tearing the country apart right this second. Saddle up Robert, because the true fight has just begun.</p>",

Poor ol' Wallace can't catch a break!</p>To win this election, Wallace can't play it safe, as that's a Roosevelt's luxury. If he wishes to do the unthinkable and hold onto his job, he'll have to enact bold moves and take risky gambles to make an impossible comeback. Otherwise, the very fate of the Negro and the lives of many, will be swept away by the oligarchy of big business and prejudiced rage of the American Fascist.</p>",

Even your own party, which considered your candidacy nothing but a joke, are left gobsmacked, and your smug face in the headlines makes many utterly sick. Their wide-eyed expressions, which more closely resemble Felix the Cat's than those of an ordinary human, only add to your raucous laughter, making this moment even sweeter. It seems your insane gambles along the way paid off! With the shouts of your black supporters ringing through the building, a jubilant Hubert Humphrey even manages to perform a jig as those States' Rights bastards are sent packing back to the deepest corners of Dixie. Already you can see the dream appearing over the horizon: equality for all, no matter the color of their skin! 'Henry Wallace, the man for all of us!'' The crowd cheers; their voices are heard from here to Timbuktu! Saddle up, Mr. President, because this country is ready for another 4 years of Wallace! </p>",

Your hopes to keep the peace and push a new slew of domestic legislation have gone up in flames, with the Democrats weaker than ever. You practically feel Franklin's ghost ready to choke the life out of you for putting his New Deal in jeopardy. Already, talks between the establishment and the S.R.P are in the works to dismantle your Democratic platform and institute a far more Southern friendly one in exchange for bringing back those defectors into the fold. The tide of this country has slipped through your fingers, and the grassroots support you so thoroughly enjoyed has just been cut down by the weedwacker of politics. Your only hope now is that someone like Joseph Kennedy Jr. or Claude Pepper will try to re-energize the disenfranchised Liberal Wing in four years, but other than that, the future looks bleak. As you shuffle your body to bed, you feel as if you've aged twenty years in a single night, and in many respects, death almost seems like an easier fate than living to see tomorrow.

Negros are in the streets protesting this result as their voices are threatened to be silenced! Whites in the South are damaging the property of the few Democrats from the South who supported the NRA as their time looks to be up! And everyone else just sits back in fear at what will happen to this nation now that the powder keg has gone off in spectacular fashion, threatening to tear this country apart just like in 1860! The chances of holding onto your job are fleeting, and at this point, the best case scenario may be for Taft to come out on top. Either way, your time as the head of the party is over.</p>",

Having him as your Running Mate would be a no-brainer, yet the issue is that he would not invite any additional support beyond what you yourself already have. Still, he is a safe choice that will invigorate your party without any controversies that could bite you in the backside.</p>One interesting note would be his time as a Captain in the United States Army serving under the 149th Machine Gun Battalion and the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion before being honorably discharged in 1919. His experience could be a potential way to adhere your candidacy to the growing veteran vote.",

The voice of your House Party Leader Wilbur Mills echoes across the halls of the Municipal Auditorium right before the announcement of your Running Mate. 'I swear if you do this I don't care what it costs me I'm leaving this damn party!' He promises, but you simply ignore his protests. Many question just what the argument was about, and then up on stage you announce your choice.</p>And oh my jesus, as if you couldn't get any more racist, selecting the Leader of the Ku Klux Klan before its disbandment in 1944 is much too extreme even to many of your hardcore Base. You're be absolutely guaranteeing your appeal would be limited only to the Deep South if that and may even cause your Party to be labeled as a terrorist organization by the Federal Government, but hey if that's what you want then go ahead. Who needs a political career anyway. Say goodbye to States' Rights and hello to the Ku Klux Klan Party!",
