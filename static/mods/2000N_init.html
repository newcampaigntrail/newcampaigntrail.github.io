    <p>Hi, this is Decstar. I just wanted to thank you for playing this mod.</p>
    <p>This particular style of mod isn't necessarily the "norm" for TCT, but when I was developing the concept, I thought it would play well in the medium.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy/did enjoy the mod.</p>
    <p>To my fellow developers (who haven't seen this yet): thank you so much for your help with this, I think each of you have done a fantastic job. Thank you for putting up with my 4am schizo ideas for new endings.</p>
    <p>And as always, remember that it's raining somewhere else.</p>
