Please consider taking my four-question <a href='https://forms.gle/jhkJcsAxb3soJXSw6'>survey</a> so I can judge how well I did!<p><p>This mod has been a labor of a long period of light tinkering, and I appreciate all the feedback I got from the community - both positive and negative. I read every post and comment about the mod on the reddit and some on the discord, and have tried to adapt the mod to provide the best possible experience.<p><p>With this new version, you all will note a major retcon in the absence of the Democrats. I didn't like making this change as it was a bit part of what made this timeline distinct, but I felt it was necessary for both gameplay and realism reasons. Starting with realism - the 'southern breakaway party' as a political feature is a result of post-Civil War Southern identity and of suppression of the black population - neither of which would exist in a world where the North seceded and the African population was deported. <p><p> For gameplay, many noted the large PV-EC splits resulting from a quarter of the country being deep safe states, and this also made a Whig 'southern strategy' functionally impossible to make work well.<p><p>Second, I removed all the CYOA from the Lipinski side, including the 'hidden' McCaskill path. I did this because at the time, these were just my experiments to have fun with code, and I don't feel they fit the theme of the mod well. In addition, I didn't want to take the time to code 3 whole other 'replacement' paths as originally planned. <p><p> I hope you all won't mind these changes too much. Please feel free to post all your comments on the reddit post or send them directly to me at /u/neonhydroxide. There will be at least one more version of this mod before I call it 'done.' <p><p>For more information, please see:<p><p><a href='https://press.umich.edu/Books/F/Founding-Factions'>Founding Factions: How Majorities Shifted and Aligned to Shape the U.S. Constitution</a> by Jeremy Pope and Shawn Treier<p><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/u9iz6t/american_national_assembly_election_2014_the/'>American National Assembly Election, 2014 - the legacy of a Southern victory at the Constitutional Convention</a> by NeonHydroxide<p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/KeNG6wv.png' width='700px'></img><p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/u7JVtQs.png' width='700px'></img></div>",
