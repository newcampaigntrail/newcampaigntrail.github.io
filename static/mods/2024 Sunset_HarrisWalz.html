              <p>Triumphant. Joe Biden was completely and utterly triumphant, a winner in every sense of the word.</p><p>It wasn’t even eleven and the race had already been called for Biden. The mood in the Naval Observatory wasn’t so much joyful as it was vindicated. The home was filled with—aside from Whitmer and her staff—the most loyal of Biden’s people: the ones that had stuck by his side through everything, the ones that experienced his sense of vindication along with him, and the ones that would continue to dutifully serve him in his second term.</p><p>It was a mandate, they were telling him, he was on track to do even better than he had in 2020. Democrats had easily taken back the House and would soon install Hakeem Jeffries as speaker, so long as Biden gave his approval—he still wasn’t sure. He hadn’t been much help when the party was plotting to overthrow him. The Senate was looking just as good. Every incumbent Democrat was on track to keep their seat, Dan Osborn was leading in Nebraska, and Ted Cruz was only half a point ahead of Colin Allred in Texas with plenty of votes left to count.</p><p>He was on top of the world. How would his second term go? It flashed before his eyes—a minimum wage increase, a public option, maybe even the ERA or a Supreme Court reform amendment—the state legislatures were looking pretty good, after all. Then it hit him. He was going to be the next LBJ—no, even better: the next FDR.</p><p>His Truman walked in. “Joe,” Whitmer said, “my staff was thinking that we should probably get going soon—the crowd’s eager to see us.”</p><p>“You go ahead, I’ll be a couple minutes. Stall if you need to, okay?”</p><p>“Alright?”</p><p>Whitmer exited the room. Biden knew that, like most people, she was a bit confused as to why he insisted on watching the results come in at the Naval Observatory. To tell the truth, Biden wasn’t entirely sure either; it was some kind of mix between honoring Kamala and the fact that he just liked the place—much more than the White House, in fact. It felt more down-to-earth, less suffocating.</p><p>Suddenly, a phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times.</p><p>One of Biden’s staffers gestured towards him. “President Obama, sir.”</p><p>“Tell him I’ll call him back later,” Biden said without hesitation. Obama thought that he could come crawling back for forgiveness after everything he did? Not a chance.</p><p>But there was one person he wanted to call. “Could you guys clear out—just for a minute? I need to make a call.”</p><p>His staff obliged, quickly leaving the living room. Once they were all out of sight, Biden took out his phone and dialed the number. He held it up to his ear.</p><p>“Joe? Why the hell are you calling me?” Although Trump’s voice was confident, Biden could still hear a trace of weariness in it.</p><p>“I just wanted to give you the opportunity to concede.”</p><p>“Quite frankly, I don’t think there’s any world in which I’m doing that—I actually won this election by a very large margin, and Crooked Joe and Barack Hussein Obama have stolen it again.”</p><p>“You’re full of shit. You know that, right?”</p><p>“Many people, many great Americans don’t seem to know that. You know, many people are saying that perhaps, when they were printing the ballots with your name on them, they slipped in some extra votes for you. I think we’re going to be looking into that very strongly, this is fraud to a tremendous degree—Crooked Joe is in charge of a failing economy yet he somehow won by even more than he supposedly did in 2020 under the Trump economy, which many economists have said was the best economy we’ve ever had, a huge improvement over the Obama disaster.”</p><p>Biden felt as if he had just had a stroke. Trump was rambling, incoherent. Was he being self-aware? Was this a bizarre attempt at humor?</p><p>“You do know you lost, right?”</p><p>“Well, if I say I won, I won. It’s quite simple, really, they’ll find the evidence for whatever I say, it’s really amazing, you know. My people have said that OAN—a great network, I’ve been told—has their own electoral map and they’re saying that Trump won, that we got so many electoral votes, a truly amazing victory that all of our wonderful patriots fought for.”</p><p>Christ. He was nonsensical. Biden wondered if this was how he sounded to people. He certainly hoped it wasn’t. “How many votes do you think you got, Donald?” he asked as if he were talking to a child.</p><p>“We had a very historic election tonight, the likes of which have never been seen before. I’m going to lie and say I won this election, and by a lot, but other people—very fabulous people—they’re saying that I won the election, so I’m really not entirely sure who’s lying.”</p><p>He definitely wasn’t joking. No, something was wrong—very wrong. But before Biden could respond, Trump started talking again.</p><p>“I’m a winner, a very successful winner, it’s because of my deals; they say I’m the greatest dealmaker to ever live and that it was my wonderful deals that saved New York City—which was a complete dump before I came in—and made it great again. I’ve been told that I’m perhaps the most successful businessman in all of New York, and that I have to deny everything and never admit when I lose because, quite frankly, I can’t lose, because I’m a winner, and winners win.”</p><p>Biden was powerless to do anything but listen as the few traces of humanity left in Roy Cohn’s monster collapsed inwards on themselves, rendering Trump a pitiful, directionless husk of a man—a failure at his one mission in life: to win no matter the cost. Biden muted Trump and pondered what had happened. Perhaps Trump was the one that actually had a stroke. Perhaps he couldn't handle the fact that he was a loser. That his sun had set.</p><p>Biden put his phone down and looked at the television—it seemed like Whitmer was about to speak. He turned the volume up.</p><p>“BIG GRETCH! BIG GRETCH! BIG GRETCH!” the crowd chanted as she walked onto the stage. Biden wasn’t sure he had ever heard one of his crowds sound that excited. But just as she was about to speak, he dropped the remote and the channel changed to some political pundit talking about how he was able to win.</p><p>“…this down-to-earth charm that just really appeals to working class voters in these Rust Belt states, not to mention the shrewd political mind and the rare ability in today’s political environment to work with the other side and still get her way.”</p><p>Her way? That wasn’t right—no, why were they talking about Whitmer? He was the one who had won, this was his mandate, why was he already yesterday’s news?</p><p>Biden looked down at his phone. Trump was still on the call. He unmuted him, hoping that perhaps there was something he could say that would calm his nerves—a method hidden in the madness. It was worth a shot, at least.</p><p>“You know, Joe,” Trump said. At least he remembered who he was talking to. “You have to have loyalty when it comes to vice presidents, absolute loyalty. Mike Pence—a total loser—wasn’t loyal, he wouldn’t do what he had to do, but he saw what happened to people who weren’t loyal, they all saw. JD used to be a Trump hater, he hated Trump for stupid reasons, he was a stupid person, but he didn’t want to be on the other side of the crowd, so he became smart. Now he’s a smart person. But Joe, I don’t think your failing party would fight for you, in fact, I think I remember them frothing at the mouth to betray you after that debate that I beat you so badly in. Quite frankly, I think they’d be happy if Gretchen Whitmer used that amendment against you…”</p><p>Biden hung up on Trump. What he said scared him. Was he insane to listen to the paranoid delusions of someone like Trump? Would Whitmer invoke the 25th if she had the opportunity? And more importantly, would anybody in the party oppose her? He didn’t know what to think. Biden closed his eyes and leaned back, feeling bitter, angry, and confused.</p>`)

              <p>Joe Biden stumbled half-awake into the Oval Office. The news—that announcement—still ringing in his head:</p><p>“We can now project that Donald Trump has defeated… Hillary Clinton… George W. Bush has secured a second term against John Kerry… Dukakis has been defeated by Bush… Walter Mondale has lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan… has beaten President Carter… Nixon has triumphed over McGovern…”</p><p>No, that wasn’t right.</p><p>“Donald Trump has defeated Kamala Harris in a landslide victory.”</p><p>Biden sighed and fell onto a couch. The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. He had obviously been prepared for Kamala to lose, but this… she had lost safe Democratic states, states that no one had bothered campaigning in for years. Trump had just won a mandate. A mandate specifically to undo every last one of his accomplishments. His legacy.</p><p>He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. With his approval rating now meaningless, there was no longer any reason to fear pardoning Hunter. Maybe he could pardon some of Trump’s other enemies to protect them from his retribution. But those wouldn’t be accomplishments. They wouldn’t be what he was remembered for.</p><p>As for Kamala, he guessed that, unless the party was foolish enough to nominate her again, this would be the end of her career in elected office. He felt bad for thinking it, but maybe it was for the best—she had just astronomically blown a completely winnable race, after all. Maybe, if not for that debate, if not for Barack and Pelosi conspiring to remove him from power, and if he had gone on to face Trump, they could’ve won. No, not could’ve. Would’ve. Biden would have defeated Trump.</p><p>But he wouldn’t have just defeated him this time around. He would’ve defeated him back in 2016, had Barack not held him back and let their worst candidate receive the nomination on a silver platter. Somehow, it had inexplicably been “her turn,” even when Biden had been there waiting for his turn for the better party of forty-four years. It had been his turn. 2020 wasn’t his time—it was his last chance.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of anybody that talking to would cause him to feel any better.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Of course Trump had called to gloat, he shouldn’t have expected anything else. At the very least, it filled him with some odd sense of pride that it was he and not Harris that Trump had first called. The phone rang again. Biden begrudgingly got to his feet and walked over to the Resolute Desk, supposing that he should probably answer it. He sat down and held the receiver to his ear.</p><p>It wasn’t Trump. “Hey, uhhh… Joe.”</p><p>Dammit. Biden wouldn’t have answered had he known it was him. “Mr. President,” he said curtly.</p><p>“I just wanted to call to, uhhh… check in with you, make sure you’re doing alright.”</p><p>“I am. Why are you actually calling me?”</p><p>Obama sighed. “Don’t be like this, Joe. I know you haven’t been doing the greatest since…”</p><p>“Since what?”</p><p>“Since you, uhhh… stepped down back in July.” The end of his sentence was abrupt, as if he had cut himself off midthought.</p><p>Biden didn’t answer. He could hardly believe the nerve this man had.</p><p>“Joe, it was for the party.”</p><p>That was it for him. “And in case you didn’t notice, Barry, we fucking lost! She got demolished! Why the hell can’t the party stop nominating people that are so terrible at this shit? This is 2016 all over again, and you know it!</p><p>“Joe, let me—”</p><p>“Trump, MAGA, all this bullshit, it’s you! It’s all your fault!”</p><p>Obama paused for a moment. “There’s another reason I’m calling,” he said, “I just want to, uhhh… warn you, Joe. The Harris campaign’s spin room is operating at full capacity right now.”</p><p>”What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“For the past couple of minutes, you’ve been telling me the story of a, uhhh… dysfunctional campaign led by an incompetent candidate,” Obama said, “but that is not the story that is about to be told on the networks. David and Kamala have no intention of taking the fall for this, uhhh… mess. You’re the scapegoat, Joe. The entire nation is about to hear about a campaign burdened with the weight of an unpopular, sabotaging sore loser that can’t handle the fact that he’s no longer the center of attention.”</p><p>Biden’s heart sank. It sounded like he would have a legacy, after all. Just not anything like what he envisioned during all those years of waiting. “Why are you telling me all of this?” Biden asked.</p><p>“Because I care about you,” he replied. Although Biden hated to admit it, his voice was genuine. “And, uhhh… before I go, I have some advice for you, Joe. If I were you, I’d start finding some allies. I, uhhh… personally would suggest the progressives—Bernie Sanders, AOC, you know them. Kamala ran a more centrist campaign than they would’ve liked, and if I know them, they’re going to blame her loss on her choice to moderate, not you.”</p><p>“Bernie Sanders,” Biden said, “I guess we have a lot in common: we’re old, the party hates us, and we both got fucked over quite a bit in 2016.”</p><p>“I’m sorry about 2016. I know that, uhhh… doesn’t really mean much now, but I am. But you can’t get hung up on the past right now.”</p><p>“Well, Barry, I’m basically in a fight for my goddamn life at the moment, so forgive me if I think about how this all could’ve been avoided.”</p><p>“I—Joe, you said it yourself, you’re in a fight for your life. A fight that you’ll lose if you let people focus on the past. You need to keep things in the, uhhh… present, on the campaign—not your administration. Let me put it this way: right now, you’re staring eastwards at an empty spot in the sky when the sun is setting behind you.”</p><p>“Really putting that Harvard education to good use, aren’t you? What a vivid metaphor. ‘when the sun is setting—’ the hell does that even mean?”</p><p>“When was the last time you weren’t thinking about the next election? The 60s? When I was in third grade? You’re nearing nightfall, Joe, and I’d hate for you to spend what little time you have left consumed by what could’ve been. You need to fight for what can be, not for what—” </p><p>Biden slammed the telephone down, cutting off whatever smartass malarkey Obama was to spout out next. He swiped it away, attempting to knock it off the desk, but it merely moved an inch or so. Biden closed his eyes and leaned back, feeling bitter, angry, and confused.</p>`)

              <p>Joe Biden stumbled half-awake into the Oval Office, the news—that announcement—still ringing in his head:</p><p>“The presidential race between… Al Gore and George W. Bush is too close to call… no results tonight… historically close… recounts have begun… unlikely to be settled on the state-level…  ”</p><p>No, that wasn’t right.</p><p>“The presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has been deadlocked, with each candidate receiving 269 electoral votes. As such, the election will go to Congress, with the House electing the president and the Senate the vice president.”</p><p>Biden sighed and fell onto a couch. The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. A tie. Hardly satisfying. At the very least, Biden thought, the whole situation could further motivate the states to abolish the electoral college. Surely they would be unhappy with Congress electing the president, right?</p><p>Biden wondered how Congress was looking—he admittedly hadn’t been paying as much attention as he probably should have to the congressional elections. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and checked. Neither chamber had been fully called yet, but it looked as if the Democrats would narrowly end up taking control of the House. The state delegations, however, still seemed to be in control of the Republicans. So Trump would end up as president.</p><p>On the Senate side of things, Tester had lost as expected, but Brown and Casey both held narrow leads. Additionally, Dan Osborn was essentially tied in Nebraska—if all three of them won and Osborn worked with the Democrats, it’d be 50–50. Enough for Kamala to break the tie and elect Walz as vice president. Biden decided to make it his mission to pull all the strings needed to get Walz elected. That’d be an actual accomplishment, a legacy to be proud of; crippling Trump’s second term with a hostile Congress and vice president.</p><p>He hadn’t given much thought to this scenario before, but come to think of it, it was probably the best possible outcome for him. Trump and Kamala had both lost, and it was he that would step in and fix things. He’d be the competent one, the adult in the room. Trump’s entire presidency would be seen as illegitimate, and Kamala would be remembered for fumbling an election that she should’ve won. That he could’ve won, had Barack and Pelosi not messed things up.</p><p>He had another thought. Had Barack not thrown his support behind Hillary, he probably would have beaten Trump in 2016. After that, he obviously would have won reelection in 2020 given how all of the Democrats’ best issues were in the spotlight, and then he’d be right back where he was, only this time after having served two full terms and becoming a real, prominent part of the party lineage.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of many people he cared enough about to answer.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Was Trump calling to gloat? Biden thought it was a bit embarrassing to brag about winning a contingent election, but regardless, it filled with some odd sense of pride that it was he and not Kamala that Trump had first called.

It’s just math—Trump will become president and Walz will probably become VP. I should be asking how you’re feeling. I doubt this was part of your master plan.”</p><p>Obama sighed. “Don’t be like this, Joe. I know you haven’t been doing the greatest since…”</p><p>“Since what?”</p><p>“Since you, uhhh… stepped down back in July.” The end of his sentence was abrupt, as if he had cut himself off midthought.</p><p>Biden didn’t answer. He could hardly believe the nerve this man had.</p><p>“Joe, it was for the party.”</p><p>“Well, congrats on landing the party in the second-worst position it could’ve found itself in. Impressive stuff. Almost as impressive as what you did back in 2016. You have a real talent for this kind of stuff, Barry.”</p><p>“That’s not—”</p><p>“You know, when you think about it, you actually managed to get Trump and MAGA elected. You started an entire movement, that’s nothing to scoff at.”</p><p>“I did not, uhhh… get Trump elected. Hillary was the one that lost—”</p><p>“And who was the one that got Hillary the nomination over more viable candidates?”</p><p>“Alright, fine. I, uhhh… supported Hillary, I thought she could win. I was mistaken.”</p><p>“And you were mistaken about Kamala as well, and I was right. And guess what, Jack, nobody’s gonna blame for all this shit the same way they would’ve if she fully lost. All the blame’s gonna fall on her for not being able to win a few thousand more votes, as well as everyone who got her here for letting this all happen.”</p><p>Obama chuckled. “You know what, Joe? You’re right. This isn’t your fault and history’s gonna look back on you, uhhh… pretty fondly. Which, at least to me, makes it even stranger that you’re spending all of your time thinking about an election from eight years ago.”</p><p>“I think it’d be a lot nicer if folks could look fondly at me now, rather than in twenty years, when I’ll have… well, you know.”</p><p>“I—Joe, you said it yourself, you’re not going to live forever.

The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. Even though they had won, it still felt like a defeat. After all, he knew full well that the pundits were likely already telling their audiences that the only reason the Democratic ticket had won was because he wasn’t on it. Is that how he’d be remembered? The man that Kamala had triumphed in spite of, not because of? What a legacy. After everything, he would go down in the history books as a placeholder, and not a particularly effective one at that.</p><p>He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. Maybe he could pardon Hunter. He thought that Kamala probably wouldn’t appreciate that, but what other choice did he have? Let Hunter go to prison over a bunch of trumped-up charges? He shook his head. He was still the president, the most powerful person on the planet, he didn’t need to concern himself with the whining of others—he was still in this.</p><p>He wondered what would happen to Trump. He doubted Kamala would keep Merrick Garland around, so there was a good chance that his federal cases would finally catch up to him, maybe even send him to prison. That’d be the end of him, unless—surely he wouldn’t run again in 2028, right? And if he did—no, of course he would lose. Of course.</p><p>All in all, he knew this was probably the best outcome for him. Probably. Part of him still wondered if he would’ve won had Barack and Pelosi not stolen the nomination from him at gunpoint. Although he knew that they would never admit it, he was pretty sure that he would’ve. He had a stronger appeal amongst blue-collar workers, moderates, Southerners, and even progressives—Bernie and AOC had been his strongest supporters in the days following that debate. Yes, surely he would have won, and probably by more.</p><p>But he wouldn’t have just defeated him this time around. He would’ve defeated him back in 2016, had Barack not held him back and let their worst candidate receive the nomination on a silver platter. Somehow, it had inexplicably been “her turn,” even when Biden had been there waiting for his turn for the better part of forty-four years.

              <p>Joe Biden stumbled half-awake into the Oval Office. The news—that announcement—still ringing in his head:</p><p>“We can now project that Donald Trump has been defeated by… Joe Biden… Mitt Romney has lost to Barack Obama… has secured a landslide victory against McCain… Dole has failed to beat Clinton… has beaten Bush… Governor Carter has triumphed over President Ford…”</p><p>No, that wasn’t right.</p><p>“Donald Trump has been defeated by Kamala Harris in a landslide loss.”</p><p>Biden sighed and fell onto a couch. The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. Even though they had won, it still felt like a defeat, at least a personal one. Kamala had won by so much… Surely, even if the party was right about his popularity, he would’ve won had he been on the ticket, right? To most people—or at least most Democrats—this was a mandate, a landslide unseen since the Obama days. But to him, it was proof that that begrudging decision he made in July was the wrong one. He had lost out on the opportunity to serve another term, and for what? To be viewed as a placeholder? Was that all?</p><p>He took a deep breath. He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. Maybe he could pardon Hunter. He thought that Kamala probably wouldn’t appreciate that, but what other choice did he have? Let Hunter go to prison over a bunch of trumped-up charges? He shook his head. He was still the president, the most powerful person on the planet, he didn’t need to concern himself with the whining of others—he was still in this. And besides, Kamala had plenty of political capital left to spend.</p><p>He wondered what would happen to Trump. He doubted Harris would keep Merrick Garland around, so there was a good chance that his federal cases would finally catch up to him, maybe even send him to prison. That’d be the end of him, unless—surely he wouldn’t run again in 2028, right? And if he did—no, of course he would lose. Of course.</p><p>Still, it felt odd to him that the best outcome for the country was perhaps the worst for him—proof that he sacrificed himself for nothing. In fact, they probably would’ve won in an even larger landslide had he been the nominee. He had a stronger appeal amongst blue-collar workers, moderates, Southerners, and even the progressives—Bernie and AOC had been his strongest supporters in the days following that debate. Yes, surely he would have won by more.</p><p>But he wouldn’t have just defeated him this time around. He would’ve defeated him back in 2016, had Barack not held him back and let their worst candidate receive the nomination on a silver platter. Somehow, it had inexplicably been “her turn,” even when Biden had been there waiting for his turn for the better party of forty-four years. It had been his turn. 2020 wasn’t his time—it was his last chance.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of anybody that talking to would cause him to feel any better.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Was Trump calling to concede? That seemed… suspicious. But regardless of Trump’s intentions, Biden felt an odd sense of pride in the fact that it  was he and not Harris that Trump had first called. The phone rang again. Biden got to his feet and walked over to the Resolute Desk, ready to hear just about anything. He sat down and held the receiver to his ear.</p><p>It wasn’t Trump. “Hey, uhhh… Joe.”</p><p>Dammit. Biden wouldn’t have answered had he known it was him. “Mr. President,” he said curtly.</p><p>“I just wanted to call to, uhhh… congratulate you on tonight’s results. I know you played a part in them.”</p><p>A part. That was all he got. “Almost as big of a part as you did,” he said sarcastically.</p><p>Obama sighed. “Don’t be like this, Joe. I know you haven’t been doing the greatest since…”</p><p>“Since what?”</p><p>“Since you, uhhh… stepped down back in July.” The end of his sentence was abrupt, as if he had cut himself off midthought.</p><p>Biden didn’t answer. He could hardly believe the nerve this man had.</p><p>“Joe, it was for the party.”</p><p>“When have you ever sacrificed something for the party, Barry?”</p><p>“Let me—”</p><p>“That’s right, never! Fucking never! And meanwhile I’m being forced to sacrifice myself over and over and fucking over again for no goddamn reason!”</p><p>“Uhhh… let me clear, Joe, there were absolutely reasons. Your polling was, well, it wasn’t good this time around, and in 2016, Hillary—”</p><p>“Hitched herself to the coattails of two politicians who knew how to seem likable? Give me a break, she didn’t do shit that I didn’t.”</p><p>“Is this really all about 2016? The 2016 from eight years ago? Joe, you won, you became president. Who cares if it was four years later?”</p><p>“I sure as hell care. MAGA would have died with Trump and I would’ve had a Congress I could’ve actually worked with, for one. I could’ve passed historic legislation, I could have been the modern day LBJ—”</p><p>Obama was still laughing. “Weren’t you ranked as the 14th best president by historians?

              <p>If one was forced to sum up the Democratic Party in a single word, it would be overconfidence. The party learned that the hard way in 2016. Then, in 2020, Joe Biden significantly underperformed the polls. Finally, in 2024, President Joe Biden sat aghast in the Oval Office as the results came in. Somehow, despite everything, Kamala had failed to defeat Donald Trump. Not only that, she had also managed to lose every single electoral vote, almost as if through divine intervention—or spite.</p><p>Biden sat still for the next few minutes as he watched his life fall apart. He sat still as he was handed a concession speech. And he sat still as Donald Trump took the stage at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>“Tonight, we have made America great again!” Trump said to wild applause.</p><p>“In a couple of months I will take office, which I have won three times—”</p><p>“NOT SO FAST!” a booming voice called out. </p><p>All of a sudden, out of absolutely nowhere, a giant portal opened over Trump and an apple pie flew out of it and whacked him in the face. Trump screamed and fell over. Then, a figure emerged from the portal: William Howard Taft.</p><p>“The president will not be disrespecting the Constitution and disobeying the judiciary on my watch!” said Taft. He then proceeded to dropkick Trump into a wall. The crowd screamed in horror and rushed onstage to attack Taft, but he was ready. In a single, swift movement, he jumped up in the air and then slammed back onto the ground bottom first, creating an earthquake that sent everybody flying.</p><p>“Now that that’s out of the way,” Taft said as he awesomely paced the stage, “I am here to announce that I intend to seek the office of president of the United States in order to safeguard it from bad actors like Mr. Trump here.” He gestured over to Trump, who was writhing in the wall like some kind of worm.</p><p>Biden was shocked. The election was over! How on earth would Taft win it? He didn’t have to wait long to find out.</p><p>“Hello viewers,” Wolf Blitzer said, jumpscaring everybody in America, “CNN has just received word that the AP has called the election for Taft, as a majority of electors have decided to go rogue and vote for Taft.”</p><p>“If anybody wishes to challenge me,” said Taft, “I invite them to—we are all Men in the Arena, after all. However, I am prepared to go All The Way, and I do not plan to fall as Icarus did. No longer will this be a Democratic nation, or a Republican nation, or an Obamanation; I Hope that I can bring an end to this American Carnage and unite these Divided States of America! As today’s youngsters say, it is important that, Now More Than Ever, I take the W. and focus on protecting our country today, not waste my second Lifetime of This thinking about Things That Never Were!”</p><p>But then, something awfully nefarious happened: Trump wormed his way out of his wormhole like the worm man he was. “Many people are saying that this is very illegal, Taft. Quite frankly, this is not fair at all because you came out of nowhere!”</p><p>Taft beamed good-naturedly at his foe. “How do you propose we settle this, Mr. Trump?”</p><p>“Golf, of course! I’m the most tremendous golf player ever to live, ask anybody.” Trump grabbed a golf that conveniently was lodged in his wormhole and pulled a ball out of his pocket. He hit the ball pathetically into a table.</p><p>“I can do better than that!” Taft said, pulling a golf club and ball out of his heaven portal. He lined up his shot, and then—wham! The ball flew out of a window and disappeared. The world fell silent for a moment or two or three or nine. Then:</p><p>“Hello, I’m Wolf Blitzer, here again,” jumpscared Wolf Blitzer, “I have more breaking news: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been assassinated with a golf ball.”</p><p>Taft started dancing skillfully and Trump started crying. He sucked at golfing and everybody in the world except for Putin now knew it. Taft then did a cool spell looking thing with his hands and Wolf Blitzer teleported from the CNN mansion to Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>“President Taft, I have a question: who will serve as your vice president?”</p><p>Taft pointed at the portal. “Oh, he’s in here.

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Tapper: Biden stalled resignation to ensure minimum wage bill passed during his presidency</h3>
              <p>Published June 27, 2026</p><p>NEW YORK — According to snippets released from CNN anchor Jake Tapper’s bombshell upcoming book, “The Remains of the Execrable,” former President Joe Biden—who, on March 29, 2026 became the second president to resign from office—resigned nearly a week after he initially planned to ensure that the Secure Wages Expansion Act passed during his presidency. The bill was signed into law on March 28, a day before Biden’s resignation.</p><p>The bill—nicknamed “Biden Bucks” by Republicans—raised the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour, with that amount set to rise with inflation. The bill was introduced in the House on March 14, 2026, by Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA), where it was quickly approved. The bill passed in the Senate on March 26, 2026, with all 49 Democrats and independent Senators Bernie Sanders, Angus King, and Dan Osborn voting in favor of it. No Republicans voted for it in either chamber of Congress. The Republican party has found itself in somewhat of a hopeless legislative position ever since Senate Majority Leader Cory Booker oversaw the abolition of the filibuster.</p><p>Although the bill was the last act of legislation signed by President Biden, it wasn’t supposed to be; Biden originally intended to resign the presidency on March 23, which would have made the bill the first bill signed into law by now-President Gretchen Whitmer. According to Tapper, Biden—who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February of 2025—grew deeply insecure and paranoid in his final months as president, especially given that then-Vice President Whitmer served as the acting president on a regular basis as Biden underwent cancer treatment.</p><p>Biden reportedly didn’t want to resign in the first place, but was left with little choice after Democrats—concerned with the amount of time he spent in cancer trearment—mounted a pressure campaign eerily similar to the one that forced Biden from the 2024 presidential race and replaced him with the late Kamala Harris. In the end, Biden told Democratic leaders that he planned to step down on March 23, but took them by surprise when he pushed his resignation back by six days in an alleged dual-effort to get another accomplishment under his belt and to spite the party leaders he felt had unfairly ousted him for a second time.</p><p>Tapper, however, casts doubt on this dual-effort theory in The Remains of the Execrable, suggesting that the inconsistencies between Biden’s planned resignation and his actual resignation were not because of spite, but because of Biden’s severe mental decline. Indeed, the first half of the book covers Biden’s decline and the efforts of those around him to hide it. Tapper has said that he soon plans to release an excerpt regarding Biden’s 2024 victory party, which Biden arrived ten minutes late to. According to reports, Biden dismissed all of his staff and sat in the Naval Observatory living room for ten minutes, seemingly doing nothing.</p><p>Situations like this, Tapper has said, are what makes it important that “brave journalists such as [himself] are around to inform the American public.” A spokesperson for former President Biden strongly denied Tapper’s claims, calling them “ludicrous,” and saying that “anybody who has been around President Biden knows full well that Jake Tapper’s hallucinated mental declines are completely false.”</p><p>Republicans in Congress have jumped on the accusations, with many calling for an impeachment inquiry into President Whitmer for allegedly concealing Biden’s health from the public, an accusation that the White House has strongly denied. “This is only a distraction from President Whitmer’s literally groundbreaking work in revamping our nation’s highway and railroad system,” a spokesperson for Whitmer told CNN on Tuesday.</p><p>This is the second excerpt that Tapper has released. The first excerpt, released on June 3, was about the widely covered incident at former President Trump’s funeral in February, where Biden repeatedly ignored former President Obama, who seemed to try multiple times to start a conversation with him. Tapper argues that Biden’s mental decline had advanced to a stage so severe that he was no longer entirely cognisant of where he was or who was around him, leading him to not realize Obama was attempting to speak with him. Biden allies have counterargued that Biden simply didn’t wish to speak to Obama.</p><p>The Remains of the Execrable releases worldwide on July 21, 2026, the two-year anniversary of Biden’s (temporary) withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.</p>`)

              <p>Published December 28, 2025</p><p>CHICAGO — Following Illinois’s highly publicized arrest of Attorney General Matt Gaetz, Governor JB Pritzker has experienced a surge in 2028 Democratic primary polls.</p><p>According to a poll conducted by AtlasIntel two days after the arrest, 32% of Democratic voters now say they support Pritzker for president, with 21% supporting former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, 16% supporting Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 8% supporting California Governor Gavin Newsom, and 15% saying they were unsure.</p><p>The results came as somewhat of a shock for many in the party, given that Pritzker was only polling at 2% in a poll released by AtlasIntel in September. Pritzker has been a polarizing figure in the party as of late, with his arrest of Matt Gaetz for alleged Concealment of Homicidal Death drawing both support and anxiety from many in leadership positions. DNC Chair Ben Wikler—a supporter of Pritzker’s move—could not be reached for comment.</p><p>Gaetz’s arrest has been a dramatic escalation in what was already a reportedly deeply disorganized and chaotic tenure as attorney general. Gaetz was confirmed by the Senate for the role on February 4, 2025 in a 50–50 vote, with all Democrats and Republican Senators Collins, Curtis, McConnell, Murkowski, and Tillis voting against his confirmation, citing his perceived lack of experience and alleged sex crimes. Gaetz has presided over numerous controversial DOJ actions, including the attempted prosecutions of former Vice Presidents Harris, Pence, and Gore—all of which were dismissed by grand juries—and the federal case against alleged UnitedHealthcare shooter Luigi Mangione, which was dismissed by a judge after Gaetz very vocally called for Mangione to be executed.</p><p>Gaetz’s arrest stems from an incident on December 13 that involved FBI agents under Gaetz’s command and ICE agents under Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s. Spokespeople for the FBI and ICE claim the agencies were working to capture and deport dangerous drug dealers operating out of a southwestern Chicago neighborhood (although the two agencies have released no evidence of a drug ring) when a fleeing target shot at and lit a taco truck on fire, destroying it and killing its owner, a 58-year-old Mexican immigrant.</p><p>Illinois State Police, however, allege that several FBI agents attempted to break into the truck in an effort to arrest its owner. When they failed, they claim, the agents opened fire, hitting an electrical wire and lighting the truck on fire. Videos taken by spectators seem to show the agents in question doing nothing to stop the fire, and instead guarding the doors of the vehicle. The FBI claims that the agents were worried that the shooter, who they say escaped, was hiding behind or in the vehicle, ready to attack if they got too close. Illinois State Police denied the FBI’s account and suggested Thursday that the alleged shooter might not have existed.</p><p>After the fire, the FBI—under the instruction of Gaetz—is alleged by Illinois to have covered up the fact that a man died in the truck in an attempt to salvage the agency’s already damaged reputation. This allegation led to Illinois issuing an arrest warrant for Gaetz on December 22. The following day, Gaetz appeared to mock the warrant by flying to Chicago for a podcast interview. Gaetz was arrested on his way to the taping by Illinois State Police. Gaetz’s bail is currently set at twenty-million dollars, which the DOJ has refused to pay, calling Gaetz’s arrest “a seditious sham.”</p><p>This is not the first time Pritzker has been involved in a situation like this. In August of this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an arrest warrant for Pritzker after he provided a place for Texas Democrats fleeing the state to slow down its gerrymandering efforts to stay. Pritzker retaliated by issuing an arrest warrant for Abbott for human trafficking, seemingly in connection with his immigration policies.</p><p>President Trump slammed the arrest, saying “Governor Pritzker… not a great guy, right? This stuff with Matt is very sad, but maybe prison will be good for him… he was a weird guy, they say, I’m not sure if that’s true or not but many people seem to think it.”</p>`)

              <p>Published November 19, 2025</p><p>WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, the Senate unanimously passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, sending it to President Trump to sign. The House overwhelmingly voted in favor of the bill the previous day, with only Representative Clay Higgins (R-LA) voting against it.</p><p>Although the bill—sponsored by Representatives Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA)—stalled for weeks after its introduction and subsequent holding up in committee, it was able to make it to a floor vote after Representative Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) was sworn in to office on November 12 and served as the final signature on a discharge petition to force a floor vote.</p><p>The discharge petition was previously signed by every Democrat and Republican Representatives Massie, Boebert, Greene, and Mace. President Donald Trump—originally an opponent of the bill—suddenly swapped his position on the bill after the discharge petition passed, encouraging Republicans to vote for the bill. Every Republican, with the exception of Higgins, would end up voting for the bill in the end.</p><p>Calls to release the Epstein files have in many ways consumed the Trump presidency since Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that the rumored Epstein client list didn’t exist back in July. Many of Trump’s opponents have attacked the president’s unwillingness to release the files, suggesting that he was covering for influential plans or was in the files himself, a suspicion only furthered after it was revealed that FBI agents reportedly scoured the files for every mention of Trump.</p><p>The scandal only escalated after the release of a birthday letter Trump is said to have written to Epstein in 2003, which depicted an imaginary conversation between Trump and Epstein including a reference to a “wonderful secret” drawn inside the outline of a naked woman. 	Trump denied the letter was real and suggested it was a hoax created by his political opponents.</p><p>Then, earlier this month, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a trove of emails between Epstein and various figures, including Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and Noam Chomsky. In one email, Epstein called Trump “the dog that never barked.” In another, Epstein seems to claim that he met with high-ranking Russian officials to discuss Trump before the 2016 election, leading many to suspect that Epstein provided Russia with blackmail material on Trump.</p><p>It’s unclear how exactly the release of the Epstein files will go; the Department of Justice still has thirty days to prepare for their release, during which they may redact portions of the files. Some political commentators have also suggested that the DOJ might use the recent investigation launched into former President Bill Clinton’s ties with Epstein to avoid releasing the files, as they could be classified as being part of an active investigation. </p><p>If one thing’s for certain, though, it’s that release or no release, Trump is unlikely to be able to fully put this scandal behind him, especially given that he campaigned on transparency on this issue during the 2024 election. Since Jeffrey Epstein, his death, and the files have triggered numerous conspiracy theories, this message ended up resonating with more conspiratorly-minded groups in his base. Now, a year later, his base is perhaps more suspicious than ever before and traditionally less conspiratorly-minded Democratic voters have started adopting Epstein conspiracy theories, mainly involving their suspicions about Trump’s friendship with Epstein and the perceived suspicious circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide in 2019.</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Tim Walz impeachment effort meets embarrassing end in the House</h3>
              <p>Published April 7, 2027</p><p>WASHINGTON — Republican efforts to impeach Vice President Tim Walz came to an end Wednesday afternoon, with the House rejecting the single article of impeachment filed against Walz in a major blow to President Trump, Speaker of the House Kevin Hern, and Senate Minority Leader John Thune. The impeachment was widely expected to pass in the Republican-controlled House; political betting platform Polymarket showed 76% odds of Walz getting impeached before the vote began.</p><p>The final vote was 217–215 against the impeachment. Every Democrat as well as eleven Republicans voted against the impeachment, while the remaining 215 Republicans voted in favor of it. The article of impeachment, sponsored by Representative Andy Ogles (R-TN), accuses Walz of committing perjury during a Congressional hearing on widespread welfare fraud during Walz’s tenure as Minnesota’s governor.</p><p>The alleged perjury in question is based on Walz’s answer to a question from Senator Tommy Tuberville regarding his knowledge of “widespread daycare fraud run by Somalian enemies of the state and associates with terrorist groups such as ISIS,” to which Walz replied, “Senator, I have no knowledge of the existence of such an honestly bizarre thing now, so I have no idea how the hell I was supposed to know about when I was governor.”</p><p>The article of impeachment claims that such a plot did in fact exist and that Walz knew about it and covered it up so as not to hurt himself politically. Several experts on the matter—including a federal prosecutor involved in the proven welfare fraud case—have cast doubt on the allegations, while conservative influencers have suggested the fraud may run even deeper than Tuberville and Ogles have alleged.</p><p> For busy Americans, it can be difficult to know who exactly to trust. Polls have found approval of the impeachment largely split along party lines, with one poll by Emerson College finding that 83% of Republicans and just 2% of Democrats were in favor of the impeachment. Only 34% of independents were found to support it. Among its most vocal supporters are President Trump—who has reportedly been growing increasingly frustrated with Walz’s attempts to invoke the 25th Amendment—Secretary of Education JD Vance, Secretary of Health and Human Services Mehmet Oz, Secretary of Defense Ron DeSantis, and FBI Director Sarah Palin.</p><p>Walz—who is seen as the presumptive Democratic nominee, with only former Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and sports analyst Stephen A. Smith having entered the race against him—has vigorously denied the charges, calling them “complete bullshit, all of them.” In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Walz said “It’s just bullshit. I don’t know how else to describe it. These people just made up a bunch of fake charges to smear me ahead of the election, which they incorrectly thought would pass in their gerrymandered to hell House.”</p><p>Walz was referring to criticism of Congressional maps drawn up by many Republican states, which were created with the apparent intention of removing Democratic districts so as to reclaim a House majority. They achieved this after the Supreme Court struck down efforts by Democratic states such as California to counter their redistricting by drawing up new maps of their own; before the midterms, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. The Republicans reclaimed control of the House in the midterms, although they lost Senate seats in North Carolina, Maine, and Alaska to Democratic challengers, bringing Democrats’ majority in the Senate up to 53 seats.</p><p>As of publication, it’s unclear what exactly prompted so many Republican defections on the impeachment vote, as the defectors have largely avoided the press. President Trump has called for them to be challenged in their respective primaries in 2028. One possible reason put forward by many to explain the no votes is that they, mostly representing close districts, were worried about supporting an unpopular impeachment before an election that is shaping up to be a blue wave.</p><p>A recent New York Times/Sienna poll put Walz beating the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump Junior, by eight points in the popular vote and winning the traditionally Republican states of Florida, Ohio, and Texas. For the most part, the other Republican candidates aren’t faring well either. Senator Josh Hawley trails Walz by ten points in a hypothetical matchup, while Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk trails him by twelve. The only Republican currently polling somewhat close to Walz is former Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who trails Walz by four points. Additionally, every Republican’s numbers dip further when 2024 independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Junior is included.</p>`)

Kennedy’s entrance turns the election into a five-man race, with Kennedy, Cuomo, and Mayor Eric Adams running against the Democratic and Republican nominees, Zohran Mamdani and Curtis Sliwa respectively.</p><p>In an announcement video posted on X—formerly Twitter—Kennedy said that “corrupt special interests have taken over [New York City’s] City Hall under the direct supervision of Mayor Adams. I’m not happy with Mayor Adams and I don't think New York is either. But at the moment, there aren’t any other good options, options that will fight for our safety and well-being. Right now, you can have your choice of a crook, a predator, a socialist, or a vigilante. That is why I intend to seek the Office of Mayor of New York City.”</p><p>The announcement came as little shock, as Kennedy had been teasing a possible run for months beforehand. Every other campaign has so far had differing approaches on how to deal with Kennedy’s entrance; Adams’s campaign attacked him for not living in New York City until a month prior, Mamdani’s attacked his support of Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and Cuomo’s attacked his anti-vaccine stances. Sliwa’s campaign has yet to respond, but one New York Republican official speaking anonymously said that “We just can’t believe that Republicans are seriously considering voting for this freak. I mean, just look at him! Fucking look at him! He’s a goddamn Kennedy, him wanting to give little kids measles doesn’t change the fact that he’s a liberal! Christ!”</p><p>Kennedy has shunned the labels of “liberal” and “conservative,” instead opting to present himself as a bipartisan outsider committed to taking on special interests, an approach that has found limited success due to Kennedy’s position as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy; hardly an outsider, his detractors have argued.</p><p>The rollout of Kennedy’s campaign has been somewhat less orderly than he likely hoped, in part because of the infamous bear story, which almost immediately reached the trending tabs on numerous social media sites after his announcement, including X and Bluesky. For those unaware, Kennedy claimed to have discovered a dead bear cub while driving back in 2014. He put the bear cub in his car and planned to place it in a refrigerator to eat at a later date. However, Kennedy found himself without time to bring the cub to his residence, so he instead opted to leave it in Central Park, putting a bicycle in front of it so as to make it look like it was with the bike.</p><p>The story is one of many involving Kennedy and strange experiences with animals; Kennedy also had part of his brain eaten by a worm, and is alleged to have eaten a dead dog in South Korea and sawed off a whale head at a beach. Kennedy has already attracted the ire of one of his opponents for his unusual eating habits: Republican Curtis Sliwa, told reporters Monday that “If that piece of shit Bobby Kennedy Jr. tries to eat of my cats, I swear, I will fucking rip what remains of his brains out—you have my word.”</p><p>Polls released before Kennedy’s announcement show varied results. One poll, conducted by Emerson College on July 5th, shows Mamdani receiving 53%, Cuomo 26%, Kennedy 9%, Sliwa 7%, and Adams 5%. Another poll, conducted by AtlasIntel on July 12th, shows Mamdani receiving 46%, Cuomo 21%, Kennedy 19%, Sliwa 8%, and Adams 6%.</p><p>Members of the Cuomo campaign have reportedly been panicked over the possibility of a Kennedy run, fearing that he would further split the anti-Mamdani vote, a probable outcome based on the polls. Meanwhile, members of Mamdani’s campaign have reportedly been eagerly awaiting Kennedy’s announcement, believing that it would divide the anti-Mamdani field while portraying Mamdani as the only normal candidate in the race.</p><p>The White House has remained relatively quiet on the mayor’s race, although White House insiders claimed back in May that members of Kamala Harris’s administration were quietly urging donors to line up behind Andrew Cuomo’s ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination. President Harris was never alleged to have been involved and reportedly backed New York City Comptroller Brad Lander. Backlash to the party establishment has been credited by many commentators as having boosted Mamdani’s momentum in the weeks leading up to the primary. In the end, Mamdani won with 59.14% of the vote to Cuomo’s 40.86%.</p>`)

              <p>Published October 10, 2026</p><p>OSLO — The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced Friday that they would be awarding the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize to Secretary of State Pete Buttigieg for his role in brokering the historic treaty between Israel and Hamas that ended the Gaza War and established a United States-recognized Palestinian state.</p><p>The treaty took effect on November 5, 2025, the one-year anniversary of the 2024 election, which saw then-Vice President Kamala Harris defeat former President Donald Trump in a landslide victory. Since then, the Harris administration has had a decent amount of success, with the aforementioned treaty and the codification of Roe v. Wade being amongst her largest accomplishments.</p><p>Some may wonder then—and indeed, many have—why Buttigieg received the award rather than Harris. The answer, as it always seems to, lies in politics. When Harris took office in January of 2025, the Gaza War was still raging and progressives were still—despite efforts from former President Biden—largely disillusioned with the Democrats’ response to casualties in Gaza. According to anonymous White House and State Department sources, the president worried that involving herself too heavily in the conflict could lead to ruptures in her population, leading her to delegate ceasefire negotiations to Secretary Buttigieg.</p><p>Unfortunately for Harris, her aversion to the issue might have cost her the Nobel Peace Prize. A statement by the Norwegian Nobel Committee released alongside the announcement praised Buttigieg for his “calm and steady leadership… as well as a strong ability to convince others, have brought a hopeful peace to a frequently unhopeful region.” The statement did not mention President Harris, former President Biden, Vice President Walz, or any other American government official.</p><p>As mentioned before, the treaty ended the Gaza War and established a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Additionally, it ordered that Hamas cede control of the Palestinian government and allow a more moderate Palestinian regulatory board under UN supervision to take control of the country until elections can be held. The treaty has near-universal support, with only Israel rejecting it when it was initially proposed.</p><p>Although many Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have heavily criticized the treaty, it was still agreed upon by Israel in the end, which claimed that it was “happy to see an end to this war and the removal of Hamas from rightful Israeli territory,” seemingly attempting to imply the treaty gave Israel control of Gaza, which it did not.</p><p>Many international political commentators have speculated that Israel’s grudging acceptance of the treaty stems from the large Democratic gains in the US Congress in 2024, which saw Democrats take control of the House of Representatives and keep their 51-seat Senate majority. One of the first actions taken by the new Congress after President Harris was sworn in was to greatly cut the number of arm shipments to Israel, throwing a large wrench in their war plans.</p><p>Many Israeli officials hoped to wait until after the US 2026 midterms before agreeing to any sort of ceasefire, believing that Israel-friendly Republicans might take control of Congress. However, with more than a year remaining and morale dwindling, Israel agreed to the treaty in November. The results of the midterms are unlikely to change anything, especially given that recent polls show Democrats likely keeping their Senate majority and the House being a tossup.</p><p>Former President Donald Trump, who is currently under house arrest for his role in January 6 Capitol Insurrection, has sharply criticized the treaty, writing on Truth Social: “This ‘treaty’ is a terrible deal that proves that Comrade Kamala, who I beat in 2024, and BY A LOT, hates our Wonderful Ally of Israel so much.” Of Buttigieg, he wrote: “Pushover Pete, or as I like to call him, Alfred E. Neuman, is a total loser whose Dangerous Ideas are going to drive Israel, and perhaps even The World, into World War IV! [sic]”</p><p>Trump, who lost in a landslide in the 2024 election, is widely speculated to be plotting a fourth consecutive presidential run, although recent polling shows him only performing ten points ahead of former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in a hypothetical Republican primary matchup, while losing the popular vote by six points against Harris. The same poll had Haley trailing Harris by four points, in comparison.</p><p>In a separate poll by CBS, Americans were asked whether or not they approved of a variety of political figures. Former President Barack Obama placed highest, with a 57% approval rating, while Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, placed lowest, with a 32% approval rating. Trump was shown as having a 39% approval rating. Out of members of the Harris administration, Vice President Walz placed highest, with a 50% approval rating, followed by Buttigieg’s 48% and Harris’s 46%. Former President Biden saw a slight uptick in favorability, managing to achieve a 40% approval rating.</p>`)

              <p>Published September 30, 2044</p><p>STAMFORD — Vice President and Democratic nominee for president Joe Lieberman has landed in some hot water after his private Reddit account was found by a staffer and leaked to the press. Lieberman has yet to respond to the story, causing many in the party to call on Lieberman to step aside and let vice presidential nominee Eugene McCarthy take over.</p><p>The scandal revolves around Lieberman’s Reddit account, “u/Lieberlips4000,” which Lieberman used to post on a subreddit, r/thecampaigntrail, which is based on a browser game where the player can play as candidates in a variety of “scenarios.”</p><p>Lieberman reportedly liked to use his account to praise the creator of a scenario called “2008: The Liebercain Trail,” who he called “a true visionary… never have words been sculpted so elegantly into love—true love. It is the most beautiful thing two eyes can read, thank you. You have no idea what this means to me.” The creator of the scenario, a moderator of the subreddit who previously told MS LATER that he created the scenario as an April Fool’s joke by request of the subreddit, could not be reached for comment.</p><p>In the scenario, the player plays as either then-Arizona Senator John McCain or Lieberman. The scenario takes place in 2008 in an alternate universe where McCain picked Lieberman rather than Sarah Palin for vice president. It seems to be impossible to actually win the 2008 election against Barack Obama as the McCain-Lieberman ticket, but this is “all made up for” (according to u/Lieberlips4000) by the fact that a playthrough of either man’s path will result in McCain and Lieberman making out, with how liberal/conservative the player’s actions are changing which room they do so in. Governor McCain also could not be reached for comment.</p><p>This scandal puts a significant damper on the Gore administration, which has struggled in recent months; due to reckless spending that resulted in the complete eradication of global warming, the Lockbox’s surplus has fallen to just $67 trillion dollars.</p><p>At press time, u/Lieberlips4000 made another post in r/thecampaigntrail expressing annoyance of his portrayal in another scenario, W., as well as its sequels, X., Y., and Z., all of which follow former President George W. Bush in increasingly bizarre alternate history situations (they are, in  order: if 9/11 never happened, if Bush was fooled again, if 2002–2004 was a musical episode, and if Poppy was proud of Dubya). Bush is the older brother of Republican nominee for president Jeb Bush, as well as a good friend of Jeb’s running mate, Nelson Rockefeller.</p>`)

              <p>Posted January 20, 2057</p><p>Wow. I cannot believe I am writing this, but I love Chuck Schumer. At least as much as a persecuted MAGA “holdover” such as myself can. As every other man in the Democratic party has knelt down on all fours and accepted the Devil as their false prophet that shall lead them to the end of days, Schumer said “NOT ON MY WATCH!”</p><p> I am talking, of course, about the Satanic and unholy incident that occurred at “President” Chappell Roan’s inauguration. You see, Lady Lucifer could not just get inaugurated normally after she stole the election from Governor Morgan Wallen. No, she had to rub it into all of us traditional fighters that our lifestyles have been completely and utterly destroyed. We have not had a single president on our side since Trump had the 2020 election stolen from him, and then Taft stole the 2024 election under a false pretext of  “saving America” and “Trump’s 538-state sweep was impossible, he clearly cheated.”</p><p>Chappell “Hellfire” Roan made everyone wear drag to her inauguration. And every single goddamn Democratic piece of SCUM did so. President Joe Biden—after de-aging himself forty years in the heaven portal, stealing the 2052 election from President Trump 306–232, and serving four more years he didn’t deserve—became “Dark Brandi,” Bernie Sanders became “Miss Medi Care Fourall,” and RFK became “Kennedy Kenosis.”</p><p>But one man didn’t. One brave, heroic soul showed up to Satan’s lair in a suit, tie, and most importantly, God’s clothing: PANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That man is Chuck Schumer. Chuck Schumer is a manly angelic man and refused to become a devilish drag demon. He faced scorn for refusing to swap out his masculine shoes for sparkling heels and his trousers for a tutu. But nevertheless he persisted, even after President Roan herself lit his senate majority leader office on fire with a flaming wig and installed Senator Travis Kelce as majority leader. I think Woodrow Wilson said it best on Nick Fuentes’s podcast last week: “We cannot allow the rot of femininity to consume our great race of men.”</p><p>He’s a hero amongst men. Maybe the only real man left. As such, I plan to start a new party, called the “He-Man Woman-Haters Club” and put Chuck Schumer in charge. I am also happy to announce my new 7-book epic series starring Duck Shoemer, a shoemaking duck that turns into a handsome piece of muscles after a spell from the evil rainbow witch backfires. Then he meets this other handsome manly man and they team up and cuddle and then I—sorry, I mean the other man—embraces him in a manly straight way and we save the world together.</p><p>Thank you, Chuck!</p>`)
