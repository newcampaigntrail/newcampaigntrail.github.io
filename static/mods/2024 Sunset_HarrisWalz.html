Joe Biden was completely and utterly triumphant, a winner in every sense of the word.</p><p>It wasn’t even eleven and the race had already been called for Biden. The mood in the Naval Observatory wasn’t so much joyful as it was vindicated. The home was filled with—aside from Whitmer and her staff—the most loyal of Biden’s people: the ones that had stuck by his side through everything, the ones that experienced his sense of vindication along with him, and the ones that would continue to dutifully serve him in his second term.</p><p>It was a mandate, they were telling him, he was on track to do even better than he had in 2020. Democrats had easily taken back the House and would soon install Hakeem Jeffries as speaker, so long as Biden gave his approval—he still wasn’t sure. He hadn’t been much help when the party was plotting to overthrow him. The Senate was looking just as good. Every incumbent Democrat was on track to keep their seat, Dan Osborn was leading in Nebraska, and Ted Cruz was only half a point ahead of Colin Allred in Texas with plenty of votes left to count.</p><p>He was on top of the world. How would his second term go? It flashed before his eyes—a minimum wage increase, a public option, maybe even the ERA or a Supreme Court reform amendment—the state legislatures were looking pretty good, after all. Then it hit him. He was going to be the next LBJ—no, even better: the next FDR.</p><p>His Truman walked in. “Joe,” Whitmer said, “my staff was thinking that we should probably get going soon—the crowd’s eager to see us.”</p><p>“You go ahead, I’ll be a couple minutes. Stall if you need to, okay?”</p><p>“Alright?”</p><p>Whitmer exited the room. Biden knew that, like most people, she was a bit confused as to why he insisted on watching the results come in at the Naval Observatory. To tell the truth, Biden wasn’t entirely sure either; it was some kind of mix between honoring Kamala and the fact that he just liked the place—much more than the White House, in fact. It felt more down-to-earth, less suffocating.</p><p>Suddenly, a phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times.</p><p>One of Biden’s staffers gestured towards him. “President Obama, sir.”</p><p>“Tell him I’ll call him back later,” Biden said without hesitation. Obama thought that he could come crawling back for forgiveness after everything he did? Not a chance.</p><p>But there was one person he wanted to call. “Could you guys clear out—just for a minute? I need to make a call.”</p><p>His staff obliged, quickly leaving the living room. Once they were all out of sight, Biden took out his phone and dialed the number. He held it up to his ear.</p><p>“Joe? Why the hell are you calling me?” Although Trump’s voice was confident, Biden could still hear a trace of weariness in it.</p><p>“I just wanted to give you the opportunity to concede.”</p><p>“Quite frankly, I don’t think there’s any world in which I’m doing that—I actually won this election by a very large margin, and Crooked Joe and Barack Hussein Obama have stolen it again.”</p><p>“You’re full of shit. You know that, right?”</p><p>“Many people, many great Americans don’t seem to know that. You know, many people are saying that perhaps, when they were printing the ballots with your name on them, they slipped in some extra votes for you. I think we’re going to be looking into that very strongly, this is fraud to a tremendous degree—Crooked Joe is in charge of a failing economy yet he somehow won by even more than he supposedly did in 2020 under the Trump economy, which many economists have said was the best economy we’ve ever had, a huge improvement over the Obama disaster.”</p><p>Biden felt as if he had just had a stroke. Trump was rambling, incoherent. Was he being self-aware? Was this a bizarre attempt at humor?</p><p>“You do know you lost, right?”</p><p>“Well, if I say I won, I won. It’s quite simple, really, they’ll find the evidence for whatever I say, it’s really amazing, you know. My people have said that OAN—a great network, I’ve been told—has their own electoral map and they’re saying that Trump won, that we got so many electoral votes, a truly amazing victory that all of our wonderful patriots fought for.”</p><p>Christ. He was nonsensical. Biden wondered if this was how he sounded to people. He certainly hoped it wasn’t. “How many votes do you think you got, Donald?” he asked as if he were talking to a child.</p><p>“We had a very historic election tonight, the likes of which have never been seen before. I’m going to lie and say I won this election, and by a lot, but other people—very fabulous people—they’re saying that I won the election, so I’m really not entirely sure who’s lying.”</p><p>He definitely wasn’t joking. No, something was wrong—very wrong. But before Biden could respond, Trump started talking again.</p><p>“I’m a winner, a very successful winner, it’s because of my deals; they say I’m the greatest dealmaker to ever live and that it was my wonderful deals that saved New York City—which was a complete dump before I came in—and made it great again. I’ve been told that I’m perhaps the most successful businessman in all of New York, and that I have to deny everything and never admit when I lose because, quite frankly, I can’t lose, because I’m a winner, and winners win.”</p><p>Biden was powerless to do anything but listen as the few traces of humanity left in Roy Cohn’s monster collapsed inwards on themselves, rendering Trump a pitiful, directionless husk of a man—a failure at his one mission in life: to win no matter the cost. Biden muted Trump and pondered what had happened. Perhaps Trump was the one that actually had a stroke. Perhaps he couldn't handle the fact that he was a loser. That his sun had set.</p><p>Biden put his phone down and looked at the television—it seemed like Whitmer was about to speak. He turned the volume up.</p><p>“BIG GRETCH! BIG GRETCH! BIG GRETCH!” the crowd chanted as she walked onto the stage. Biden wasn’t sure he had ever heard one of his crowds sound that excited. But just as she was about to speak, he dropped the remote and the channel changed to some political pundit talking about how he was able to win.</p><p>“…this down-to-earth charm that just really appeals to working class voters in these Rust Belt states, not to mention the shrewd political mind and the rare ability in today’s political environment to work with the other side and still get her way.”</p><p>Her way? That wasn’t right—no, why were they talking about Whitmer? He was the one who had won, this was his mandate, why was he already yesterday’s news?</p><p>Biden looked down at his phone. Trump was still on the call. He unmuted him, hoping that perhaps there was something he could say that would calm his nerves—a method hidden in the madness. It was worth a shot, at least.</p><p>“You know, Joe,” Trump said. At least he remembered who he was talking to. “You have to have loyalty when it comes to vice presidents, absolute loyalty. Mike Pence—a total loser—wasn’t loyal, he wouldn’t do what he had to do, but he saw what happened to people who weren’t loyal, they all saw. JD used to be a Trump hater, he hated Trump for stupid reasons, he was a stupid person, but he didn’t want to be on the other side of the crowd, so he became smart. Now he’s a smart person. But Joe, I don’t think your failing party would fight for you, in fact, I think I remember them frothing at the mouth to betray you after that debate that I beat you so badly in. Quite frankly, I think they’d be happy if Gretchen Whitmer used that amendment against you…”</p><p>Biden hung up on Trump. What he said scared him. Was he insane to listen to the paranoid delusions of someone like Trump? Would Whitmer invoke the 25th if she had the opportunity? And more importantly, would anybody in the party oppose her? He didn’t know what to think. Biden closed his eyes and leaned back, feeling bitter, angry, and confused.</p>";

The party learned that the hard way in 2016. Then, in 2020, Joe Biden significantly underperformed the polls. Finally, in 2024, President Joe Biden sat aghast in the Oval Office as the results came in. Somehow, despite everything, Kamala had failed to defeat Donald Trump. Not only that, she had also managed to lose every single electoral vote, almost as if through divine intervention—or spite.</p><p>Biden sat still for the next few minutes as he watched his life fall apart. He sat still as he was handed a concession speech. And he sat still as Donald Trump took the stage at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>“Tonight, we have made America great again!” Trump said to wild applause.</p><p>“In a couple of months I will take office, which I have won three times—”</p><p>“NOT SO FAST!” a booming voice called out. </p><p>All of a sudden, out of absolutely nowhere, a giant portal opened over Trump and an apple pie flew out of it and whacked him in the face. Trump screamed and fell over. Then, a figure emerged from the portal: William Howard Taft.</p><p>“The president will not be disrespecting the Constitution and disobeying the judiciary on my watch!” said Taft. He then proceeded to dropkick Trump into a wall. The crowd screamed in horror and rushed onstage to attack Taft, but he was ready. In a single, swift movement, he jumped up in the air and then slammed back onto the ground bottom first, creating an earthquake that sent everybody flying.</p><p>“Now that that’s out of the way,” Taft said as he awesomely paced the stage, “I am here to announce that I intend to seek the office of president of the United States in order to safeguard it from bad actors like Mr. Trump here.” He gestured over to Trump, who was writhing in the wall like some kind of worm.</p><p>Biden was shocked. The election was over! How on earth would Taft win it? He didn’t have to wait long to find out.</p><p>“Hello viewers,” Wolf Blitzer said, jumpscaring everybody in America, “CNN has just received word that the AP has called the election for Taft, as a majority of electors have decided to go rogue and vote for Taft.”</p><p>“If anybody wishes to challenge me,” said Taft, “I invite them to—we are all Men in the Arena, after all. However, I am prepared to go All The Way, and I do not plan to fall as Icarus did. No longer will this be a Democratic nation, or a Republican nation, or an Obamanation; I Hope that I can bring an end to this American Carnage and unite these Divided States of America! As today’s youngsters say, it is important that, Now More Than Ever, I take the W. and focus on protecting our country today, not waste my second Lifetime of This thinking about Things That Never Were!”</p><p>But then, something awfully nefarious happened: Trump wormed his way out of his wormhole like the worm man he was. “Many people are saying that this is very illegal, Taft. Quite frankly, this is not fair at all because you came out of nowhere!”</p><p>Taft beamed good-naturedly at his foe. “How do you propose we settle this, Mr. Trump?”</p><p>“Golf, of course! I’m the most tremendous golf player ever to live, ask anybody.” Trump grabbed a golf that conveniently was lodged in his wormhole and pulled a ball out of his pocket. He hit the ball pathetically into a table.</p><p>“I can do better than that!” Taft said, pulling a golf club and ball out of his heaven portal. He lined up his shot, and then—wham! The ball flew out of a window and disappeared. The world fell silent for a moment or two or three or nine. Then:</p><p>“Hello, I’m Wolf Blitzer, here again,” jumpscared Wolf Blitzer, “I have more breaking news: Russian President Vladimir Putin has been assassinated with a golf ball.”</p><p>Taft started dancing skillfully and Trump started crying. He sucked at golfing and everybody in the world except for Putin now knew it. Taft then did a cool spell looking thing with his hands and Wolf Blitzer teleported from the CNN mansion to Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>“President Taft, I have a question: who will serve as your vice president?”</p><p>Taft pointed at the portal. “Oh, he’s in here. Would you come out and greet the nation, Senator Byrd?”</p>";

Bush has secured a second term against John Kerry… Dukakis has been defeated by Bush… Walter Mondale has lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan… has beaten President Carter… Nixon has triumphed over McGovern…”</p><p>No, that wasn’t right.</p><p>“Donald Trump has defeated Kamala Harris.”</p><p>Biden sighed and fell onto a couch. The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. He had obviously known that this was a possibility, even the most probable outcome. That didn’t stop it from hurting, though. On January 20th, Donald Trump would be sworn in as the 47th president and likely proceed to undo most of Biden’s accomplishments. His legacy.</p><p>He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. With his approval rating now meaningless, there was no longer any reason to fear pardoning Hunter. Maybe he could pardon some of Trump’s other enemies to protect them from his retribution. But those wouldn’t be accomplishments. They wouldn’t be what he was remembered for.</p><p>As for Kamala, he guessed that, unless the party was foolish enough to nominate her again, this would be the end of her career in elected office. He felt bad for thinking it, but maybe it was for the best—she had just blown a completely winnable race, after all. Maybe, if not for that debate, if not for Barack and Pelosi conspiring to remove him from power, and if he had gone on to face Trump, they could’ve won. No, not could’ve. Would’ve. Biden would have defeated Trump.</p><p>But he wouldn’t have just defeated him this time around. He would’ve defeated him back in 2016, had Barack not held him back and let their worst candidate receive the nomination on a silver platter. Somehow, it had inexplicably been “her turn,” even when Biden had been there waiting for his turn for the better party of forty-four years. It had been his turn. 2020 wasn’t his time—it was his last chance.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of anybody that talking to would cause him to feel any better.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Of course Trump had called to gloat, he shouldn’t have expected anything else. At the very least, it filled him with some odd sense of pride that it was he and not Kamala that Trump had first called. The phone rang again. Biden begrudgingly got to his feet and walked over to the Resolute Desk, supposing that he should probably answer it. He sat down and held the receiver to his ear.</p><p>It wasn’t Trump. “Hey, uhhh… Joe.”</p><p>Dammit. Biden wouldn’t have answered had he known it was him. “Mr. President,” he said curtly.</p><p>“I just wanted to call to, uhhh… check in with you, make sure you’re doing alright.”</p><p>“I am. Why are you actually calling me?”</p><p>Obama sighed. “Don’t be like this, Joe. I know you haven’t been doing the greatest since…”</p><p>“Since what?”</p><p>“Since you, uhhh… stepped down back in July.” The end of his sentence was abrupt, as if he had cut himself off midthought.</p><p>Biden didn’t answer. He could hardly believe the nerve this man had.</p><p>“Joe, it was for the party.”</p><p>That was it for him. “And in case you didn’t notice, Barry, we fucking lost! She didn’t win! She blew a race that you know full well that I would’ve won, just like Hillary did back in 2016!”</p><p>“Joe, let me—”</p><p>“Trump, MAGA, all this bullshit, it’s you! It’s all your fault!”</p><p>“Joe, your polling was, well, I don’t want to uhhh… sugarcoat this. Your numbers were atrocious. You were gonna lose Minnesota and Virginia. Uhhh… let me clear—Kamala didn’t win, but she certainly minimized the damage.”</p><p>“I would have beaten Trump in 2016.”</p><p>Obama paused for a moment. “You know, I’d like us to put our differences aside here and uhhh… come—”</p><p>“I’m not a fucking debate moderator, Barry, just speak your goddamn mind and stop trying to skirt around this shit!”</p><p>“Alright. I made the wrong call.”</p><p>Biden couldn’t stop himself from laughing. “That’s it? After nearly ten years that’s all you can come up with? Give me a break!”</p><p>“I—Joe, you said it yourself, it’s been almost ten years. You’re staring eastwards at an empty spot in the sky when the sun is setting behind you.”</p><p>“Really putting that Harvard education to good use, aren’t you?

Bush is too close to call… no results tonight… historically close… recounts have begun… unlikely to be settled on the state-level…  ”</p><p>No, that wasn’t right.</p><p>“The presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has been deadlocked, with each candidate receiving 269 electoral votes. As such, the election will go to Congress, with the House electing the president and the Senate the vice president.”</p><p>Biden sighed and fell onto a couch. The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. A tie. Hardly satisfying. At the very least, Biden thought, the whole situation could further motivate the states to abolish the electoral college. Surely they would be unhappy with Congress electing the president, right?</p><p>Biden wondered how Congress was looking—he admittedly hadn’t been paying as much attention as he probably should have to the congressional elections. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and checked. Neither chamber had been fully called yet, but it looked as if the Democrats would narrowly end up taking control of the House. The state delegations, however, still seemed to be in control of the Republicans. So Trump would end up as president.</p><p>On the Senate side of things, Tester had lost as expected, but Brown and Casey both held narrow leads. Additionally, Dan Osborn was essentially tied in Nebraska—if all three of them won and Osborn worked with the Democrats, it’d be 50–50. Enough for Kamala to break the tie and elect Walz as vice president. Biden decided to make it his mission to pull all the strings needed to get Walz elected. That’d be an actual accomplishment, a legacy to be proud of; crippling Trump’s second term with a hostile Congress and vice president.</p><p>He hadn’t given much thought to this scenario before, but come to think of it, it was probably the best possible outcome for him. Trump and Kamala had both lost, and it was he that would step in and fix things. He’d be the competent one, the adult in the room. Trump’s entire presidency would be seen as illegitimate, and Kamala would be remembered for fumbling an election that she should’ve won. That he could’ve won, had Barack and Pelosi not messed things up.</p><p>He had another thought. Had Barack not thrown his support behind Hillary, he probably would have beaten Trump in 2016. After that, he obviously would have won reelection in 2020 given how all of the Democrats’ best issues were in the spotlight, and then he’d be right back where he was, only this time after having served two full terms and becoming a real, prominent part of the party lineage.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of many people he cared enough about to answer.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Was Trump calling to gloat? Biden thought it was a bit embarrassing to brag about winning a contingent election, but regardless, it filled with some odd sense of pride that it was he and not Kamala that Trump had first called. The phone rang again. Biden begrudgingly got to his feet and walked over to the Resolute Desk, supposing that he should probably answer it. He sat down and held the receiver to his ear.</p><p>It wasn’t Trump. “Hey, uhhh… Joe.”</p><p>Dammit. Biden wouldn’t have answered had he known it was him. “Mr. President,” he said curtly.</p><p>“I just wanted to call to, uhhh… ask you how you’re feeling with all of this stuff.”</p><p>“I mean, what am I supposed to feel? It’s just math—Trump will become president and Walz will probably become VP. I should be asking how you’re feeling. I doubt this was part of your master plan.”</p><p>Obama sighed. “Don’t be like this, Joe. I know you haven’t been doing the greatest since…”</p><p>“Since what?”</p><p>“Since you, uhhh… stepped down back in July.” The end of his sentence was abrupt, as if he had cut himself off midthought.</p><p>Biden didn’t answer. He could hardly believe the nerve this man had.</p><p>“Joe, it was for the party.”</p><p>“Well, congrats on landing the party in the second-worst position it could’ve found itself in. Impressive stuff. Almost as impressive as what you did back in 2016. You have a real talent for this kind of stuff, Barry.”</p><p>“That’s not—”</p><p>“You know, when you think about it, you actually managed to get Trump and MAGA elected. You started an entire movement, that’s nothing to scoff at.”</p><p>“I did not, uhhh… get Trump elected. Hillary was the one that lost—”</p><p>“And who was the one that got Hillary the nomination over more viable candidates?”</p><p>“Alright, fine. I, uhhh… supported Hillary, I thought she could win. I was mistaken.”</p><p>“And you were mistaken about Kamala as well, and I was right. And guess what, Jack, nobody’s gonna blame for all this shit the same way they would’ve if she fully lost. All the blame’s gonna fall on her for not being able to win a few thousand more votes, as well as everyone who got her here for letting this all happen.”</p><p>Obama chuckled. “You know what, Joe? You’re right. This isn’t your fault and history’s gonna look back on you, uhhh… pretty fondly. Which, at least to me, makes it even stranger that you’re spending all of your time thinking about an election from eight years ago.”</p><p>“I think it’d be a lot nicer if folks could look fondly at me now, rather than in twenty years, when I’ll have… well, you know.”</p><p>“I—Joe, you said it yourself, you’re not going to live forever. You’re staring eastwards at an empty spot in the sky when the sun is setting behind you.”</p><p>“Really putting that Harvard education to good use, aren’t you? What a vivid metaphor. ‘when the sun is setting—’ the hell does that even mean?”</p><p>“When was the last time you weren’t thinking about the next election? The 60s? When I was in third grade? You’re nearing nightfall, Joe, and I’d hate for you to spend what little time you have left consumed by what could’ve been.”</p><p>Biden slammed the telephone down, cutting off whatever smartass malarkey Obama was to spout out next. He swiped it away, attempting to knock it off the desk, but it merely moved an inch or so. Biden closed his eyes and leaned back, feeling bitter, angry, and confused.</p>"

The fall hurt him more than he would like to admit. Even though they had won, it still felt like a defeat. After all, he knew full well that the pundits were likely already telling their audiences that the only reason the Democratic ticket had won was because he wasn’t on it. Is that how he’d be remembered? The man that Kamala had triumphed in spite of, not because of? What a legacy. After everything, he would go down in the history books as a placeholder, and not a particularly effective one at that.</p><p>He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. Maybe he could pardon Hunter. He thought that Kamala probably wouldn’t appreciate that, but what other choice did he have? Let Hunter go to prison over a bunch of trumped-up charges? He shook his head. He was still the president, the most powerful person on the planet, he didn’t need to concern himself with the whining of others—he was still in this.</p><p>He wondered what would happen to Trump. He doubted Kamala would keep Merrick Garland around, so there was a good chance that his federal cases would finally catch up to him, maybe even send him to prison. That’d be the end of him, unless—surely he wouldn’t run again in 2028, right? And if he did—no, of course he would lose. Of course.</p><p>All in all, he knew this was probably the best outcome for him. Probably. Part of him still wondered if he would’ve won had Barack and Pelosi not stolen the nomination from him at gunpoint. Although he knew that they would never admit it, he was pretty sure that he would’ve. He had a stronger appeal amongst blue-collar workers, moderates, Southerners, and even progressives—Bernie and AOC had been his strongest supporters in the days following that debate. Yes, surely he would have won, and probably by more.</p><p>But he wouldn’t have just defeated him this time around. He would’ve defeated him back in 2016, had Barack not held him back and let their worst candidate receive the nomination on a silver platter. Somehow, it had inexplicably been “her turn,” even when Biden had been there waiting for his turn for the better part of forty-four years. It had been his turn. 2020 wasn’t his time—it was his last chance.</p><p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Once. Twice. Three times. Biden ignored it; he couldn’t think of anybody that talking to would cause him to feel any better.</p><p>A staffer poked his head into the room. “The former president, sir.”</p><p>Was Trump calling to concede?

Fucking never! Because this entire goddamn party revolves around folks like you and Hillary that have a stroke of luck and then smile their way into the history books!”</p><p>“Uhhh… let me clear, Joe. I saved you from political obscurity when I picked you in 2008. So if we’re talking luck—”</p><p>“Why didn’t you pick me in 2016, then?”</p><p>Obama laughed. “2016? Is this what this is all about? 2016? Joe, you became president, you won—who cares if it was four years later?”</p><p>“I sure as hell care. MAGA would have died with Trump and I would’ve had a Congress I could’ve actually worked with, for one. I could’ve passed historic legislation, I could have been the modern day LBJ—”</p><p>Obama was still laughing. “Weren’t you ranked as the 14th best president by historians? Joe, listen to me—you’ve been a good president, you’ve passed historic legislation. Just because they aren’t carving your face on Mount Rushmore doesn’t mean you were a failure!”</p><p>“Folks sure seem to think—”</p><p>“History will vindicate you. It always does with these kinds of things.”</p><p>“Well, Barry, in case you couldn’t tell from my career-ending debate performance, I’m going to be long gone by the time history vindicates me.

Kamala had won by so much… Surely, even if the party was right about his popularity, he would’ve won had he been on the ticket, right? To most people—or at least most Democrats—this was a mandate, a landslide unseen since the Obama days. But to him, it was proof that that begrudging decision he made in July was the wrong one. He had lost out on the opportunity to serve another term, and for what? To be viewed as a placeholder? Was that all?</p><p>He took a deep breath. He supposed he still had a couple of months to tie up loose ends. Maybe he could pardon Hunter. He thought that Kamala probably wouldn’t appreciate that, but what other choice did he have?
