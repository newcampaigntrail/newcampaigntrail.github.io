The quicker the nomination could be decided, the better.</p><br><br><p>The worst part? You don't even get the credit for putting an end to the Bush family's political career - that honor goes to your upcoming opponent - Donald Trump. A man who spent the entire primary doing practically everything Republicans have believed for so long not to do - go full extremist on immigration and race, but pledge less trade and to protect social security. How the hell did this world get so topsy-turvy? One of your advisors tell you that it's time to get up and go.<p><p>You quickly get up from your chair, look at Bill, and begin to walk into the venue.
