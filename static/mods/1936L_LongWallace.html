You smile as the reality of the situation washes over you; finally your dream has come true, You’ve wanted this since you were a humble lawyer, and now, you, Huey Long, will be President!<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>Hopefully, you can achieve your goals, after all, there’s a lot to do, but the Progressives have gained majorities in both the House and Senate so you shouldn’t have to much trouble. You’ll be able to implement your ambitious economic program and hopefully end the Depression. Keep Wallace happy and be wary of Coughlan, the Japanese and the situation in Europe, and you should be fine.</p><p>But just remember, the American people are a fickle bunch; while in 4 years you could be sailing to re-election, it’s just as likely you could be facing Impeachment, the barrel of a gun or, well… let’s just say if the rumors circling among the east coast elite are to be believed… Charles Lindbergh. But for now, savour your historic victory.</i><br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;"
