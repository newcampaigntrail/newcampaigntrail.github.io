Robertson, Dole, Kemp, and other opponents seemed like they would be kick out the front-runner. Fortunately, due to a rigourous campaign and some dirt-flinging the Vice President would certainly be the party's candidate.</p><p>The polls showed a lopsided victory for Hart and the Democrats at large, and who wouldn't have suspected it? An administration mired in scandal, the economy still being in a slump, and rising crime rates. It certainly was a time for change, a change of heart from the status quo for new ideas which Hart represented.</p><p>Vice President-turned President Bush wasn't going to let this stop him however. Being propelled to President, he needed to make sure his own party and his legacy remained intact. Ensued the attack campaign that Bush and his Republican machine threw at Hart, not letting up for a second. It seemed to have worked, but only in making this not a totally embarrasing defeat. Despite that, the Republicans have been repudiated and perhaps a new generation of politics will ensue in Hart's victory.</p>"];
