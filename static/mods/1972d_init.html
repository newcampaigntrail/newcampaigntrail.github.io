America's nearing its final conclusion as an imperialist power - a veiled dictatorship with no real opposition, just the eternal controlled opposition of the party duopoly. Gus Hall, longtime leader of the Communist Party USA has had enough.<br><br>Hall used to be a staunch reformist, to the point that his party endorsed Johnson in 1964 to prevent Goldwater’s ascendancy. However, the coronation of John Connally at the Democratic National Convention has convinced Hall that an alliance with American liberals is impossible. At this point, the party's strategy has shifted to that of an open Presidential run once again - the way it was back before the depression. Hall will need to contend with both the chicanery the American state can throw at him as well as his own (numerous) character flaws if he wants a chance in hell of sparking the class consciousness he's dedicated his life to spreading.<br><button onclick='next3()'>INFO: Old-New Left Divide</button></p>",

Your victory speech was in front of an ecstatic crowd in South Dakota, and everyone could see the tears in your eyes. This is an astounding victory that political analysts will be studying for decades to come, and the climax of a chaotic past few years. This has completely shaken up the way the Democratic Party operates, and the next four years will be incredibly interesting to watch. Good luck with Vietnam, and here's to you.

The party stands at a crossroads. The Republicans were able to not only turn around their devastating loss in 1964, but in fact fully embraced Goldwater's brand of conservatism to reap two major wins in a row. The Democrats may be able to do the same in 1976 and even 1980, if you put in a good fight with this election. Or, they could nominate a more right-leaning centrist candidate, in hopes of placating moderates. In any event, you can always go back to the senate. Hopefully Nixon stays true to his promise of bringing peace with honor, and can leave the White House with dignity in four years.</p>",
