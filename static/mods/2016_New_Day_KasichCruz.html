What led to your victory? Well, you were hopeful and you were tolerant and frankly rather liberal. In the end, your rhetoric of light and hope won you this election. Divisive populism from both the left and the right failed to bring you down.
<br></br>
Thankfully, you\'ll come into office with a majority in both chambers of Congress, so you should have no trouble getting your optimistic and bipartisan agenda through. You’ll be able to do what you like with trade, with foreign policy, and with the economy. Maybe you\’ll be able to balance the budget, or at least cut down the deficit? It may not mesh ver Well, whatever happens, this victory will remain with you forever. You went from the expectation of destruction to this historic win.`;

You were expected to lose this election, and your odd strategy just reinforced that expectation. Rightly so, unfortunately.
<br></br>
What led to your loss? Well, you were hopeful and you were tolerant and frankly rather liberal. In the end, your rhetoric of light and hope lost you this election, along with a healthy dose of ideological skepticism. Divisive populism from both the left and the right brought you down.
<br></br>
Thankfully, the Republican Party still holds a majority in both chambers of Congress, so Sanders should have trouble getting his radical socialist agenda through. Even despite that, this is a historic win for the Progressive Democrats, who are finally able to get their champion into the White House. Sanders\' brand of Progressive politics is increasingly becoming normalized, as other Democratic Socialists sweep into office on his down ballot coattails. Hopefully your successor can block him from a second term. For now, it looks like retirement is in your future.`;

After Trump dropped out for you, your victory was expected. That doesn\'t make it any less sweet, however - especially given the magnitude!

What led to your victory? Well, by pivoting in a direction that Trump liked, by treating Sanders like he did, and by compromising your own vision to gain his support, you have managed to convince the Donald to end his war against your campaign, and by doing so brought his supporters back into the fold. Many are surprised that he was willing to back you at all, but you gave a lot for this. Your pivots hurt you, but Bernie was so radical that it didn\'t matter. But in the end, your rhetoric of light and hope didn\'t win you this election. Divisive rhetoric crafted to win over Trump and his supporters did.
<br></br>
Thankfully, you still have a majority in both chambers of Congress, so you should have no trouble getting your agenda through. Though given the bones you\'ve thrown to the Trump crowd, you may have to modify what you desire to suit their tastes. You’ll be able to do what you like with foreign policy, and move the economy in a slightly more populist direction. Maybe you\’ll also somehow be able to balance the budget, or at least cut down the deficit? Well, whatever happens, at least you won.
