Washington</h4><p>If you tried to count everybody who ever felt neutral about The Bull-Moose (1914) or its subject, President Theodore Roosevelt, you'd only need to use one hand. Regarded as a pioneering achievement in technical filmmaking and the first bona-fide blockbuster, this four-hour-long historical epic also set race relations back in the country decades and imprinted a fascistic, nationalistic version of America's rise on a generation of children and adults alike. Beloved in its day, the film has since become reviled, being taught in modern schools once more, not as historical fact, but as an examination of the consequence of misinformation and hagiography run amok.</p><p>All of this begs the question: What is actually <em>in</em> this film? What were the scenes that enraptured Americans for 30 years, propelling it to the undisputed number one box-office position for nearly thirty years? How did it help Americans make sense of things after the shock of Roosevelt's murder? These are the questions I intend to answer in this article. This is an analysis of The Bull-Moose (1914).</p><p>Our film opens in 1799. An aged George Washington, 67 years old, lies on his deathbed, Martha Washington at his side. The first independent president, the father of the country, has lived long enough to see his beloved America overcome by partisan infighting, Federalists and Republicans tearing the country apart as they battle for the future of America's economy. As a tear rolls down Washington's eye, he turns to Martha, and an intertitle tells us what he is whispering: "Soon, another Hero will take up the Mantle and save our Republic."</p><p>We are next taken to the streets of Manhattan, 1858. Mrs. Martha Stewart Bulloch, framed in the same lighting and angle as Martha Washington, is in the middle of a difficult labor as the night yields to the morning, rain spattering the windows. Suddenly, the rain subsides. The clouds part, and the sun shines directly on their townhouse. A sense of peace comes over Martha, and a beautiful baby boy is produced from under her gown.</p><p>As a young Theodore Roosevelt grows up, we watch him outperform his classmates effortlessly, passing every test and winning every sporting match. He reads in the newspaper about corruption and chaos in the Reconstructed South, feeling sympathy for them unusual for a northerner raised during the Civil War.</p><p>The film skips to after his graduation at Harvard, showing him leading the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill. He is hit by a Spanish bullet and knocked off his horse, and all his men think he has been struck down. However, as the sun shines behind him, Roosevelt rises from the ground, revealing that the bullet bounced off the buckle of his backpack belt. The message is clear: Providence has preserved Roosevelt yet again.</p><p>Next, the movie shows us Roosevelt rising through the ranks in New York politics. He fights corruption as a reformist Republican, standing up to the party establishment, who are only interested in lining the pockets of themselves, their moneyed backers explicitly portrayed as Jewish, and their black voter base, all at the expense of the white man. Attempting to rid themselves of the troublesome Roosevelt, they elevate him to the Vice Presidency, a functionally useless position at this point in history.</p><p>However, after President McKinley is felled by what the film describes as a "negro assassin," Roosevelt ascends to the presidency. He takes his fight to the national level, passing Progressive Era pro-worker laws designed to benefit the "common white man" while battling the insidious Republican establishment, standing up for white southerners, attempting to orient the Republican Party towards them.</p><p>Running for President in 1912, Roosevelt is shot, once again by a "negro assassin" in the crowd. As he falls to the ground, the accompanying band plays an angelic choir as he utters his last words to his supporters: "You must carry on my fight, my friends." He then passes away peacefully. The framing is, once again, explicitly Christ-like, and his funeral is lavish. The movie ends.</p><p>On a technical level, it's easy to see why audiences loved this movie. The battle scenes look decades ahead of their time, and the score played by the accompanying band is reminiscent of cannon thunder and gunfire. The camerawork is creative and innovative, using novel angles audiences had never seen before. Most of all, the film excels in portraying Roosevelt in a messianic light, something that must have been deeply emotional after losing him not two years prior. Even one hundred years later, you can almost find yourself believing that Roosevelt is the Messiah, sent to save the country in the mold of Washington before him.</p><p>Of course, you cannot discuss this movie without examining the racial aspect. Black Americans are portrayed at once as sneaky and shifty controllers, and as violent lackeys dependent on corrupt politicians for wealth. Jews are portrayed as puppet-masters, manipulating the Republican politicians and black Americans alike for their own shady benefit. Indeed, the movie contributed to the re-establishment of the Ku Klux Klan, which revered Roosevelt with banners and signs at every rally. It is difficult to overstate the degree to which this movie's portrayal of Black Americans and Jewish Americans damaged race relations in this country, being directly blamed for the 1914 Norfolk riot.</p><p>Nonetheless, watching it does have value, but not in the way its creators intended. It shows us what our past was like, and forces us to reckon with the demons that reside in our own history. It challenges us to think about the American promise, how it was framed and seen by those who wrote it, and the dangers of national mythmaking. For that reason, I think more people should watch The Bull-Moose.</p>`)

But that isn’t necessarily true.</p><p>In 1916, the unlikely duo of President Theodore Roosevelt and Vice President Robert La Follette had a rocky relationship. Roosevelt remained quiet on whether he would seek a fourth term, having grown to somewhat regret his behavior against Taft. La Follette saw an opportunity, ran in the primaries against him, and forced yet another deadlocked Republican National Convention, which ended up nominating his ally Francis McGovern for President. Though historians have come to see La Follette’s decision as selfish, it did precedent for future Vice Presidents to run as need be.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s hard to state that such a bid by the Vice President spells doom for the Democratic Party’s chances in 2004. When Vice President William Scranton mounted a primary bid against President Richard Nixon in 1968, Republican operatives, and the public, believed that the party was doomed to defeat against the Pasty Mink/Robert Byrd ticket. But after fending off Scranton at the convention, Nixon scraped by with victories in Illinois and California. Of course, Nixon would later be forced to resign in favor of Vice President Clifford Case, following revelations of the Watergate scandal, something which many Democrats still feel cost them that race.</p><p>Finally, polling has shown President Vilsack with a large lead in the primaries - nationally, he's at 42%, compared to 27% for Gephardt. Of course, Vilsack is under 50%, but pundits consider him the favorite to win renomination.</p>`)

Reports from the region say that Budapest and much of the outskirts of the city are now under the anarchist fever. This is the third instance of such a movement gaining traction, following a recent uprising in Bavaria, and far more successful movements in Austria and the Ukraine.</p><p>Anarchism, a mass movement which stands against centralized authority and promotes self-managed, stateless societies, has seen an expanded range of power within Europe following the collapse of the old monarchies - from Russia, to Austria-Hungary, and the German Empire. In addition, anarchists were also responsible for multiple assassinations in the past, including US President William McKinley.</p><p>The success in Austria, a movement which proclaimed its roots to when President Roosevelt toured the country in 1910, has especially given anarchists in Europe hope and the nations of the continent fear. One idea is that large victories for anarchists in central Europe may allow the movement to spread further into the newly established republics in the eastern Europe.</p>`)

The answer to this lies in a very fascinating history lesson.</p><p>Within a few years after the breakup, the animosity from the end of the band had begun to cool down, but no formal plans for reunion were ever considered. It wasn't until 1980, when John Lennon narrowly survived an assassination attempt, and landed himself in the hospital, that he was given time to muse and think. The extended stay in the hospital meant that for a couple weeks, and during this time, one of his friends visiting the hospital had brought up the history parallel. Like Lennon, Roosevelt had a falling out with a former ally, President Taft, and was shot but later lived to reconcile with his old foe - to the point where Roosevelt even discussed helping Taft win the Republican nomination in 1920.</p><p>According to reports, upon returning from the hospital, Lennon later bemused that, if these two men could reunite, what was stopping him and Paul from recording some more songs? Lennon told Paul this story, expressed his desire to arrange a recording session between the two, and the two of them recorded and released "The Man in the Arena". A track on Lennon's <i>Milk and Honey</i> album, "The Man in the Arena" tells both the story of both Taft and Roosevelt, and Paul and Lennon themselves. The release, a surprise appearance which was unannounced in the lead-up to the album's release, broke sales records and sealed the deal for a formal Beatles reunion.</p><p>Now, the reunited band is back on their own terms, and they have said they'll be working on future albums "whenever they feel like it".</p>`)

These documents claim that, in all-but-official terms, that Clark demanded that Britain allow American annexation of Canada as a price for entry into the war. Clark had essentially argued in these documents that Americans could not justify joining the conflict unless there was an explicit gain in territory or influence, and that without such a large price, Clark could not secure passage of a declaration of war in Congress. Clark's comments came at a time of strained American-British and American-Canadian relations.</p><p>Of course, Britain bluntly refused these claims, pointing to how unpopular the idea of annexation was within Canada.
