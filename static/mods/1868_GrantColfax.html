He stood firm when Seymour called him a tool of black interests. Against all these, Wade stood firm, and the nation, with justice and equanimity in its heart, stood with him.</p><p>Now, President Wade and Vice President Fenton seize the White House, where they shall rebuild the South and bring that noble dream of equality to all American men. It is as if we live in a beautiful dream, where the vision that <q>All Men are Created Equal</q> has finally come true.

Much blood was spilled as the Klan was swiftly hunted down. However, the North was far less kind to the Senator. Business and White Supremacists formed an axis against the President, frightened by his radicalism on race and on monetary issues.</p><p>Such a nexus of capital and racialized anger could not be beaten by the President, as Governor Seymour assailed Wade’s expansion of federal power at every turn. In truth, perhaps the President was too much, too fast. He ultimately faltered in the wake of Seymour’s assault, and the rebel party once again controls the White House.

Blair has already proclaimed this to be the white man’s victory. If this is what victory is for your race, perhaps you are no white man.

That satyr of rebellion has held you to a draw, turning your Vicksburg into a Wilderness Campaign, and the Congress now assembles to elect you President. With your party’s vast majority in the House and Senate, it is but a formality, yet still it is highly disturbing to see that the American people saw Seymour’s campaign of lawlessness and violence and were inspired to go for him. Perhaps Thaddeus’ fears of our future were not unfounded…</p><p>For now though, we must fight for a majority in 72. The Democracy has gained in the Congress, much to your chagrin, but you still have ample room to pass your agenda, rebuild the South, and move the country past this dark chapter in its history. Already Congress is preparing a 15th Amendment granting suffrage to the Freedmen, North and South. Their votes shall doubtlessly be critical. Your heart still, sinks at this near defeat. You can only pray that the American people’s hearts shall be stronger in the coming days, so that you may bring peace and honor onto our nation. Godspeed General. Make this nation run again.</p>"

  return "<h3><q>Laws Are To Govern All Alike</q></h3><p>It was close, closer than you hoped. Despite your vast margin in the Electoral College, Seymour’s wicked army clawed faster and faster towards you, putting up a stronger defense than anyone thought possible. A party in disarray at Tammany Hall had, ballooned by racial resentment and force of arms in the South, nearly caught up to you, seizing the White House for treacherous ends. Such a strong performance by Horatio has inspired the Congress to act quickly, moving fast to pass a new amendment guaranteeing the vote for freedmen, to ensure their numbers can aid us in every state.</p><p>Still, this is a victory larger than perhaps any of yours since Appomattox. You enter the Congress with strong majorities, prepared to pass your agenda and return the nation to peacetime after a decade of grueling violence. With your election, the nation has proved that there are enough good, god-fearing men ready to put down their swords and, for once, let us have peace. Godspeed General Grant. You are the Commander-In-Chief in a turbulent time, and the fate of millions is in your hands. You must succeed, or the consequences for the nation will be dire."

  return "<h3><q>And So, We Have Peace</q></h3><p>In a major strategic victory, you have utterly routed Seymour and his band of rebels, sending them scattering back to the hills, terrified by your power. The weight of their past misdeeds could not be lifted, and Seymour retires to Utica, a whelp mewling in the might of the new Republican majority. Already your party is preparing to regain rule, with you as its joyous protector, the man who saved the Union twice. Parades march for you as you prepare for what shall certainly be an eventful term.</p><p>Your administration shall be turbulent. The  Democrats still stole several southern states at gunpoint, and the work of Reconstruction must end these dens of sin and terror and restore the South to honest rule. But if anyone can do it, General Grant, it is you. Though you have faltered many times, you are by far the best man to lead us into the 1870s. With your unyielding trust in your fellow man, and your commitment to rebuilding the South, it is true that you shall make yourself the greatest of Presidents, the man with whom the dreams of the Freedmen are restored, and the man who rebuilds America after the bloodiest war in its history.</p>"
