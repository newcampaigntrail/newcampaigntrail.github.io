We have endured much. We have lost much. And yet, here we stand.</p><p>In the stillness of this hour, let us pause to remember the cost. Across this land, from the icy shores of Maine to the fertile valleys of California, fields lie fallow where crops once grew, factories sit silent where engines once roared, and countless homes echo only with the absence of voices we shall never hear again. The burden of our grief is vast, but we must carry it together.</p><p>Let us not dwell, however, on sorrow alone. Out of the ashes of division, we now face the daunting but noble task of building a new America—an America born not of fear but of hope, not of division but of unity.</p><p>We are no longer bound by the chains of the past. For too long, we allowed ourselves to be fractured by prejudice, by greed, by the false promises of those who sought to turn neighbor against neighbor for their own gain. That time is over. From this day forward, we are one people—not because we were forced to be, but because we have chosen to be.</p><p>The road ahead is steep. The wounds of this conflict will not heal overnight, nor should we expect them to. Justice demands that we address the pain inflicted, the wrongs committed, the truths obscured. But justice also demands mercy. Let us not be a nation that repays violence with vengeance or hatred with spite. Let us instead be a nation that rebuilds not only its cities and fields but its very spirit.</p><p>There will be those who say it cannot be done—that the divisions are too deep, that the dreams we share are too lofty. To them, I say this: we have already achieved the impossible. We have survived. Now, together, we must thrive.</p><p>Tonight, as you sit in your homes, with your families, with your memories of those we have lost, I ask you to believe—not in me, not in the government, but in each other. Believe in the neighbor who opens their door to lend a hand. Believe in the teacher who shapes the future with quiet patience. Believe in the worker who builds the foundation upon which we all stand. Believe, most of all, that the light we have rediscovered in our darkest hour will guide us forward.</p><p>And so, as the embers of this long struggle fade, let us vow never to let their memory be extinguished. From them, we draw warmth, courage, and resolve. From them, we ignite a new dawn.</p><p>Thank you, my friends, my fellow Americans. Let us begin again, together.</p><p><b>- President Daniel Hoan, 1943.</b></p>`)

The murmurs in 1940 are more serious, and you see mild success on the early ballots but the convention passes over you. Though disappointed, you campaign for the Thomas Dewey ticket in '40.</p><p>Mr. Baker will pass away in 1937, on Christmas. Thus, Bainbridge Colby, a man who had never held elected office at the time, succeeds him. He is able to win in 1940 and 1944, becoming the longest serving President - largely on circumstances.
