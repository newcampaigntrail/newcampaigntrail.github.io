He didn’t even win the nation's capital, Washington DC. Something didn’t feel right. SpongeBob rubbed his eyes trying to figure out if he was dreaming or not, but alas he wasn’t. Suddenly, the ghost of Barry Goldwater appeared in SpongeBob’s bedroom, much to the surprise of the Sponge himself. SpongeBob couldn’t believe his eyes. “Why is Goldwater here?” “What does he want from me?” Those are the thoughts that raced SpongeBob’s mind. SpongeBob spoke to the ghost of Goldwater. “Goldwater is that you…?” SpongeBob asked curiously. “Why yes, I am Barry Goldwater.” Goldwater responded. “W-why are you here? What do you want from m-me?” SpongeBob inquired. Goldwater chuckled, “Don’t worry, I’ll show you…” Goldwater disappears from SpongeBob’s room and SpongeBob is left alone…<br><br>And then suddenly, SpongeBob is transported into an unknown area with Goldwater. It appears to be a control room. SpongeBob is confused and he turns to Goldwater, “What are we doing, Goldwater?” SpongeBob curiously asks the Senator. “Just watch. Do you remember that one TCT scenario that has me running against Kennedy in a timeline where he wasn’t assassinated?” Goldwater asks SpongeBob. SpongeBob is confused, he doesn’t know what Goldwater is talking about. “What is TCT? I don’t understand, Goldwater…” SpongeBob stammers. Goldwater rolls his eyes. “It doesn’t matter. All that matters is…” Goldwater pauses, while slowly typing in the nuclear launch code, and he says… “I am in favor of nuking the White House, the Capitol building, and all the impoverished parts of the nation.” He finally enters in the launch code and subsequently nukes all across the United States go off. SpongeBob remained speechless. Perhaps advocating for nukes wasn’t the best idea after all…";
