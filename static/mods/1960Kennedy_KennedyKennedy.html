You don’t envy him - Dick Russell is a good ally to have, but he’s getting gray and liberals like Humphrey are the future of the party. The party has had a full schism, and he’s going to need to use as much influence as he can if he’s going to get a middle ground on civil rights and focus on the important stuff.</p><p>As a rather tipsy Lyndon, clutching Lady Bird, gives a victory speech and you consider your own future.

There’s some chatter, as the politically ambitious young issue half hearted assurances to the old rich men that had backed the campaign - yourself included. Not many are entirely sure what actually happens here. There’s a contingent election, everyone remembers that from civics. And there are a lot of Democrats in the House, so Lyndon probably wins?</p><p>The man himself strides out onto stage. He’s smiling, but he isn’t happy. If he bared his teeth any harder, they’d shatter like it was one of those cartoons.  But up on stage, he’s promising to keep fighting and turn the page on from Eisenhower, all that good stuff.</p><p>In all likelihood, Nixon knows he can’t win the contingent election. Maybe he’ll work out some deal to release an elector and put Lyndon over the line - make Nixon secretary of state, or something. They’ll create some kind of sick Frankenstein's monster cabinet to avoid the real headache of a contingent, but there’s a real possibility Nixon fights like an animal to try and get ahead.</p><p>The limited good news is that this outcome throws prior wheeling and dealing out the window. This is basically unprecedented. There’s going to be understanding if a few cabinet posts or policy considerations are changed. Despite the stigma, it could actually put Lyndon in a stronger position for 1961 and accomplish whatever agenda he wants to set out. And he’ll count on one John Connally to help him do it.</p>`;
