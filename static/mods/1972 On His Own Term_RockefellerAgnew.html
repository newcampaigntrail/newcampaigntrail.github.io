The size of his mandate gave the president confidence and complete trust in his secretary of state. When the North Vietnamese broke the armistice agreement, the bombing began once again. Rockefeller championed a new international organization. The New Left tried to oppose him, but he was never one to back down from a challenge. Over time, it became clear that the only winners were those who submitted to Rockefeller. He would live to see his nephew Jay take his old office in 1988.

You couldn't help but lay dormant in agony for years after the house voted in favor of Muskie by a slim majority. What caused your defeat? Well, besides the obvious, like the Cambodia leaks. It was the conservative protest of some 30 representatives that betrayed the party and voted for Bill Rusher. It's starting to make sense. Rusher never planned to start a new party his goal was to get you out of the way and open the field for Reagan. Now you feel you're entitled to at least try to get back at them. Early polls predict you will lose to Reagan by 10 points plus. There's no denying he's the front-runner for the nomination, and it will be an uphill battle.

Happy holds your hand as you lament about the death of the “Grand Old Party.” The campaign was contentious, and it seemed that Muskie was making a comeback in the last few weeks, but time wasn't on the president's side. He lost the election 257 to Reagan's 281 electoral votes. It may not be a massive mandate, but it is one President Reagan will run with.

The power to install more “Rockefeller men” in those same positions in 2 years.</p> \n<p>While there are going to be bumps in the road of your second term like your corrupt Vice president. You'll plead your innocence and tell the media you had no idea about his bribery scandal. You most definitely knew you knew he was no good even in 68, but the press won't find that out. Who will you nominate as his replacement? Romney? Percy? Not that it matters. More and more of the Republican party will submit to you. Nixon is a sign of the times. Who knows what lies above your next term? Maybe Nixon will give it another try in 4 years, or maybe Percy or even Brooke? Regardless, your victory has finally vindicated Rockefeller Republicanism. Goldwater denounces you at every turn. He's a man unable to be persuaded nor bought. South Vietnam will be contentious when it falls. That is if you allow it to fall. Who knows, Nelson, you've got four more years to pave the way.</p>",

Muskie is surprised that the lead he gained was cut short. Now you have more chaos as the election is thrown to the house. Muskie has the upper hand, but he will have to compromise with his right wing. You're probably thinking you can steal the votes he needs in the South, aren't you? Let's see how it goes.</p>\n<p>[January 1975] You smile toward the crowd of reporters who came to hear your announcement. The announcement that you are running for the 1976 Republican nomination. You couldn't help but lay dormant in agony for years after the house voted in favor of Muskie by a slim majority. What caused your defeat? Well, besides the obvious, like the Cambodia leaks. It was the conservative protest of some 30 representatives that betrayed the party and voted for Bill Rusher. It's starting to make sense. Rusher never planned to start a new party his goal was to get you out of the way and open the field for Reagan. Now you feel you're entitled to at least try to get back at them. Early polls predict you will lose to Reagan by 10 points plus. There's no denying he's the front-runner for the nomination, and it will be an uphill battle. Rockefeller Republicans aren't dead, but as of now, You're their life support, Nelson. </p>",

Happy holds your hand as you lament about the death of the “Grand Old Party.” The campaign was contentious, and it seemed that Muskie was making a comeback in the last few weeks, but time wasn't on the president's side. He lost the election 257 to Reagan's 281 electoral votes. It may not be a massive mandate, but it is one President Reagan will run with.
