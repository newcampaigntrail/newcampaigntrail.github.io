A vice president, the icon of the Democratic party, a two-time nominee - and yet you lost every single state against Nixon. Maybe it was the various scandals that bogged you down. Maybe it was Dobrynin, or Jack Chestnut. Or maybe Nixon was just too strong of an incumbent, too popular a president, for anyone to beat.</p><p>Your inglorious end to a campaign chock full of scandal and corruption has shocked the entire world - no one has lost this bad since, well, ever. Even the sacrificial lambs given up to Franklin Roosevelt did better than you.</p><p>Nevertheless, people seem not to blame you too much for it, although you will never again be allowed to run a national campaign. You are still personally liked in Minnesota, but your Senate colleagues will never look at you the same again, having received such a beating.</p><p>For now, you will return to the Senate, where you will need to rebuild your relationships with all of your disappointed Democratic colleagues. McGovern is chomping at the bit to run again, and he'll be the likely nominee in 1976. Nixon, on the other hand, is seeing shake-ups in his presidency - the Watergate scandal is getting to him, and it won't be long before he's kicked out of the White House for good. You can at least take solace in that.</p>",

You weren't even sure if you'd run in the first place, but you've somehow pulled it off. Perhaps it was Nixon's scandals that drew him down below you, or your own personal likeability. Maybe it was just the overwhelming will of the people, fed up with Nixon and Agnew's dirty tricks. Democrats across the nation are rejoicing at your victory, congratulating each other at showing Nixon what for. Nixon calls, audibly frustrated, but thanks you for <q>racking up such a victory</q> and being a <q>statesmanlike man</q> in the campaign. Soon after comes the call from President Johnson, who's absolutely gobsmacked.</p><p>Nevertheless, it's still a few months before you can go back to the White House. Your presidency will be an interesting one - will you stick to your campaign rhetoric, or move to the left or right? With majorities in both houses of Congress, you have ample pickings.</p><p>Congratulations, Mr. Humphrey.</p>",
