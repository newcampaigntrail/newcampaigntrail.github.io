I simply don't believe it.” “Look Harry, we have to do something about this.” The two most powerful men in the Senate had lunch with each other to discuss what was supposed to be setting motions in place that would allow for the Presidential inauguration of one Patrick Star. Although Mitch McConnell won reelection despite the Patrick landslide, he felt as if it was his duty to the country he grew up in to potentially sabotage the transfer of power to Patrick, just as when he marched with MLK all those years back. Should Patrick take control of the Bureaucracy, nuclear codes, and the economic recovery set in place, he would devastate the country for years to come. He also feared another major party. The Democrats were enough of a headache to deal with, but the Reform Party?!?! Absolutely not!<br><br>Thankfully, the man who he had recently clashed with over these past couple of years also saw Mitch's concerns. Harry Reid had a background in boxing, and even with Bush at the helm, he knew Bush was the Mike Tyson to Patrick's Glass Joe. On one hand, Reid also believed Patrick was a threat to national security, and surely falsifying evidence of fraud would be easy and believable, right?<br><br>But on the other, they would be able to harass the unholy shit out of the gullible sea star. They could prove why the two party system was here to stay and unwilling to accept any newcomers. But as they began weighing their options, two gunshots were heard in the distance, with blood soon rushing down from both men's abdomens. As the perpetrator revealed themself, you could see the shocked reactions of the two drained faces. It was none other than Patrick Star, as he began explaining what he was doing here.<br><br>”Hahahaha yes! I've finally got you two where I wanted you to be. Although it took mass amounts of fraud, I finally achieved the Presidency after a decade or so of faking my stupidity to the masses, and I'm not about to let you old hags ruin it for me. I've worked too hard and too long. But I can do this for you, yeah. I'll give you two the Old Yellow Treatment!”<br><br><i>The bodies of McConnell and Reid were never discovered, and we may never know why Patrick went through all this effort for no apparent reason.</i><br><br>"

Even though statistical procedures had supposedly proven this couldn't occur, Patrick's approval ratings were sitting in the negatives. And when I mean negatives, I don't mean there was a higher percentage of folks that disapproved of their king than approved(although that was also the case). No, I literally mean his approval was represented by a negative integer. -5%, to be exact.<br><br>Patrick had established himself as Patrick the First, head of the newly established American Monarchy, in 2010 after unanimously winning in the electoral college two years prior, albeit in shady ways. With his opposition out of the way after falsifying claims of treason against them, Patrick stood as the one and only ruler of the American populace. Nobody could attempt to place any checks on them, or else they would suffer the consequences in rather barbaric and cruel ways. Let's just say Kim Jong Un would be horrified to find out what Patrick was cooking, it was that bad.<br><br>After the realization set in that he was too unpopular for mathematics to handle, Patrick's expression turned from one of jovial tribulation to one of anger and derision. Was he in a terrible situation before, yes. He even placed a sword which held a single line of thread above his throne to express his constant paranoia about losing power. Apparently he received the idea from some random classical myth. But regardless, he sat up without saying a single word and went to his sand-encrusted mirror to find something.<br><br>As he went to gaze at this specific mirror, he only saw a reflection of himself, at least at first. But as minutes flew by, the image reflected had transformed into what seemingly looked like a hideous caricature of himself, and it began talking. It recounted all of the morally bankrupt things committed by His Majesty, finally declaring they were one in the same. In a reaction fueled by anger and paranoia, Patrick threw his fist and destroyed the mirror.<br><br>It was at that moment both the thread holding the aforementioned sword above the throne and Kenshii's house of cards he built a couple days prior fell apart, causing a mess to insue. After seeing what happened, Patrick screamed out of the castle, before collecting himself. Surely that was just a coincidence, right?<br><br>"
