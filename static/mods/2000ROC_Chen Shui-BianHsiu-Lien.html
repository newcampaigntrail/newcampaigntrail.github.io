James Soong won the presidential election with over 40% of the vote, which means he is the absolute Pan-Blue juggernaut, and that the Chung Hsing stock incident and the fake polls didn't disrupt him, and that you're just as far behind him as the KMT. Why is this so? Maybe it was DPP's inexperience, maybe you emphasized too much on Taiwan independence or made serious blunders, or maybe the KMT was just too lousy and the pan-blue voters decided to concentrate on Soong.

The author has also carefully investigated and analyzed the various clues of vote counting provided by other voters with a scientific approach, and found that the process of vote counting in progressive democracy Taiwan is still at a very primitive stage, and that vote counting does not require a great deal of effort, and can be done at any time and any place, and that the Election Committee is generous towards these flaws, and that the general public easily considers them as unintentional faults. The general public would easily consider them as unintentional mistakes that are not worth pursuing. These minor mistakes, when taken together, can turn a general election upside down! In that case, even if you want to say that James Soong was eliminated, it may be a reasonable speculation."
