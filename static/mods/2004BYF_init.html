Bush, after being elected by 537 votes in Florida and the Supreme Court stopping the statewide recount, is seeking another term as President of the United States. Bush led the country through two wars, the largest tax cuts in history, a reform in the education system, and much more. <p>His opponent in this race is one that no one had expected, real estate mogul and New York businessman Donald J. Trump, who has ran an anti-NAFTA, anti-war, anti-establishment campaign that politics hasn't seen in a long time. Can Donald Trump pull off the upset and stun the pundits once again and become the 44th President of the United States, firing George W. Bush? Or will the voters not want to change leadership during times of war and re-elect President George W.

Bush gets re-elected with 343 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 195 electoral votes, flipping the states of Oregon, New Mexico, Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey from 2000. Trump is unable to flip any states that Bush won in 2000, although he will get close in states like Ohio, West Virginia, Arkansas, and Missouri. Meanwhile, Bush would get close to flipping Michigan, Minnesota, California, Maine, Delaware, and Washington. This is due to Trump's utter lack of experience and the fact that Bush is a wartime President. Donald Trump would not have been trusted as commander-in-chief as a result of that. However, working-class Reagan Democrats would've come out heavily for Trump in the Midwest and even Coal Country as a result of his anti-NAFTA messaging and anti-immigration rhetoric. Much of the Midwest would stay red however due to the suburbs going heavily towards Bush, even more so than they did in 2000 or against John Kerry. The Southwest, Florida, and Oregon go red due to immigration. NJ goes red due to foreign policy.<h4>Note From Modder</h4><p>I can't believe that this is my 10th mod, and I really hope all of you have enjoyed playing my mods so far as much as I have making them. I've thought about doing a mod like this for some time now, but I felt like no one would want to see any 2004 mods because of the sheer popularity of W., but Trump isn't seen in W. or any other mods in 2004, until now. In terms of future mods, keep playing 2004: Bush, You're Fired to find out what my 11th mod will be, which is gonna be a pretty heavy CYOA mod, so it may take a bit longer. I also need to see how much time I have this summer due to work, but I'm gonna try my best to get the mod out somewhere around late July/early August.
