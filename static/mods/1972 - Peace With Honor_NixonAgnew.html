But McGovern was contending in Missouri, he'd made it too close to call, and it was there that the first glimpse of the Hope started flashing in the eyes of the younger staffers.<p><p>I'd gone up to the press room on the ninth floor to see the first results come in, but by midnight the dope I'd scored off some of the others hiding behind the curtains at the back of the room was wearing off and I needed a drink – a real drink – to get my nerves back in order.", "This whole night was the point of The Work – the point of moving to D.C., the point of following McGovern around from New Hampshire to California to Miami and all the rest – and I couldn't be missing The Work because of nerves. I wound up at the hotel bar where I told the bartender to give me the strongest bottle of whiskey under the counter and that I'd pay him back with the winnings I got from my bets that morning. I'd made one with Frank that McGovern would carry West Virginia, one with Gary that he'd carry Colorado, and one with the local bookie that McGovern would win at all, along with a dozen more with the other reporters on the Zoo Plane on counties, margins, the 49ers-Colts game that Sunday. . .</p>", "<p>I had tried to make a bet with McGovern that he'd take California, but he'd told me that a Serious Candidate shouldn't be taking bets on his own election, let alone be seen with a drug-crazed freak besides him in front of the other reporters. . .<p><p>By midnight I was three-quarters of the way through a bottle and into a tab of mescaline, looking up at the TV screens that, occasionally, would broadcast the big dining hall where everyone had set up to wait. <q>There's a real electricity in the air here at McGovern's HQ, where they've eagerly been watching for further movement towards the Senator... while in San Clemente we haven't been able to get hold of the President. . .and now we've heard that our desk has called Illinois, that McGovern is going to <i>win</i> in Illinois, and this crowd here in California is about to hear it. . .</q><p><p>", "Holy God, Illinois. The campaign had put Gene Pokorny, the Wisconsin wizard who had the best argument out of anyone on the staff for most valuable player in the early running, on Illinois, and he'd delivered again – without Daley, without Meany.

But it didn't matter. A hundred other journalists did Objective Journalism that night, and Objective Journalism was always my friend Raoul Duke's angle.</p>", "<p>What I got from that night was a <i>feeling</i> that I never thought I would have and, barring that night, have never had again – the feeling that I lived in Nixon's Ideal America, where the Good Guys won and stories ended, where the wicked and evil were driven from power with clubs and hammers and batons, where the hero gets his due and the villain, the crooked swine who surrounded himself with goons and criminals, who burnt through lives and decency and morality like firewood on Christmas, could be rejected by those he'd spent his whole life clawing and grasping and biting and gnashing for acceptance, for worship, for <i>respect</i> from.  From the moment the last state fell perfectly into place to the moment the papers hit the shelves the next morning, that feeling – the Hope – was inescapable, untouchable.

Today marks one year since the beginning of a coalition uniting this region, determined to aid desperate people against tyrannical regimes. After one year, we have made enormous progress. From the five years before this operation began, the communist Castro government refused entry to badly-needed humanitarian relief. It was like a stranglehold around an entire country. Our allies in the hemisphere and the United States could not stand idly by. Today, as our brave armed forces move forward near Camaguey, I would like a moment of silence for us to say a prayer for our troops.<p><p>[Silence]", "<p><p>PRESIDENT: Thank you.<p><p>REPORTER: Mr. President, the Nixon Library just put out a statement five minutes ago that former President Richard Nixon has passed away.

My thoughts are with the Nixon family, and I pray they are afforded privacy in this difficult moment. You know I served with President Nixon, as Ambassador to the United Nations, then as chair of the Republican National Committee, later Ambassador to what was then the Soviet Union, and finally as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I was all over government in those years, but what was always a constant was Richard Nixon. His presence was—it, well, it’s impossible to describe. He was a brilliant man, and watching him lead up close was indescribable.</p>", "I’ve been honored to receive his advice as president myself, and truly humbled by his incredible knowledge of world affairs. But, especially, uh Cuba. President Nixon was always determined—in a way his predecessors weren’t—on supporting a free Cuba, one rid of its cowardly totalitarian regime. He was devoted to the men who fought on the beaches in the Bay of Pigs invasion, and—I can say this as someone who knew him personally—was disgusted by what he regarded as a lack of will to follow through on that support from some corners in Washington. The greatest memorial to President Nixon would be a free Havana. I’ll certainly be attending the funeral, and I can’t speak to former President Rumsfeld or President Brown, but I know they valued President Nixon’s advice as much as I did.</p>"]

As long as Nixon was politically alive -- and he was, all the way to the end -- we could always be sure of finding the enemy on the Low Road. There was no need to look anywhere else for the evil bastard. He had the fighting instincts of a badger trapped by hounds. The badger will roll over on its back and emit a smell of death, which confuses the dogs and lures them in for the traditional ripping and tearing action. But it is usually the badger who does the ripping and tearing. It is a beast that fights best on its back: rolling under the throat of the enemy and seizing it by the head with all four claws.", "<p><p>That was Nixon's style -- and if you forgot, he would kill you as a lesson to the others. Badgers don't fight fair, bubba. That's why God made dachshunds.<p><p>If the right people had been in charge of Nixon's funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.</p>", "Kissinger was only one of the many historians who suddenly came to see Nixon as more than the sum of his many squalid parts. He seemed to be saying that History will not have to absolve Nixon, because he has already done it himself in a massive act of will and crazed arrogance that already ranks him supreme, along with other Nietzschean supermen like Hitler, Jesus, Bismarck and the Emperor Hirohito. These revisionists have catapulted Nixon to the status of an American Caesar, claiming that when the definitive history of the 20th century is written, no other president will come close to Nixon in stature. <q>He will dwarf FDR and Truman,</q> according to one scholar from Duke University.", "<p><p>It was all gibberish, of course. Nixon was no more a Saint than he was a Great President. He was more like Sammy Glick than Winston Churchill. He was a cheap crook and a merciless war criminal who bombed more people to death in Laos and Cambodia than the U.S. Army lost in all of World War II, and he denied it to the day of his death. When students at Kent State University, in Ohio, protested the bombing, he connived to have them attacked and slain by troops from the National Guard.</p>", "Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.", "He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.", "- Hunter S.

Nixon, embittered, complicated, and irascible as ever, serves as one of the major players as does Shirley Chisholm, at once filled with the hopes of a new generation and a crushing knowledge of real life’s disappointments. Also appearing are Nixon’s “ogre” H.R. Haldeman, the creeping Henry Kissenger, preening future presidents Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown, and an at times exhausting list of the capital’s who’s who. Some Washington area lawyers may be surprised to find constitutional expert Hillary Rodham given not just a passing reference, but an extensive viewpoint chapter that delves into her memories of the Watergate inquiry and as an aide in the Chisholm administration.</p>", "While younger readers and some unfamiliar outsiders may want to keep an eEncyclopedia close by to keep up-to-speed on the more confusing details of the era, “Dick and Shirley” is a page-turner that is at once witty and deeply tragic. Hagen writes with such wit and psychological acuity that many will find themselves sympathizing with characters once thought clown-like or monstrous. Still others will read the book and wonder what might have been had America not treated them with contempt, but genuine empathy and understanding.<p></p>★★★★½"]

A long-time member of the Secret Service, Endicott considered his presence on that day to be a footnote, purely to keep any “kooks” and “weirdos”—as he called them—from the president as he defended himself against allegations of impropriety over the alleged break-in at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, DC.</p>", "<p>Today, Endicott, 79, spends most of his days wondering if he should have paid less attention to the crowd and closer attention to the man giving the speech.<p><p>“He was standing right there,” said Mr. Endicott, pointing at a discrete “X” in the Ballroom of the Americas at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. He and his grandson had been invited as part of a 50th anniversary memorial service. “He looked so tired when he got off the stage, but he was always tired in those days. I wish I had said something. It still hurts to remember.</p>", "<p>In Washington, the surviving principals of the Administration and its scandals offered similar reflections.<p>“A sad day,” former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said when reached by dmail.<p></p>“The unfortunate result of an ill-gotten presidency,” said former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean.</p>", "<p><b>A Different Time</b><p>For many older Americans, the days leading up to President Nixon’s death have inspired not morbid interest, as the Kennedy Assassination does, but pain. Even fictionalized portrayals of the former president—most notably Oliver Stone’s 1992 made-for-television movie Nixon—have sparked protests and outcry.<p>", "</p>Still, the contours of the story are well-known. As revealed on later-recovered tapes, a much closer-than expected race against the young, black Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm sent the president spiraling. Leaks, congressional investigations into the Watergate break-in, the resignation of his vice president, family discord, and a growing list of indictments against key aides led to a further deterioration of the president’s mental state. By November 1973—with the collapse of the Paris Peace Accords and Israel’s use of nuclear weapons amid the Second Arab-Israeli War—most mainstream historians describe a president “unmoored,” frequently drunk or depressed and unable to respond to crises.</p>", "<p>Much of this would go unnoticed by the public until the morning of Nov. 23, 1973, when newly sworn-in president Carl Albert informed a shocked public that President Nixon had taken his life in the White House the prior evening. His remarks and the revelations that followed the Berger Commission’s investigations into the death, would lead to an uncomfortable reckoning with the Nixon Administration’s extensive criminality, the toll of public office on high-ranking officials, and the state of American mental health care.<p></p>“I don’t think any of us could have expected it at the time. I mean, we just didn’t have those kinds of conversations back then,” offered Elizabeth Drew, one of the leading chroniclers of the Watergate scandal. “It’s hard to explain what it was like to young people.”</p>", "<b>Somber Reflections</b><p>While a handful of conservative activists—chief among them Pat Buchanan and Roger Stone—continue to allege a lurid conspiracy by the CIA and disgruntled federal workers to kill the president, recent polls suggest Americans are ready to move on.<p></p>One recent miniphone survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center found that some 83% of all adults accept the Berger Commission’s findings and convictions against the Watergate suspects. Less than 6% of Americans agree with theories that President Ted Kennedy was involved in the president’s passing—a number that could reflect Kennedy’s historically high approval ratings during his two terms and continued praise by mainstream historians for his “politics of empathy.”", "</p>The survey further noted about 64% of Americans support the National Mental Health Service, a landmark program pioneered by the Ted Kennedy Administration. One in five adults are believed to receive mental health support through the NMHS, NHS, or a private plan.<p></p>In places like New York City, however, the focus was less on political battles of yesteryear and more on the man at the center of the tragedy.</p>", "<p>“We must change those things that we can and accept that which we cannot,” said former Vice President and First Lady Elizabeth Dole at an international vigil in New York for those suffering untreated conditions. “Whether you’re man or woman, Republican or Democrat, American or Soviet, let us continue to fight for a kinder, gentler world.”<p></p>It was the one-time president’s daughter Julie who got the last word, though. In an emotional speech, where she often seemed on the verge of tears, the 75-year-old told the crowd, “I wish I’d known what my father was going through. I wish I could go back and tell him that it would all be alright, that no matter what he or his staff did, we could get through this together.”</p>", "<p>“Daddy, wherever you are, I love you.” She continued. “I hope you know I’ll never stop loving you.”"]

How does the President respond to these allegations?</p>", "<p>GS: Thank you for your question. The President has made it clear that he is not going to dignify these baseless and malicious accusations with a response. He has always been honest and transparent with the American people about who he is and what he stands for, and as you all know, he's been married to his wife Bess for 10 years today, and they have a loving and supportive relationship.

President Nixon was a great leader who shaped America as we knew it and will be missed dearly. He had a long and distinguished career in public service, both as a congressman, a senator, a vice president, and a president.

Eurocommunist parties have surged at the expense of traditional parties across the EU, even forming a majority government in Italy. Popular rebellions have led to the collapse of long-established governments across the third world, from the Philippines to South Korea to South Africa. Even the popularity of Premier Jiang Qing has supposedly been slipping. But, in spite of it all, polling has indicated that upwards of 60% of the public has registered trust in their government to ‘do the right thing’ always or most of the time, similar to the numbers seen during the Kennedy and Eisenhower administrations, with the policies to match.</p>", "<p>What accounts for the American public being seemingly frozen in time? Established political science literature from the historicist school points to two discrete moments: President Nixon’s ‘confession’ during the 1972 election, and President Humphrey’s resignation due to failing health in early 1976. These moments, as the story goes, were brave, heroic acts of great moral character that showed Americans that even those with everything on the line will put the good of the country first. Other factors, like the resolute leadership shown by President Jackson during the South American Crisis, are said to have contributed to this, too, but the upshot is still the same: a defining characteristic of modern American political culture derives solely from historical contingency. </p>", "<p>As we work to make political science into a more rigorous, scientifically legitimate discipline, I believe that it is ideas like this that we must fight against first and foremost. The influence of the historicists is strong, but, like the insurgents who fought against Torrijos and Allende to maintain the status quo in their Canal, we must never give up, even against insurmountable odds. In this article, I posit that the high level of public trust among the American public is not a result of mere chance, but is in fact the logical outcome of the structure of American institutions. Through the decision-making structure created by checks and balances, a weak two-party system, and a strong, state-based upper house, American politicians are given powerful incentives to act with good behavior. Practically, as we continue the Global Restructuring programme, this understanding of the strengths of our system should influence how we redesign rouge governments following police actions.<p><p><i>The Institutional Foundations of Public Trust</i>, Terry M.

And it looks like he's a better sorcerer than he was a president, because this sure was a promise made, promise kept. His VP was a gimme, of course, and sad sack Gerry would’ve been, too, if the President of the Jodie Foster Fan Club didn’t throw in the towel for him at the finish line. Edwin squeaked by on the heartbreak, and we all heard the guffaws coming from Yorba Linda when he was straight-up, no-contest convicted.", "Poor old Dianne, our third Golden Stater in ten years, never had a hope after that. Jack ran up the score on Her Excellency until His Excellency was thrown out of the game by Lloyd, the latest hick we call the President.<p>What to make of this bunch? Dr. Kissinger has taken to calling them the <q>absentee Presidents,</q> architects of an <q>absentee America.</q> I, dear reader, agree, and ask: is that really such a bad thing? What’s so sad about this lack of leadership? Am I supposed to be scared to see China reaching out to the world again? Are people dying in the streets of San Francisco because Grenada got rid of the Queen? And does anyone really care, ten years after the fact, that we gave up a goddamn lease in the jungle? Maybe a little benign neglect was just what the doctor ordered for the rest of the world. And, let’s be honest: there’s no curse. Our Presidents are one-termers and half-termers because America is a one-term and half-term country. This is the nation of TV dinners, MTV, fast food. Steady leadership isn’t in our attention span. So, sorry, <i>Herr Doktor</i>, but you’re probably gonna see Lloyd swapped with Bob, and Bob swapped with Mario, and Mario swapped with whoever-the-hell. It’s just our DNA. And the human race is better off for it."]

Well, as we go through the rest of this convention, I think it’s important to take a second to look back at how far we have come. We’ve accomplished a lot together, as a party, since the last time we came together four years ago. I have been so proud to stand with you all in our fight for strong families, strong values, and a strong national checkbook, even through the hard—<p>[Some booing]", "—even in the moments where we had to make hard decisions, yes. But I also think it’s all too fitting to take a moment to honor the passing of one of our party’s greatest men, a great Californian, President Nixon. I was honored to call him a great friend and mentor, and his advice was indispensable to me at all of the critical moments during my time in office. When the Soviets attacked those fighting for the cause of freedom in Afghanistan and Southern Africa. When the lawless government in Peking tried to buy their way into recognition. When so many stood against us in our fight to bring justice to a lawless dictator and take an American canal back for Americans, President Nixon was always there, just a phone call away, with the kind of wisdom that only comes from a life of doing what’s right.<p>[Some cheers]", "Thank you, thank you.

But we must not let the first convention any of us can remember without the man so many of us simply called <q>The President</q> also be the moment the Grand Old Party stepped away from his legacy.
