Call it Ron Paul’s radicalism, call it Limbaugh’s vote stealing, Kerry didn’t care. He had won. In the face of a failed first term and an economic disaster not seen since the 30s, Kerry had been found worthy to continue his mission.</p>
                <p>The Senate was surely flipped to his favor, and the House would no doubt find itself more purple. A real national renewal could begin, even if Kerry didn’t have much time to try and pull it off. Medicare expansion, green energy, social justice - he had his work cut out for him.

His multilateral foreign policy had gone a long way into rebuilding the credibility of the United States. The recession had been handled about as well as it could be.

It was four years late to the party, but the Senate could finally be more friendly to his agenda. Of course, even if it was outright blue, he had his work ahead of him.

Bush's speech in 2003 declaring ‘’the end of major combat operations in Iraq’’, and a ‘mission accomplished’’. We know, with hindsight, that the declaration was foolhardy, and came too early, which leads us to ask - can we be sure that President Kerry’s similar declaration, assuring Americans that ‘’we are ready, now, to put this war behind us’’ isn’t of the exact same vein?</p>
                <p>For starters, combat deaths have reached an absolute minimum, for both Iraqi and American combatants - only 7 Americans were KIA in 2009, contrasted with 31 insurgent deaths. This is credited to a significant decrease in insurgent capabilities and in hostile sentiment between Americans and Iraqis. The Iraqi Ground Forces have, in recent months, proven more than able to keep order in the countryside and defeat what insurgent forces remain.</p>
                <p>But a lasting peace needs more than military victory - it needs political stability as well, which the government of President Talabani and Prime Minister Allawi will have to demonstrate in the coming months and years if Iraq is to truly thrive.</p>

Kerry offered something that resembled a smile back. Ron Paul, the most dangerous man to run for office since Lyndon LaRouche, had managed to pull it off. Kerry was going to go down in history as the man that failed to stop Ron Paul, and that was the end of things. After a few minutes of silence, he shakily tried to call Paul to get the concession over with, but he got no answer. No doubt rapturous with joy, Paul was already plotting on how he could circumvent the whatever loose restrictions the GOP tried to chain him with.</p>
            <p>Dear god, where did he go wrong? Did he really have no chance after the bubble popped? Was he too liberal? Not liberal enough? Was America really desperate for its own destruction? He looked back on the campaign, and saw countless missed opportunities. He had so many regrets, and regrets were all he was going to be left with.</p>
            <p>He stepped up to the podium to concede, and looked past the crowd. He called for more understanding, for calm after such a tense election. He couldn’t look anyone in the crowd in the eye.</p>

            <p>Trust, but verify.’ In the words of our greatest President, that has been the Log Cabin Republicans stance on Ron Paul. And while his presidency has been very far from perfect, with some foreign policy missteps, we still recognise Ron Paul as a very promising step forward to our goal of making gay issues a dead issue in the Republican party. Mr. Paul is perhaps the most pro-LGBT president in American history. His unprecedented overtures to the LGBT community —a first for any candidate in our nation’s history — are worthy of praise, and should serve as a clarion call to the GOP that the days of needing to toe an anti-LGBT line are now a thing of the past.</p>
            <p>In particular, his idea to remove the federal government from marriage entirely, straight or gay, is a brilliant compromise on the issue that is perfectly aligned with our values of shrinking the government to focus on individual liberty.</p>
            <p>We must renounce, in the harshest possible terms, Mr. Santorum’s efforts to try to dredge up the past. He seeks to return to an era of big government conservatism isn’t real conservatism, and his virulent bigotry alienates the moderates Paul has been so successful in attracting.</p>
            <p>To President Paul - we are eager to help continue your work to shrink the government, and preserve and expand our valuable majority.</p>

            <p>Despite his early relief when Ron Paul was nominated, losing wasn’t a big surprise. A first term that was nothing but a failed struggle coupled with a near unprecedented economic disaster meant that even the weakest opponent would be made strong enough to beat him.</p>
            <p>He knew this in his head. But his heart still broke as more and more states were called for Paul, and his rejection made resolute. There was nothing he could have done to improve things, the crash made him electoral poison. That was to be his legacy, a Herbert Hoover that led to the nightmare scenario of Ron Paul.</p>
            <p>There was a certain freeing sensation in his ultimate failure - the terror was a fact, in the same way the sky is blue. He gave Paul a call, tersely congratulating him and going through the motions. He went to his podium, and prattled on about the importance of healing after the divisive election. He knew Hillary Clinton was already plotting to rail against Paul - if Edwards had much of a future, he would be plotting the same. These convincing types were going to be the future. He was going to be a shameful past for a party that evolved past him.</p>

            <p>One year after American forces pulled out from Iraq, restrictive policies enforced by the unrecognized government of ISIS have drastically restricted basic rights, and brought their daily lives to a halt. One woman, speaking to MSNBC on condition of strict anonymity, described their plight. ''This is a man’s country. Women do not have good opportunities anymore. Before, I was able to live without my hijab. Now, were I to do that, men would come and beat my brother until he forced me to wear one.''</p>
            <p>This backslide in civil rights has been exacerbated by Supreme Leader al-Baghdadi’s declaration that public stoning for crimes like adultery will return, defiantly saying ''You say it’s a violation of women’s rights when we stone them to death (...) but we will soon implement it as a punishment for adultery. Women will be stoned publicly. Women will be flogged publicly.'' Prime David Cameron of Britain described the restoration of these 90s era punishment as ''one of the most morally abhorrent and heartbreaking backslides in civil rights in the last century'' while Chancellor Merkel has called on the European Union to unite against the ''backwards and evil theocracy.''</p>
            <p>The White House has issued no statement - Press Secretary Rachel Mills has described the backsliding as unfortunate, but irrelevant to America and its interests. The president himself has offered ''thoughts and prayers''' and seems to believe that will be satisfactory enough to women America has abandoned with its pullout.</p>
            <p>The thoughts and prayers will need to help the women of Iraq, who have watched any hope for a brighter future be snatched away with the messy pull-out. Fortunately for these women, Senator Obama has been working with Senator Biden to draft legislation to try and help women escape Iraq to America - but with the Senate majority in the hands of the Republicans, who knows the future of the refugee bill.</p>

            <p>The results weren’t really a surprise. He had seen what the polls said, and didn’t expect to win. But he assumed the worst of them was just anger at the economy and the war. America was still a sane nation. It didn’t actually want the madness Ron Paul represented inflicted on him. As he heard more states called for Paul, he laughed some more at his prior naivete. Four years of failure, and another four years of nightmares. He supposed it was fair enough.</p>
            <p>Kerry knew what he was supposed to do. He was supposed to call Ron Paul, and congratulate him on a hard fought campaign. Then he was to go on stage and tell everyone to support the lunatic that had won. He didn’t care. He told Cahill to issue a statement conceding the election, and left the party early. He would work with the transition staff tomorrow - for now, he just wanted to rest.</p>

            <p>The US government has begun a partial shutdown after the two houses of Congress failed to agree on a new budget.</p>
            <p>The Democratic House of Representatives have clashed with President Ron Paul on the budget. In Paul’s inaugural address, he promised that he would not sign a budget that did not shrink the US government. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pledged to try and compromise with President Paul, while not compromising vital services. After weeks of negotiations, no deal has been reached. Pelosi has called the President’s demands ‘unworkable’, while the President has described himself as ''satisfied by the end, compromise or not.'' The original deal included, leaked in a memo, would have included a 20% reduction in funds for Social Security, a 30% reduction for SNAP, a 10% reduction in military funding and a 50% cut to the PEPFAR program. Updates as they come.</p>
            <p>Update: the White House has published his new demands. The full memo has been posted on social media, but key parts are: a 40% reduction in Social Security spending, a 60% reduction in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) spending, and a total end to President Bush's key African initiative, PEPFAR.</p>
            <p>In the memo, the White House claims that a total government shutdown is ‘an accomplishment of President Paul’s goals to shrink the government.’ Speaker Pelosi has not issued a comment.</p>
