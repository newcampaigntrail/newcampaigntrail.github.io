And it’s not hard to see why. Polls have consistently ranked him as 10+ points behind Bob Casey Jr, and the media has always had it out for this rising star of conservatism. But if anything, I think it’s clear that Santorum has a legitimate path to victory.</p><p>Firstly, the proper, post labor-day campaign hasn’t even begun, and it’s a campaign Casey is not prepared for. Thanks to sharing his father’s name (an ACTUAL moderate, mind you), the guy has never faced a tough general election in his life, jumping from Auditor General to Treasurer. If anyone has the strength to defeat the Casey name, it’s Santorum.</p><p>Secondly, as I alluded to in my previous point, Bob Casey is far too liberal for the state and has serious baggage. He’s refused to support a full on abortion ban, and has supported the unpopular immigration bill making its way through Congress. These are legitimate issues he refuses to address, for some reason.</p><p>Finally, and this is the part everyone forgets: Santorum knows how to win. He won when Al Gore won Pennsylvania by 4 points, and he beat Wofford as a freshman in Congress. He’s a tough campaigner, and if he can pull this off, well, 2007 will be a breeze ;) </p>`)

Inspired by the release of Liberalism’s Requiem, I’m pleased to announce an alt-history scenario. Irl of course, Kerry impressively won against Bush in a war, before being thrown out in 2008 by McCain. Liberalism’s Requiem really shows how different could have been, like if Kerry had followed the Merkel Doctrine instead of flip flopping again. But what if, in 2004, Bush had won?</p><p>The PoD is simple. Irl Kerry gained a lot of mileage drawing attention to the fact he won Three Purple Hearts. In this timeline, he was only wounded once. So when he says Bush is handling Iraq badly, people don’t think he’s credible, and so he loses. Bush does basically the same Iraq policy as Kerry but keeps taxes low. These low taxes mean that when the recession hits, the public has more money so it’s not as bad. So the GOP isn’t as unpopular as John Kerry was.</p><p>The GOP of course nominated Vice-President Dick Cheney. The true mind behind the Bush administration, he’s recognised as having the ability to keep the economy 	tolerable for most voters and keeping Iraq safe. For his running mate, he chose Governor Mitt Romney. IRL Mitt Romney became very conservative in the 2008 primary but before that he was actually a liberal Republican like Rockefeller, which is important to Cheney because he has a gay daughter. Because Cheney is the vice-president, Romney doesn’t try to appeal to conservatives in the primary.</p><p>The Democrats, angry they lost in 2004, have chosen to embrace being anti-war with Dennis Kucinich. He’s a very liberal anti-war candidate, like George McGovern, and a lot of people think he’s too liberal. The establishment are worried about him so his running mate is ‘’Lion of the Senate’’ Ted Kennedy, who isn’t as liberal and is more experienced which compliments Dennis Kucinich.</p><p>Need writers and coders.</p>`)

In his announcement, he said; ‘’I have always counted Teddy Roosevelt as a political icon of mine and I’ve sought to emulate his style of politics wherever possible.

It’s the man in the arena who counts, and I intend fight like I’m in an arena.’’</p><p>Press Secretary Jen Psaki issued a statement following the announcement, saying that ‘’the President is a Democrat, and will support the democratic nominee.
