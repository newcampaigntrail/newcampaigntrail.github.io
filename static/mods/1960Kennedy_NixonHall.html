Like there was some kind of magic spell, and speaking will destroy it and make Kennedy win.</p><p>When the candidate takes the stage however, all hell breaks loose. The crowd’s pent up energy is released and screams of ‘’WE WANT NIXON! WE WANT NIXON!’’ echo loud enough to shake the hotel. It’s not clear when they’ll end; Nixon gestures several times to try and begin speaking, but he is offered no reprieve.</p><p>You slip out of the hotel, and take in the cold air and relative quiet. Leading a campaign that’s produced these kinds of results has certainly improved your stock in the party.</p><p>Returning to the Party Chair will be a cinch.

Yeah. Fuck’em. You're off the clock for a little while. The party at the Ambassador Hotel is predictably upbeat, and it’s good to cut loose for a while. You shake hands with managers and thank them for their hard work - few approach you, because why would they? That’s never been how you operate, save the odd flight of fantasy.</p><p>The man of the hour only finally shows himself a while later, smiling and waving with an unusual warmth, clutching Pat’s arm. He’s letting his natural awkwardness show, unable to mask it, he’s so delighted. As he talks about his plans for the future, you think about your own plans for the future. For as much as naysayers will say this victory was lesser than Eisenhower’s, Kennedy was no Stevenson, and the right people will respect that. There could be a very influential job for the White House waiting for you…</p><p>…hardly. If you really wanted one, perhaps you could get one, but if you ever have to meet Nixon again, you’ll likely scream. He’s a hard worker, but God. Still, Morton has indicated that he doesn’t intend to remain chair of the GOP for too long. With your resume, and backing from Nixon, returning to that office and shaping the future of the GOP’s politics has an appeal. After all, winning over the South doesn’t <i>have</i> to lose you the North.</p><p>This business talk is making you feel too sober. You sneak off during Nixon’s speech, and grab another drink.</p></div>`;

<h3><q>Racial integration is not going to be accepted in the South.</q>
</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p>Well, damn. This was on the peripheral, but our options were rather limited in dealing with it. The Dixiecrats have managed to prevent us or Kennedy from crossing 270 electoral votes with that unpledged electors business. You're mostly trying to keep the peace at the party - Nixon hasn’t shown hair or hide since the results came through.</p><p>As much as you would like to help, the South has been a pet project for you for some time, that really isn’t much you can do as an organiser. You’re not leading the charge on policy, so you don’t have authority to direct compromises, and you’re out of Congress, so you don’t really have any sway over the Congressmen. All you can really do is serve as an advisor should someone call on you.</p><p>The best bet, you suspect, would be contacting the faithless electors and hashing out a deal before they meet in December - crossing that 270 line without throwing the election to the House. This would be easier than the House entering a contingent election, especially with the current make up of the House, but it would likely do a lot of harm to the Nixon Presidency going in. Betting on the contingent would be a risk, but it would be better for the Presidency.</p><p>In any case, the future is concerning. You’ll have time to really think things through when Nixon finally shows himself to the crowd.</p></div>`;

<h3><q>If the present trend continues, Mr. Kennedy, Senator Kennedy will be the next President of the United States.</q>
</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p>The party at the Hotel has come to an end for you. This cuts deep. You had <i>begged</i> the Boss to go to Illinois, or Texas, or not fucking Alaska, but the cards were dealt and you lost. Nixon is god only knows in this hotel, preparing his concession remarks, but you’ve got a meeting with Finch and Morton.</p><p>You break the initial silence. ‘’Look, these results aren’t bad. We ran a good campaign. We don’t repeat the 50 state strategy but we don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater here.’’</p><p>The silence permeates. Finally, Finch speaks. ‘’Nixon could have spent every waking minute in Illinois. I don’t think that changes the returns in Cook County.’’</p><p>Morton nods and adds to it. ‘’And a man like Lyndon Johnson - we all know Box 13. Who’s to say he didn’t do it again? The stakes are certainly high enough.’’</p><p>Hrm. ‘’I think this is a road that isn’t worth going down, gentlemen. Despite what Senator Johnson thinks, he doesn’t run Texas. We have some good things going on there. I don’t think it’s in the interests of the party to… pursue that.’’</p><p>Morton rolls his drink in his hands and Finch puffs on a cigarette. Eventually, Finch speaks. “The Boss has no intention of denying results. You know, practically, it’s not working. We’d need President Kennedy’s help in sending federal investigators to Chicago. It’s not feasible. But we can’t just say stealing elections is ok.’’</p><p>‘’Then what do you propose we say?’’</p><p>Morton interjects. ‘’We make it clear that we accept the results, but they are not legitimate.’’</p><p>‘’What’s the point of that?’’</p><p>‘’It causes a headache. Kennedy is going to be planning out all kinds of silliness once he takes office. We can cause an issue for him if we raise a fuss, and let the GOP look noble for ‘62 if we accept it.’’ He stops speaking for a minute, waiting for you to speak. When you remain silent, he continues. ‘’There’s a whole host of other states that are suspicious. South Carolina, Delaware, Michigan. Enough to reverse the election.’’</p><p>You nod. ‘’How does the Boss feel about this?’’</p><p>Finch responds immediately. ‘’Do you think I would be here if he didn’t approve?’’</p><p>The discussion continues into the night. The campaign is over, but politics never rests. Kennedy’s childish policies may have to be picked and chosen should the plan be successful. Nixon, for his part, has somewhat but not fully conceded the election, and will play the bigger man. It’s a dirty trick. But politics is rarely a clean job.</p></div>`;

<h3><q>Now that all the members of the press are so delighted that I have lost, I'd like to make a statement of my own.</q>
</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p>Ah.</p><p>This result is pretty humiliating. You know the campaign would likely lose with the 50 state strategy, but this kind of result isn’t produced by key error. There was a complete failure, strategically and tactically. While Nixon is the de jure campaign manager, this was your role de facto. Finch will stay around as Nixon’s liaison, and Morton has Kentucky, you’ll likely be due for a hard landing in New York. Maybe you could return to the House of Representatives? If Rockefeller permits it, at least.</p><p>Nixon enters the stage, in one of those moods. You decide to skip out of the speech, though it’s probably a delightful one, and take a walk in the darkness. Kennedy is likely delighted that he’s going to have the chance to buy his way to winning elections and inflating the economy big enough to burst. And while Morton will be fine overall, his position as chair of the party is certainly at risk - in all likelihood, an ambitious conservative like Ford or Miller will unseat him, and make winning the midterms even harder.</p><p>The future looks depressing, but failure usually is.</p></div>`;
