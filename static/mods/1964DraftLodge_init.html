Let them present their case, we ours, and let the voters decide</q></i><p>A war hero, an ambassador, a former senator, a legacy, and now nominee for President of the United States, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. (or just <q>Cabot</q> to those who know him) has kept busy since Richard Nixon and himself narrowly lost the 1960 election nearly four years ago. He has served as the International Chairman of the Institute of International Education, worked as a consultant on international affairs for Time Inc, served as the first Director General for the Atlantic Institute for International Affairs, and most recently crossed party lines at the request of the late President Kennedy to serve as the US Ambassador to South Vietnam.</p><p>Despite his national popularity and a direct call to action by President Eisenhower, Lodge had no plans to seek the Presidency before or after last November’s events in Dallas, as he believed his skills would better serve the nation through continuing in his role as Ambassador. This disinterest did not stop the creation of a <q>Draft Lodge</q> campaign in early January which, to the shock of the Ambassador, swept the New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Massachusetts primaries.</p><p>After continued personal appeals from Eisenhower paired with an even more unexpected upset in the West Virginia primary (enabled by the <q>Draft Lodge</q> organization successfully maneuvering Lodge onto the ballot) resulting in the withdrawal of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller from the race, Lodge finally agreed to resign his post and personally throw his hat into the ring just two days before the Oregon primary—which he handedly won. By the time of the convention in early July and with the moderates of the party coalescing behind him, Lodge won over enough delegates to overcome the campaign of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and secure the nomination on the third ballot.</p><p>Lodge must now work to leverage his long-standing moderation and international policy experience without further alienating the party’s increasingly dissatisfied conservative wing if he is to maintain any hope of victory.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#b50300\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#d9262b\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://github.com/TedThing/Images/blob/main/LodgeProfile.jpg?raw=true\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": null, \"candidate_score\": 0.666}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 24, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Lyndon Baines\", \"last_name\": \"Johnson\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"Democrat\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"priority\": 2, \"description\": \"<p>.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#000344\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#2e396b\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \".\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": null, \"candidate_score\": 1.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 25, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Edwin Anderson\", \"last_name\": \"Walker\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"American Conservative\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"priority\": 3, \"description\": \"<p>.</p>\", \"color_hex\": \"#444100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#6B602E\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \".\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"null\", \"candidate_score\": 0.7}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 57, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Paul J.\", \"last_name\": \"Fannin\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"Republican\", \"state\": \"Arizona\", \"priority\": 5, \"description\": \"\", \"color_hex\": \"#FF0000\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#FFA0A0\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://github.com/TedThing/Images/blob/main/FanninPortrait.jpg?raw=true\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\",  \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<div style=\\\"overflow-y:scroll;height:200.133px;font-size:1;\\\"><i><q>Let the other fellow have the credit, if that’s going to get the job done</q></i><p>Paul Fannin is a well respected member of the conservative wing of the GOP and has served as the Governor of Arizona since 1959. If selected, it would be hard for one to miss Fannin’s close connection to Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater—your top challenger for the nomination—and his inclusion on the ticket would surely help you win back a number of the conservatives who are less than enthusiastic about supporting you this year.</p><p>During his time as Governor, Fannin has displayed a capacity for bipartisan cooperation with a Democratic legislature, a capacity which you think could come in handy considering you will still be likely to have one (should you win), and his support for an increase in Arizona’s sales taxes to fund education reform suggests that you may be able to convince him to support you (or at least not outwardly oppose you) in maintaining most remaining New Deal programs against his own wing’s opposition. This could help to minimize the risk of intra-ticket infighting that hangs over any campaign made up of members from opposing wings of a party.</p><p>Fannin is not without his downsides however, as his aforementioned close ties with Goldwater would leave you more vulnerable than you would be otherwise to attacks seeking to paint you as a right-wing radical or at least an enabler of them, as absurd as that is. This, paired with his connections to the natural gas industry, may weaken your support in the North and East to an extent that may negate any increased support you may seek to gain in the West and Upper South.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.7}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 63, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Robert A.\", \"last_name\": \"Taft\", \"election\": 4, \"party\": \"Republican\", \"state\": \"Ohio\", \"priority\": 7, \"description\": \"\", \"color_hex\": \"#FF0000\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#FFA0A0\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://github.com/TedThing/Images/blob/main/TaftPortrait.jpg?raw=true\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \".\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \".\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \".\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<div style=\\\"overflow-y:scroll;height:200.133px;font-size:1;\\\"><i><q>I have never tried to pattern myself after my father</q></i><p>Robert A.

This mod would've been a ton worse without you.", "", "Thanks as well to the other playtesters /u/Tom1923, neo, snazzrazzmazzlejazz, ordep, & Gardfeld (/u/Gardfeld). Your feedback on answer effects, writing, writing structure, lore, gameplay, and/or your own general enjoyment all really helped make this mod the best it could be.", "Thanks to ItsAstronomical for their amazing modding guide that I frequently consulted (especially for endings) and for letting me launch the mod directly on the loader!", "Thanks again to Gardfeld (/u/Gardfeld) and also Jake Dionysos (/u/jake_dionysos) for providing the issue scores from Midnight 1964, thanks to Liquid Astro (/u/astrohunch_o) for their TNCT Blog/Column that drew my attention to elements of coding I may not have otherwise prioritized, thanks to /u/SkipperPengin and 1924b for the inspiration for the epilogue format, and thanks to Obummer and 1968Romney for the credits code I'm currently using."]
