              <p>There was screaming inside the Reagan Building in Downtown DC. First the South had fallen. Then the Great Plains. Great splotches of red spread across the map, conquest after conquest, victory after victory. They felt themselves on the edge of a precipice and then, finally, shortly past midnight, they passed it. There were still votes to be counted, ballot boxes to be retrieved, but according to their projections: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had won re-election. There were whistles like falling rockets. Each round of applause was sharp and percussive. The masses waved their flags.<br><br>He could hear the roars from his green room and felt a certain sense of satisfaction from the triumph. After all, their victory had been far from assured two years ago. Back then, it seemed as though the entire country were coming apart, as if all they had fought for would be lost. It had taken a skilled captain to right the ship of state, to navigate through the rocks of scandal and stupidity, but he had done it. Dick Cheney had found a  weak-willed wisp of a man and turned him into a conqueror. <br><br>Dick allowed himself a brief moment to imagine his running mate scurrying about his green room, soaking in the adulation. He imagined him calling his “Poppy”—a babyish name—and presenting the victory to him like a child presenting a report card. Didn’t I do such a good job? Aren’t you proud of me, Poppy?    <br><br>He snorted at his own joke and then, rising from his chair, flipped open his Blackberry. There was a short ring, followed by a click.<br><br>“I suppose congratulations are in order, Dick,” said the voice on the other end of the receiver.<br><br>“Yeah, I guess so,” he grunted. “Listen, Paul, once things settle down, I want to make sure we can set up a meeting to discuss the Russia business.”<br><br>He paused as a particularly loud round of cheers exploded in the distant auditorium.<br>“Putin hasn’t, uh, caused too much trouble for us, but I think you and I both know he’s not going to stay content in his playpen for long.”<br><br>Dick listened to the sound of Wolfowitz moving around his study, muting a television. “I uhh… I suppose that would probably be a good idea, Dick.” There was a light chuckle. “After Afghanistan. The whole UN thing. He hasn’t been willing to play ball.”<br><br>“I don’t think he realizes what a favor he did us by tearing up that Arms Treaty.” Dick adjusted his glasses. “Let’s plan for something sometime next week with the usual group. Ari. Rumsfeld. McNally. I want us to get things in order for the…” He cleared his throat. “Final victory.”<br><br>There was scribbling on the other end of the receiver. “Sure, sure. Shouldn’t be too hard. Do you want to finally loop in George on this?”<br><br>Dick Cheney paused for a moment while he pretended to think. “No, I don’t think we should worry him about this yet. He’s going to want to take some time for a victory lap. Let’s, uh, keep the lights on for him.” Dick looked at his watch. “Anyways, I should probably get going to handle the lunatics here. Don’t stay up too late, Paul.”<br><br>“Only long enough to watch you both accept your victory. Good night, Dick.”<br><br>There was a click as the call ended. Alone in his dressing room, Dick allowed himself a moment to straighten his tie and pull back his shoulders. He tried to make himself look as powerful as he felt before swinging open the door to his green room and striding towards his smiling wife, children, and grandchildren. They were effusive with praise, talking about his victory over Sharpton, but he was already thinking about his next great victory. He was still thinking about it as he stepped out before the screaming crowd. He could almost see it in their rapt, attentive faces.<br><br>He was sure he was the only one who could.</p>`)

              <p>George felt strange standing inside the elementary school classroom. It was not just the size of the chairs and desks, which left him feeling enormous and plodding, nor the colorful decorations pasted against white cement walls. It was a… synchronicity, he thought, surprising himself with the word. A sense of deja vu. Staring at a dry erase board covered in a teacher’s careful scrawl, he felt like he had lived this moment before.<br><br>The feeling scared him. He cleared his throat and ignored the uniformed military aide waiting for his order.<br><br>“So, uh, should we get back out there and show these folks a good time.”<br><br>Chief of Staff Andy Card stood against the wall. He seemed dazed. He stared wordlessly at the open black briefcase and the documents scattered across the teacher’s desk. Keys in the ignition. A cheer echoed through the walls, as the earliest states reported their returns. <br><br>“Come on, now. Look, it’s important… It’s important that we take this as it comes. Don’t want to spook people,” George nodded, his speech growing faster as he talked. Endless sunny optimism. “Keep it going. Keep the machine going, y'know what I mean? These people came for a good time…”<br><br>“Mr. President,” said Andy.<br><br>“Deal with the problem in the morning but now we have a show…”<br><br>“George,” Card’s voice was a croak.<br><br>George let out a shrill laugh. He was beginning to grow angry now. He didn’t understand why Andy was acting like this, why he was trying to fuck him raw, after all they’d done to prove themselves to Dick, to Ted, to Poppy. There was another cheer from the auditorium. They were so close to the precipice. <br><br>He gave Andy a smile so sharp it could cut. “We can’t disappoint these people. We’ve done so much. We’ve handled the situation. Deciding. I’m the decider. They’re voting now because—.”<br><br>“Mr. President,” the uniformed man’s voice was firm but surprisingly gentle. George turned. <br><br>“You have just ordered a nuclear strike on a hostile government.” A beat. “As we speak, your order is being transmitted. It will be acted upon imminently if not already.” Another beat. “Once the Government of China’s early warning systems detect our launch, they will retaliate.” The man’s eyes were not unkind, but they bored into his own. “Do you understand?”<br><br>George stared uncomprehending, his mouth agape. He wondered if Poppy was watching the returns right now, if he was sitting in his carpeted study with its red telephones and briefing papers and miniature cathode television and knick-knacks accumulated over a lifetime of service and distinction and good judgment. He wondered if he was waiting for him to call, waiting for his son, as he sipped on brandy and watched the returns pour in.<br><br>The military aide turned to Card. “I need you to get the president’s detail. We have maybe twenty minutes to get to the airport and for Air Force One to be wheels up—with as many people aboard as possible.”<br><br>The order went through Andy like a jolt. He left the room and was screaming for agents, who were even now barreling down the hallway. George felt himself being grabbed gruffly around the jacket, feeling the stitching come loose as he half-walked, half-skidded down linoleum tiles away from an auditorium of supporters. He could see the surprised faces of reporters and volunteers watching the president be dragged through a school. He could hear the low thrum of a helicopter being started.<br><br>This was all wrong. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be happening. He needed his bagman. He needed Blake to give him his cell phone. He was supposed to be in DC with Laura and the girls and an adoring crowd at the Reagan Center that screamed like falling rockets. He needed the gleaming lights and sounds.

          <p>Something had broken. Ruptured. George was sure he was dying inside the small, makeshift green room in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC. It was the only thing that explained his inability to move, his inability to act. He sat in a chair before an illuminated vanity, doubled over as if in pain, ignoring both the muted television and the feed of the building’s increasingly dismal election night party. Talking heads mouthed silently over pictures of cheering crowds in New York and Chicago.

He remembered sitting in the back of his limousine with Rove as Rove grimaced at exit poll numbers. He remembered Laura and his girls talking in exaggerated terms about the successes he had already had, about the good he had done since coming to Washington. He’d willed himself to ignore the implications of these interactions, had told himself he’d prove them wrong.<br><br>There was an ache in his chest. He drew his body in closer.<br><br>Advisors entered and left his green room, attempting to nudge him without broaching the topic directly. What did he think about calling up his opponent, Card hinted, an hour after the full extent of the calamity became clear. Maybe he could talk with his running mate about how to talk sense to the increasingly sparse and heartbroken crowds at his party, offered Fletcher. Did he want to talk to Roger at Fox and maybe work out some plan for the next few days? Nothing moved him. All his certainty, his swagger, his confidence, had vanished. He was hollow and used up.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>Bush did not move from his near-fetal position.<br><br>“Sir, um. It’s Blake Gottesman.” There was a pause. George listened as his bag man shifted his weight uncomfortably in the doorway. “I don’t want to bother you while you, um…” He broke off. “Your father is on the phone. He demanded to talk to you.”<br><br>The ache spread, cancer-like. He wanted more than anything to vanish, but instead he unfolded his body and cast a desperate look at his assistant. “Poppy is…?”<br><br>Blake deposited a black device in George’s hand. He stared at the weight and then at Blake.<br><br>“You… need to take it off hold, Mr. President.”<br><br>George wiped his face with his sleeve and cleared his throat. Then he took the call off hold and spoke in the most normal voice he could manage. “Hi, Poppy.”<br><br>“George,” the voice on the other end of the receiver rumbled like an approaching storm. “What do you think you’re doing?”<br><br>George was silent. He stood up from his chair. Blake, sensing danger, retreated into the hallway. “I’m uh… I’m watching the returns, Poppy. Our people… They umm… they don’t think…”<br><br>He trailed off, expecting his father to interrupt, but the old man was silent. Somehow, that was worse. <br><br>“There’s still votes to count. I don’t want to do anything I’m gonna regret after 2000,” he offered weakly.<br><br>“Pathetic.” Poppy’s voice was loud and sharp. A clap of thunder. “Bullshit.” <br><br>“Poppy, please…”<br><br>“Do you think no one’s noticed you sitting there crying your eyes out? You’re in there going, ‘Boo hoo. Boo hoo. Poor me.’” George was aware he was breathing heavy and gripping the phone so hard that his knuckles had started to crack. “The results are bad enough, but do you know how humiliating your bellyaching is? For the party? For your mother? For Jeb?”<br><br>His voice was barely more than a whisper. “But in ‘92 you…”<br><br>“That was Perot. I would have killed Clinton without him. I won in a landslide in ‘88.”<br><br>George felt as if there was a fire burning under his skin. His head felt warm. He was sure at any moment, he would self-immolate. “Poppy, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” He forced himself to breathe but it was suddenly ragged. “I don’t know what—. It’s all coming apart, Poppy. It’s all coming apart.” His vision blurred. “It’s all coming apart and I don’t know what to do. They’re gonna destroy everything.”<br><br>“You were given so many chances, Junior. You were given so, so many chances. At Princeton. At Harvard. In Texas. There are people who would kill for everything you got, all the opportunities. And you fucked it. If I’d known this was how you’d turn out, I never would have let you get this far.” On the phone, Poppy was breathing hard. “Get out there and concede or you won’t like what happens next. I promise you.”<br><br>“Daddy…”<br><br>“Grow up.”<br><br>There was a loud click. The line went dead. George stood in silence looking at the phone. In his mind, he saw himself crying. He saw himself shattering the phone against the wall. He saw himself calling back and screaming into his father’s ear. Instead, he opened the phone carefully and dialed his opponent. He put on his best mask of confidence as they answered.  As he laughed and joked in his fake cowboy confidence, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

He put on his best mask of confidence as they answered.  As he laughed and joked in his fake cowboy confidence, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

          <p>Something had broken. Ruptured. George was sure he was dying inside the small, makeshift green room in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC. It was the only thing that explained his inability to move, his inability to act. He sat in a chair before an illuminated vanity, doubled over as if in pain, ignoring both the muted television and the feed of the building’s increasingly dismal election night party. Talking heads mouthed silently over pictures of cheering crowds in New York and Chicago. A map of the country displayed an ever-expanding Democratic wave penetrating into the heart of what had once been Bush country.<br><br>George wracked his brain to figure out where the night had gone wrong. He remembered meeting with Condi at the White House and her frowning when he expressed his hope that they called his victory early. He remembered sitting in the back of his limousine with Rove as Rove grimaced at exit poll numbers. He remembered Laura and his girls talking in exaggerated terms about the successes he had already had, about the good he had done since coming to Washington. He’d willed himself to ignore the implications of these interactions, had told himself he’d prove them wrong.<br><br>There was an ache in his chest. He drew his body in closer.<br><br>Advisors entered and left his green room, attempting to nudge him without broaching the topic directly. What did he think about calling up his opponent, Card hinted, an hour after the full extent of the calamity became clear. Maybe he could talk with his running mate about how to talk sense to the increasingly sparse and heartbroken crowds at his party, offered Fletcher. Did he want to talk to Roger at Fox and maybe work out some plan for the next few days? Nothing moved him. All his certainty, his swagger, his confidence, had vanished. He was hollow and used up.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>Bush did not move from his near-fetal position.<br><br>“Sir, um. It’s Blake Gottesman.” There was a pause. George listened as his bag man shifted his weight uncomfortably in the doorway. “I don’t want to bother you while you, um…” He broke off. “Your father is on the phone. He demanded to talk to you.”<br><br>The ache spread, cancer-like. He wanted more than anything to vanish, but instead he unfolded his body and cast a desperate look at his assistant. “Poppy is…?”<br><br>Blake deposited a black device in George’s hand. He stared at the weight and then at Blake.<br><br>“You… need to take it off hold, Mr. President.”<br><br>George wiped his face with his sleeve and cleared his throat. Then he took the call off hold and spoke in the most normal voice he could manage. “Hi, Poppy.”<br><br>“George,” the voice on the other end of the receiver rumbled like an approaching storm. “What do you think you’re doing?”<br><br>George was silent. He stood up from his chair. Blake, sensing danger, retreated into the hallway. “I’m uh… I’m watching the returns, Poppy. Our people… They umm… they don’t think…”<br><br>He trailed off, expecting his father to interrupt, but the old man was silent. Somehow, that was worse. <br><br>“There’s still votes to count. I don’t want to do anything I’m gonna regret after 2000,” he offered weakly.<br><br>“Pathetic.” Poppy’s voice was loud and sharp. A clap of thunder. “Bullshit.” <br><br>“Poppy, please…”<br><br>“Do you think no one’s noticed you sitting there crying your eyes out? You’re in there going, ‘Boo hoo. Boo hoo. Poor me.’” George was aware he was breathing heavy and gripping the phone so hard that his knuckles had started to crack. “The results are bad enough, but do you know how humiliating your bellyaching is? For the party? For your mother? For Jeb?”<br><br>His voice was barely more than a whisper. “But in ‘92 you…”<br><br>“That was Perot. I would have killed Clinton without him. I won in a landslide in ‘88.”<br><br>George felt as if there was a fire burning under his skin. His head felt warm. He was sure at any moment, he would self-immolate. “Poppy, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” He forced himself to breathe but it was suddenly ragged. “I don’t know what—. It’s all coming apart, Poppy. It’s all coming apart.” His vision blurred. “It’s all coming apart and I don’t know what to do. They’re gonna destroy everything.”<br><br>“You were given so many chances, Junior. You were given so, so many chances. At Princeton. At Harvard. In Texas. There are people who would kill for everything you got, all the opportunities. And you fucked it.

              <p>The mood inside the Reagan Building in downtown DC was funereal. There had been no dropped balloons, no cheers. A few people cried, but most were silent as blue descended upon the map, state by state, locality by locality. A thousand bleary eyes gazed up into the enormous projected face of Brit Hume as he informed viewers that New York had fallen, that Ohio had fallen, that Utah and Alabama had fallen. George W. Bush was on track to become the most dismal failure in America’s history. Worse than McGovern, worse than Mondale, worse than Alf Landon. He had achieved something that no one thought possible. He had won no electoral votes. He had become the worst—.<br><br>In his green room, George W. Bush muted his television and sat watching the images scroll by. There was an image of his campaign rally, the scattered attendees looking pained and miserable. There was a picture of himself, younger, sitting next to his father and Poppy. There was an ad for Non-Drowsy Claritin-D. A woman carrying a tennis racket breathed in heavily and smiled.<br><br>He snorted at the sight. Then his snort turned into a laugh. Then his laugh turned into a series of great, hearty bursts. There were tears in his eyes. They were rolling down his cheeks. The whole thing was absurd. Outrageous. Inconceivable. Not even in his worst nightmares had he imagined such a dismal failure. <br><br>He continued laughing. His career in politics was over. His future was gone. His failure was so enormous, so complete, that it was hard to imagine himself not dragging everyone down with him. Powell and Condi wouldn’t be able to enter a room without people snickering. Cheney would have trouble getting in any room except as a joke. Jeb would be a laughing stock, the man who stole an election for the least successful in American history. Every Bush, his entire family, would be obliterated from the ranks of the Republican Party. <br><br>He was laughing so hard that he was growing light-headed. He couldn’t see the room clearly. He felt high. <br><br>“Blake! Blake!” He called out. “Blake, goddamnit, get your ass in here.”<br><br>There was a creak of the door and his bag man, Blake Gottesman, stepped inside. He looked stricken, either not seeing or refusing to see his wild grin.<br><br>“Blake, give me my phone, I wanna call Poppy.”<br><br>Blake said nothing. He looked at the president with a blank expression.<br><br>George laughed, then got up from his chair. “Phone, Blake. Don’t make me go rooting around in your pockets for it.”<br><br>His bagman opened and shut his mouth fishlike. Then, without a word, he handed the president his phone, and walked out the door, mortified. George did not care. The phone was already ringing. It went to voicemail. He tried a second time and received the same result. On the third, he remained on the line and waited for the beep.<br><br>“Hey, Poppy. It’s Junior. I’m sure you’re in your study right now, watching the results. Maybe you’re even listening to this message right now. Who knows? Wherever you’re at, I just wanna let you know I’m thinking ‘bout you. I’m thinking ‘bout… you on this most historic of occasions. I’m thinking about you and Mom and Jeb and the whole thing.”<br><br>George did not know what he was saying, but it didn’t matter. The worst had already come to pass. Nothing could hurt him anymore. <br><br>“You know, I tried so hard to be just what you wanted. I went to Yale. I went into the Guard. I even did the oil thing. I did it all for you. And it never seemed to matter how hard I worked or how hard I tried. It was never good enough.” He chuckled and kicked his boot against the carpet. “I was always performin’, even as a little kid, y’know? I was always tryin’ to make people like you happy. And look where that got us?”<br><br>Something wet rolled down his cheeks. He wiped his eyes and continued grinning.<br><br>“Maybe I am a fuck-up. Maybe I am a black sheep and I don’t got the intellect of you or Jeb. I don’t care anymore. I’m tired, Poppy. I’m tired of doing all this shit to make other people happy. I love you, but if you can’t accept that I’m my own person with my own stuff, well…” He took a breath. “Well, you can go right to—.”<br><br>“Maximum voicemail length reached,” said a crisp mechanical voice in his ear. “Thank you for your call.”<br><br>There was a loud click and the line went dead. George continued to stare at the phone for several long seconds. Then, wordlessly, he slipped it into his pocket and stepped out of the dressing room. There were no aides to stop him as he took Laura by the arm. He kissed her gently on the head and, together, they walked out onto the stage to appear before the dismal crowd. He could not see their miserable faces, but maybe it was better that way. He did not try to imagine what the future held.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Beneath the Great Seal</h3>
          <p>The excitement inside the Reagan building in downtown DC had been building in the hours before the polls closed. Republicans, decked in red baseball caps and pins and small American flags had descended on the building, excited to see just how badly they beat Robert Byrd. Bush campaign volunteers passed out popcorn while a projection of Fox’s Brit Hume intoned on rock-bottom Democratic turnout and the possibility of a historic outcome. New York could flip, so too could Hawaii. This could be the final, absurd defeat of the Democrat Party and the so-called anti-war movement, he informed the gleeful crowd.<br><br>Then, as hours ticked by, the celebration found itself plunged into darkness. The blue strongholds did not fall. There were no great victories or conquests. Instead, the assembled crowd watched in horror as the blue South rose from its grave. A jagged blue line cut its way across South and Appalachia, leaving a jagged scar across Bush Country. No network had called anything by 3:00 AM because what was happening was impossible to conceive. <br><br>George stared at the television in his green room. His breath was shallow. He felt light-headed. This could not be happening. It was a trick. A lie. Fraud. He watched a dazed Hume fumble with a set of papers and clear his throat. According to Fox’s projections, Robert Byrd, octogenarian, was on path to defeat—.<br><br>Bush turned off the television with his remote and then flung it across the room. It cracked open and batteries spilled out across the floor. He needed Rove. He needed Rove to get in here to explain how they could get over this. People had told him it was impossible to win in 2000 and then Rove had helped Jeb—.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George was aware that his hands were around his own neck. He let his arms drop and turned slowly to face, not Rove, but his bagman Blake Gottesman. The boy, gangly with spots of acne, shifted his weight from side to side, like an untrained sailor attempting to keep his balance. George stared at him without comprehension.<br><br>“I uh… hope I’m not interrupting anything, Mr. President,” Blake looked at him and George stared back wordlessly. “It’s your father. You uh… told me to—.  I can tell him to call back later if you’d—?”<br><br>George shook his head and in a small voice said. “No. No. I’ll… talk to him. Give it here, Blake.”<br><br>As if in a dream, George felt a small cell phone press itself into his hand. He watched his concerned bagman walk out the room backwards, a concerned look on his face. He stared at the device for a fraction of a second and then, with shaking hands, drew it to his ear. There was a small click as he took it off hold.<br><br>“Poppy,” said George.<br><br>The silence on the other end of the phone was long and unbroken. Then, when it at last had become unbearable, he heard his father’s familiar voice. “I’ll be surprised if you can show your face anywhere after this.”<br><br>It was as if he’d been punched in the belly. “I don’t—.”<br><br>“An octogenarian. A relic. Robert Byrd. Christ.” There was the sound of rustling papers, as if  Poppy were digging for something in his office. “If he were younger, I’d understand, I suppose. The anti-war stuff has its appeal. The race stuff too, even if he says he’s ‘reformed.’” <br><br>George shook his head. He couldn’t speak. He felt on the verge of tears.<br><br>“But Robert Byrd. Robert Byrd. How you managed to lose to Robert Byrd…” A pause. “What a disgusting embarrassment. Unbelievable.” <br><br>George’s body shook as his body involuntarily bent at the waist. He leaned himself against the wall and struggled to breathe. “Poppy.”<br><br>“Childish. Stupid. A travesty. I didn’t think there was any low you could sink to that could surprise me any more, but I was wrong.” <br><br>“Please.”<br><br>“At least Clinton was a respectable candidate. But this... ” Poppy’s voice was deep and dark. Every word tore a new wound. “Do you understand how humiliating this all is for the party? For your mother? For Jeb? We gave you every opportunity and you not only wasted it, but you made us into laughing stocks. So, go ahead, finish crying in your room by yourself and then concede. It’s the least you can do.”<br><br>George took in a deep, quivering breath. “Daddy.”<br><br>“Grow up.”<br><br>There was a click as the line went dead. George made an awful noise and let the phone drop to the floor. He knew what he needed to do, but he could not make his body move. The room shimmered and then blurred as something wet fell from his cheeks. He did not know what the future held, but he did not see a place for himself in it.</p>`)

Did he want to talk to Roger at Fox and maybe work out some plan for the next few days? Nothing moved him. All his certainty, his swagger, his confidence, had vanished. He was hollow and used up.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>Bush did not move from his near-fetal position.<br><br>“Sir, um. It’s Blake Gottesman.” There was a pause. George listened as his bag man shifted his weight uncomfortably in the doorway. “I don’t want to bother you while you, um…” He broke off. “Your father is on the phone. He demanded to talk to you.”<br><br>The ache spread, cancer-like. He wanted more than anything to vanish, but instead he unfolded his body and cast a desperate look at his assistant. “Poppy is…?”<br><br>Blake deposited a black device in George’s hand. He stared at the weight and then at Blake.<br><br>“You… need to take it off hold, Mr. President.”<br><br>George wiped his face with his sleeve and cleared his throat. Then he took the call off hold and spoke in the most normal voice he could manage. “Hi, Poppy.”<br><br>“George,” the voice on the other end of the receiver rumbled like an approaching storm. “What do you think you’re doing?”<br><br>George was silent. He stood up from his chair. Blake, sensing danger, retreated into the hallway. “I’m uh… I’m watching the returns, Poppy. Our people… They umm… they don’t think…”<br><br>He trailed off, expecting his father to interrupt, but the old man was silent. Somehow, that was worse. <br><br>“There’s still votes to count. I don’t want to do anything I’m gonna regret after 2000,” he offered weakly.<br><br>“Pathetic.” Poppy’s voice was loud and sharp. A clap of thunder. “Bullshit.” <br><br>“Poppy, please…”<br><br>“Do you think no one’s noticed you sitting there crying your eyes out? You’re in there going, ‘Boo hoo. Boo hoo. Poor me.’” George was aware he was breathing heavy and gripping the phone so hard that his knuckles had started to crack. “The results are bad enough, but do you know how humiliating your bellyaching is? For the party? For your mother? For Jeb?”<br><br>His voice was barely more than a whisper. “But in ‘92 you…”<br><br>“That was Perot. I would have killed Clinton without him. I won in a landslide in ‘88.”<br><br>George felt as if there was a fire burning under his skin. His head felt warm. He was sure at any moment, he would self-immolate. “Poppy, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” He forced himself to breathe but it was suddenly ragged. “I don’t know what—. It’s all coming apart, Poppy.

He saw himself shattering the phone against the wall. He saw himself calling back and screaming into his father’s ear. Instead, he opened the phone carefully and dialed his opponent.

          <p>George had started the night off in high spirits. His election night party in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC had attracted a large, enthusiastic crowd. Rove had told him that the exit polls in key battleground states seemed to be tilted in their favor. Anderson Cooper, one of his least favorite television personalities, had looked unusually unkempt standing outside a rain-soaked polling station in Michigan. All of these seemed to be good signs.<br><br>He had been in such a good mood from these developments that he had missed the first signs of distress, of the sea liner hitting the iceberg. There was not an immediate call for his victory, as Card had predicted, and every news update seemed to remove victory further from his grasp. Swing states tilted right, then left, then further left still. Votes from cities washed away at their margins elsewhere. He caught Rove nervously cleaning his fingernails with his teeth the one time he emerged from his makeshift green room. He shot the man a thumbs up before grabbing a slice of pizza and scampering back to his makeshift green room to hide. He needed to keep his spirits up. He needed to keep smiling.<br><br>He was still forcing himself to smile by 2:00 AM. While Fox still held out, CNN and MSNBC had called it: George W. Bush had lost the presidency. There were no words coming out of the muted television in his green room, but he could read their lips just fine. “LOSER. LOSER. LOSER.” Even the crowds at his own party seemed to be sarcastic with their chanting, which reverberated through the building. “DON’T BACK DOWN. DON’T BACK DOWN. BACK—.” <br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George forced himself to turn, to look at the intruder with a warm smile instead of bashing in his face with his fist. He gave a light chuckle, “Oh, Blake, how ya holding up?”<br><br>Blake Gottesman, his bag man, gave a nervous grimace. “Um, fine, sir. I uh…” He shifted from foot to foot like an overlarge child. Behind his grin, George watched the scene. He wondered what he had ever seen in the child. “Your father called. President B—. I mean—. Uh.”<br><br>Blake extended a small, black cellphone from his pocket. George’s smile widened because if he did anything else, he was sure he would scream or break down crying. How had this happened? How had it come to this? In the corner of his eye, he could see the talking heads continue their crusade against him. The whole world was determined to tear him down and now Poppy… <br><br>The thought of his father caused all the anger in him to melt into something far more awful and pathetic.<br><br>“Well, heck, thanks. I suppose I oughta see what’s got his goat.”<br><br>He took the phone from Blake as the boy retreated to the hall. He stared for a moment at the black device and then, before he could think twice, took it off hold.<br><br>“Looks like your luck finally ran out, Junior,” came the crackle of a voice through the receiver.<br><br>George’s voice was not his campaign-trained, cowboy twang but something childish. Cloying. “It wasn’t luck, Poppy. I worked hard.”<br><br>“Mhm. Sure.”<br><br>“And we don’t know it’s over yet. There’s still votes to be counted in—.”<br><br>“No, George, there’s not. Jeb can’t bail you out of this one,” There was a long pause. George thought he could hear the clinking of a glass being set on a table followed by a sigh. “What a goddamn mess. What a waste.”<br><br>George said nothing. <br><br>“A generation of political capital squandered on idiot ambitions. If you had listened to me at any point in the last four years, we wouldn’t be here now. I should have known after Cheney weaseled his way onto the ticket, after the shitshow you pulled with North Korea…”<br><br>George stared intensely at his feet. He could actually feel himself sinking, could see the fragments of his presidency floating on the waves and turning into junk.<br><br>“Your brother never would have gotten himself here.”<br><br>“Poppy, I—.” There was so much he wanted to say, but instead he heard himself mutter, “I know.”<br><br>“Well, at least you’re finally being honest with yourself. Christ.” Another pause. Another clink of the glass. “I guess we have work to do. I’m sure Rove’s people will have you doing all kinds of tricks tonight to keep the people at your election party from rioting, but Jeb and I will call tomorrow to figure out next steps. Just don’t screw up anything else before we can talk again, okay?”<br><br>Bush nodded and then, aware that it wouldn’t carry, spoke into the phone. “Okay, Poppy. I should probably go now.” He rubbed his face. “I love you. Make sure to tell mother I said the same to her.”<br><br>Through the static, there was a grunt. “Okay, George. Night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s, and pecked her on the cheek—a gesture he had once seen his father do. Then, without any further hesitation, George stepped out onto the stage before the disappointed crowd. Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.<p>`)

How had it come to this? In the corner of his eye, he could see the talking heads continue their crusade against him. The whole world was determined to tear him down and now Poppy… <br><br>The thought of his father caused all the anger in him to melt into something far more awful and pathetic.<br><br>“Well, heck, thanks. I suppose I oughta see what’s got his goat.”<br><br>He took the phone from Blake as the boy retreated to the hall. He stared for a moment at the black device and then, before he could think twice, took it off hold.<br><br>“Looks like your luck finally ran out, Junior,” came the crackle of a voice through the receiver.<br><br>George’s voice was not his campaign-trained, cowboy twang but something childish. Cloying. “It wasn’t luck, Poppy. I worked hard.”<br><br>“Mhm. Sure.”<br><br>“And we don’t know it’s over yet. There’s still votes to be counted in—.”<br><br>“No, George, there’s not. Jeb can’t bail you out of this one,” There was a long pause. George thought he could hear the clinking of a glass being set on a table followed by a sigh. “What a goddamn mess. What a waste.”<br><br>George said nothing. <br><br>“A generation of political capital squandered on idiot ambitions. If you had listened to me at any point in the last four years, we wouldn’t be here now. I should have known after Cheney weaseled his way onto the ticket, after the shitshow you pulled with North Korea…”<br><br>George stared intensely at his feet. He could actually feel himself sinking, could see the fragments of his presidency floating on the waves and turning into junk.<br><br>“Your brother never would have gotten himself here.”<br><br>“Poppy, I—.” There was so much he wanted to say, but instead he heard himself mutter, “I know.”<br><br>“Well, at least you’re finally being honest with yourself. Christ.” Another pause. Another clink of the glass. “I guess we have work to do. I’m sure Rove’s people will have you doing all kinds of tricks tonight to keep the people at your election party from rioting, but Jeb and I will call tomorrow to figure out next steps. Just don’t screw up anything else before we can talk again, okay?”<br><br>Bush nodded and then, aware that it wouldn’t carry, spoke into the phone. “Okay, Poppy. I should probably go now.” He rubbed his face. “I love you. Make sure to tell mother I said the same to her.”<br><br>Through the static, there was a grunt. “Okay, George. Night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s, and pecked her on the cheek—a gesture he had once seen his father do. Then, without any further hesitation, George stepped out onto the stage before the disappointed crowd. Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

          <p>George had started the night off in high spirits. His election night party in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC had attracted a large, enthusiastic crowd. Rove had told him that the exit polls in key battleground states seemed to be tilted in their favor.

There was not an immediate call for his victory, as Card had predicted, and every news update seemed to remove victory further from his grasp.

He caught Rove nervously cleaning his fingernails with his teeth the one time he emerged from his makeshift green room. He shot the man a thumbs up before grabbing a slice of pizza and scampering back to his makeshift green room to hide. He needed to keep his spirits up. He needed to keep smiling.<br><br>He was still forcing himself to smile by 2:00 AM. While Fox still held out, CNN and MSNBC had called it: George W. Bush had lost the presidency. There were no words coming out of the muted television in his green room, but he could read their lips just fine. “LOSER. LOSER. LOSER.” Even the crowds at his own party seemed to be sarcastic with their chanting, which reverberated through the building. “DON’T BACK DOWN. DON’T BACK DOWN. BACK—.” <br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George forced himself to turn, to look at the intruder with a warm smile instead of bashing in his face with his fist. He gave a light chuckle, “Oh, Blake, how ya holding up?”<br><br>Blake Gottesman, his bag man, gave a nervous grimace. “Um, fine, sir. I uh…” He shifted from foot to foot like an overlarge child.

He shot the man a thumbs up before grabbing a slice of pizza and scampering back to his makeshift green room to hide. He needed to keep his spirits up. He needed to keep smiling.<br><br>He was still forcing himself to smile by 2:00 AM. While Fox still held out, CNN and MSNBC had called it: George W. Bush had lost the presidency. There were no words coming out of the muted television in his green room, but he could read their lips just fine. “LOSER. LOSER. LOSER.” Even the crowds at his own party seemed to be sarcastic with their chanting, which reverberated through the building. “DON’T BACK DOWN. DON’T BACK DOWN. BACK—.” <br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George forced himself to turn, to look at the intruder with a warm smile instead of bashing in his face with his fist. He gave a light chuckle, “Oh, Blake, how ya holding up?”<br><br>Blake Gottesman, his bag man, gave a nervous grimace. “Um, fine, sir. I uh…” He shifted from foot to foot like an overlarge child. Behind his grin, George watched the scene. He wondered what he had ever seen in the child. “Your father called. President B—. I mean—. Uh.”<br><br>Blake extended a small, black cellphone from his pocket. George’s smile widened because if he did anything else, he was sure he would scream or break down crying. How had this happened? How had it come to this? In the corner of his eye, he could see the talking heads continue their crusade against him. The whole world was determined to tear him down and now Poppy… <br><br>The thought of his father caused all the anger in him to melt into something far more awful and pathetic.<br><br>“Well, heck, thanks. I suppose I oughta see what’s got his goat.”<br><br>He took the phone from Blake as the boy retreated to the hall. He stared for a moment at the black device and then, before he could think twice, took it off hold.<br><br>“Looks like your luck finally ran out, Junior,” came the crackle of a voice through the receiver.<br><br>George’s voice was not his campaign-trained, cowboy twang but something childish. Cloying. “It wasn’t luck, Poppy. I worked hard.”<br><br>“Mhm. Sure.”<br><br>“And we don’t know it’s over yet. There’s still votes to be counted in—.”<br><br>“No, George, there’s not. Jeb can’t bail you out of this one,” There was a long pause. George thought he could hear the clinking of a glass being set on a table followed by a sigh. “What a goddamn mess. What a waste.”<br><br>George said nothing. <br><br>“A generation of political capital squandered on idiot ambitions. If you had listened to me at any point in the last four years, we wouldn’t be here now. I should have known after Cheney weaseled his way onto the ticket, after the shitshow you pulled with North Korea…”<br><br>George stared intensely at his feet. He could actually feel himself sinking, could see the fragments of his presidency floating on the waves and turning into junk.<br><br>“Your brother never would have gotten himself here.”<br><br>“Poppy, I—.” There was so much he wanted to say, but instead he heard himself mutter, “I know.”<br><br>“Well, at least you’re finally being honest with yourself. Christ.” Another pause. Another clink of the glass. “I guess we have work to do. I’m sure Rove’s people will have you doing all kinds of tricks tonight to keep the people at your election party from rioting, but Jeb and I will call tomorrow to figure out next steps. Just don’t screw up anything else before we can talk again, okay?”<br><br>Bush nodded and then, aware that it wouldn’t carry, spoke into the phone. “Okay, Poppy. I should probably go now.” He rubbed his face. “I love you. Make sure to tell mother I said the same to her.”<br><br>Through the static, there was a grunt. “Okay, George. Night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s, and pecked her on the cheek—a gesture he had once seen his father do. Then, without any further hesitation, George stepped out onto the stage before the disappointed crowd. Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Beneath the Great Seal</h3>
          <p>The excitement inside the Reagan building in downtown DC had been building in the hours before the polls closed. Republicans, decked in red baseball caps and pins and small American flags had descended on the building, excited to see just how badly they beat Robert Byrd. Bush campaign volunteers passed out popcorn while a projection of Fox’s Brit Hume intoned on rock-bottom Democratic turnout and the possibility of a historic outcome. New York could flip, so too could Hawaii. This could be the final, absurd defeat of the Democrat Party and the so-called anti-war movement, he informed the gleeful crowd.<br><br>Then, as hours ticked by, the celebration found itself plunged into darkness. The blue strongholds did not fall. There were no great victories or conquests. Instead, the assembled crowd watched in horror as the blue South rose from its grave. A jagged blue line cut its way across South and Appalachia, leaving a jagged scar across Bush Country. No network had called anything by 3:00 AM because what was happening was impossible to conceive. <br><br>George stared at the television in his green room. His breath was shallow. He felt light-headed. This could not be happening. It was a trick. A lie. Fraud. He watched a dazed Hume fumble with a set of papers and clear his throat. According to Fox’s projections, Robert Byrd, octogenarian, was on path to defeat—.<br><br>Bush turned off the television with his remote and then flung it across the room. It cracked open and batteries spilled out across the floor. He needed Rove. He needed Rove to get in here to explain how they could get over this. People had told him it was impossible to win in 2000 and then Rove had helped Jeb—.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George was aware that his hands were around his own neck. He let his arms drop and turned slowly to face, not Rove, but his bagman Blake Gottesman. The boy, gangly with spots of acne, shifted his weight from side to side, like an untrained sailor attempting to keep his balance. George stared at him without comprehension.<br><br>“I uh… hope I’m not interrupting anything, Mr. President,” Blake looked at him and George stared back wordlessly. “It’s your father. You uh… told me to—.  I can tell him to call back later if you’d—?”<br><br>George shook his head and in a small voice said. “No. No. I’ll… talk to him. Give it here, Blake.”<br><br>As if in a dream, George felt a small cell phone press itself into his hand. He watched his concerned bagman walk out the room backwards, a concerned look on his face. He stared at the device for a fraction of a second and then, with shaking hands, drew it to his ear. There was a small click as he took it off hold.<br><br>“Poppy,” said George.<br><br>The silence on the other end of the phone was long and unbroken. Then, when it at last had become unbearable, he heard his father’s familiar voice. “I’ll be surprised if you can show your face anywhere after this.”<br><br>It was as if he’d been punched in the belly. “I don’t—.”<br><br>“An octogenarian. A relic. Robert Byrd. Christ.” There was the sound of rustling papers, as if  Poppy were digging for something in his office. “If he were younger, I’d understand, I suppose. The anti-war stuff has its appeal. The race stuff too, even if he says he’s ‘reformed.’” <br><br>George shook his head. He couldn’t speak. He felt on the verge of tears.<br><br>“But Robert Byrd. Robert Byrd. How you managed to lose to Robert Byrd…” A pause. “What a disgusting embarrassment. Unbelievable.” <br><br>George’s body shook as his body involuntarily bent at the waist. He leaned himself against the wall and struggled to breathe. “Poppy.”<br><br>“Childish. Stupid. A travesty. I didn’t think there was any low you could sink to that could surprise me any more, but I was wrong.” <br><br>“Please.”<br><br>“At least Clinton was a respectable candidate. But this... ” Poppy’s voice was deep and dark. Every word tore a new wound. “Do you understand how humiliating this all is for the party? For your mother? For Jeb? We gave you every opportunity and you not only wasted it, but you made us into laughing stocks. So, go ahead, finish crying in your room by yourself and then concede. It’s the least you can do.”<br><br>George took in a deep, quivering breath. “Daddy.”<br><br>“Grow up.”<br><br>There was a click as the line went dead. George made an awful noise and let the phone drop to the floor. He knew what he needed to do, but he could not make his body move. The room shimmered and then blurred as something wet fell from his cheeks. He did not know what the future held, but he did not see a place for himself in it.</p>`)

          <p>George had started the night off in high spirits. His election night party in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC had attracted a large, enthusiastic crowd. Rove had told him that the exit polls in key battleground states seemed to be tilted in their favor. Anderson Cooper, one of his least favorite television personalities, had looked unusually unkempt standing outside a rain-soaked polling station in Michigan. All of these seemed to be good signs.<br><br>He had been in such a good mood from these developments that he had missed the first signs of distress, of the sea liner hitting the iceberg. There was not an immediate call for his victory, as Card had predicted, and every news update seemed to remove victory further from his grasp. Swing states tilted right, then left, then further left still. Votes from cities washed away at their margins elsewhere. He caught Rove nervously cleaning his fingernails with his teeth the one time he emerged from his makeshift green room. He shot the man a thumbs up before grabbing a slice of pizza and scampering back to his makeshift green room to hide. He needed to keep his spirits up. He needed to keep smiling.<br><br>He was still forcing himself to smile by 2:00 AM. While Fox still held out, CNN and MSNBC had called it: George W. Bush had lost the presidency. There were no words coming out of the muted television in his green room, but he could read their lips just fine. “LOSER. LOSER. LOSER.” Even the crowds at his own party seemed to be sarcastic with their chanting, which reverberated through the building. “DON’T BACK DOWN. DON’T BACK DOWN. BACK—.” <br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George forced himself to turn, to look at the intruder with a warm smile instead of bashing in his face with his fist. He gave a light chuckle, “Oh, Blake, how ya holding up?”<br><br>Blake Gottesman, his bag man, gave a nervous grimace. “Um, fine, sir. I uh…” He shifted from foot to foot like an overlarge child. Behind his grin, George watched the scene. He wondered what he had ever seen in the child. “Your father called. President B—. I mean—. Uh.”<br><br>Blake extended a small, black cellphone from his pocket. George’s smile widened because if he did anything else, he was sure he would scream or break down crying. How had this happened? How had it come to this? In the corner of his eye, he could see the talking heads continue their crusade against him. The whole world was determined to tear him down and now Poppy… <br><br>The thought of his father caused all the anger in him to melt into something far more awful and pathetic.<br><br>“Well, heck, thanks. I suppose I oughta see what’s got his goat.”<br><br>He took the phone from Blake as the boy retreated to the hall. He stared for a moment at the black device and then, before he could think twice, took it off hold.<br><br>“Looks like your luck finally ran out, Junior,” came the crackle of a voice through the receiver.<br><br>George’s voice was not his campaign-trained, cowboy twang but something childish. Cloying. “It wasn’t luck, Poppy. I worked hard.”<br><br>“Mhm. Sure.”<br><br>“And we don’t know it’s over yet. There’s still votes to be counted in—.”<br><br>“No, George, there’s not. Jeb can’t bail you out of this one,” There was a long pause. George thought he could hear the clinking of a glass being set on a table followed by a sigh. “What a goddamn mess. What a waste.”<br><br>George said nothing. <br><br>“A generation of political capital squandered on idiot ambitions. If you had listened to me at any point in the last four years, we wouldn’t be here now. I should have known after Cheney weaseled his way onto the ticket, after the shitshow you pulled with North Korea…”<br><br>George stared intensely at his feet. He could actually feel himself sinking, could see the fragments of his presidency floating on the waves and turning into junk.<br><br>“Your brother never would have gotten himself here.”<br><br>“Poppy, I—.” There was so much he wanted to say, but instead he heard himself mutter, “I know.”<br><br>“Well, at least you’re finally being honest with yourself. Christ.” Another pause. Another clink of the glass. “I guess we have work to do. I’m sure Rove’s people will have you doing all kinds of tricks tonight to keep the people at your election party from rioting, but Jeb and I will call tomorrow to figure out next steps. Just don’t screw up anything else before we can talk again, okay?”<br><br>Bush nodded and then, aware that it wouldn’t carry, spoke into the phone. “Okay, Poppy. I should probably go now.” He rubbed his face. “I love you. Make sure to tell mother I said the same to her.”<br><br>Through the static, there was a grunt. “Okay, George. Night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s, and pecked her on the cheek—a gesture he had once seen his father do. Then, without any further hesitation, George stepped out onto the stage before the disappointed crowd. Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

          <p>A calamity had taken place. A catastrophe. A car crash in slow motion. <br><br>It hadn’t started like this. Early in the night, the obvious states had come in. Alabama and New York had slotted into their obvious columns. The crowds at the George W. Bush Election Night Party inside the Reagan Building had watched as Republican and Democratic electoral votes grew higher and higher. They were there as the nation tiptoed to a precipice and then, at some point past 2:00 AM, flung itself off it. Though CNN, FOX, and MSNBC had refused to call it, the old fogeys at CBS had taken a bold step into the unknown—the election was tied 269-269. For the first time since 1800, the House of Representatives would pick the president.<br><br>The enormity of the event had not yet reached those gathered in the Reagan Building. Decked in their “W” hats and American flag-patterned outfits, they looked confused more than anything. George W. Bush could see them murmuring through a tiny monitor in his makeshift green room. They were growing anxious as word spread that his opponent was planning to address their own supporters within the next few minutes. His own silence was becoming noticeable, concerning, but he could not move himself to act. For the first time in a long time, he felt sapped of his certainty.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George jumped at the sudden intrusion. He spun to see, not Rove, not his running mate, but Blake Gottesman—his bag man. The boy, gangly with spots of acne, shifted his weight from side to side like a child trying to hold in his bladder.<br><br>“Sorry for bothering, Mr. President, but um…” George became aware of a phone in the boy’s hand. His mind jumped between a dozen possibilities. “It’s your father. You told me to tell you if he called tonight?”<br><br>George blinked. Then, as if in a dream, he beckoned for the boy to approach and took the phone from him with a shaky hand. Blake took a step backward and then vanished from the green room as George took the call off hold.<br><br>“Hi Poppy,” said George. His voice seemed distant.<br><br>From thousands of miles away came the voice of George’s father, harsh and clipped. “I’ve been on the phone with Jeb. He’s been talking with his people and he thinks that ABC is right. This thing’s going for a tie or, at the very least, an extended recount.” There was a rumble that George recognized as a sigh. “This is worse than 2000. What a goddamn mess.”<br><br>“We don’t know that yet,” murmured George. His voice seemed strangely child-like, sullen. He had a brief flash of being back in elementary school, trying to explain his report card. “There’s still absentee ballots. There’s still military ballots, you know what I’m saying? There could be fraud. K-Karl says—.”<br><br>“Jesus Christ, listen to yourself. ‘Voter fraud.’” The voice was high-pitched, mocking. “Give me a break.”<br><br>“O-okay. Maybe there’s not fraud. Maybe… I mean, we don’t gotta resignate—. I mean, I we don’t have to resign ourselves to this. There’s gonna be a run-off. We could still win in the House. That’s what happens next, right? We can still come out on top.”<br><br>He was so desperate. If Poppy could just say one positive thing, if he could give him one reassurance, everything would be okay. <br><br>Instead, there was a long and deafening silence on the other end of the receiver. “No, George. The Democrats are probably going to win the House.” He let the sentence sit there, moldering. “They’ll get sworn in and then, on January 6th, they’ll vote down the line for the Democrat. You will lose. You will be evicted from the White House. There is no reprieve coming. Christ is not going to descend from the heavens to save you. Do you understand what I’m saying?”<br><br>He was quiet. He remembered how he’d come home to Poppy drunk one night when he was in his 30s. He remembered the disgusted look on his father’s face.<br><br>“Answer me when I talk to you. Do you understand?”<br><br>George swallowed. “Yeah… Poppy. I understand.”<br><br>“Good. Jeb and I will call you tomorrow about how we can play this, but what’s important right now is you get out there. You tell the people at the Reagan Center that these results are not what you wanted but you are following them closely and you will respect the will of the voters, whatever that may be. Do you understand?”<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>“Okay. Well, if you ever listened to me, you would have done this hours ago.” Poppy gave a huff. "Just get out there before things get any worse. Don’t forget, we’ll talk tomorrow.”<br><br>And then, without ceremony, Poppy hung up. Bush allowed himself to listen to the silence for several moments. Then, he reconstructed his smile. He pretended to be jovial as he walked through rows of sullen aides. He wrapped his arm around Laura and kissed her gently on the cheek, a gesture he’d seen his father do many times before. Then, he stepped out onto the stage before the crowd. He could hear their voices but, with the stage lights blaring, he could not see their faces.</p>`)

          <p>A calamity had taken place. A catastrophe. A car crash in slow motion. <br><br>It hadn’t started like this. Early in the night, the obvious states had come in. Alabama and New York had slotted into their obvious columns. The crowds at the George W. Bush Election Night Party inside the Reagan Building had watched as Republican and Democratic electoral votes grew higher and higher. They were there as the nation tiptoed to a precipice and then, at some point past 2:00 AM, flung itself off it. Though CNN, FOX, and MSNBC had refused to call it, the old fogeys at CBS had taken a bold step into the unknown—the election was tied 269-269. For the first time since 1800, the House of Representatives would pick the president.<br><br>The enormity of the event had not yet reached those gathered in the Reagan Building. Decked in their “W” hats and American flag-patterned outfits, they looked confused more than anything. George W. Bush could see them murmuring through a tiny monitor in his makeshift green room. They were growing anxious as word spread that his opponent was planning to address their own supporters within the next few minutes. His own silence was becoming noticeable, concerning, but he could not move himself to act. For the first time in a long time, he felt sapped of his certainty.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George jumped at the sudden intrusion. He spun to see, not Rove, not his running mate, but Blake Gottesman—his bag man. The boy, gangly with spots of acne, shifted his weight from side to side like a child trying to hold in his bladder.<br><br>“Sorry for bothering, Mr. President, but um…” George became aware of a phone in the boy’s hand. His mind jumped between a dozen possibilities. “It’s your father. You told me to tell you if he called tonight?”<br><br>George blinked. Then, as if in a dream, he beckoned for the boy to approach and took the phone from him with a shaky hand. Blake took a step backward and then vanished from the green room as George took the call off hold.<br><br>“Hi Poppy,” said George. His voice seemed distant.<br><br>From thousands of miles away came the voice of George’s father, harsh and clipped. “I’ve been on the phone with Jeb. He’s been talking with his people and he thinks that ABC is right. This thing’s going for a tie or, at the very least, an extended recount.” There was a rumble that George recognized as a sigh. “This is worse than 2000. What a goddamn mess.”<br><br>“We don’t know that yet,” murmured George. His voice seemed strangely child-like, sullen. He had a brief flash of being back in elementary school, trying to explain his report card. “There’s still absentee ballots. There’s still military ballots, you know what I’m saying? There could be fraud. K-Karl says—.”<br><br>“Jesus Christ, listen to yourself. ‘Voter fraud.’” The voice was high-pitched, mocking. “Give me a break.”<br><br>“O-okay. Maybe there’s not fraud. Maybe… I mean, we don’t gotta resignate—. I mean, I we don’t have to resign ourselves to this. There’s gonna be a run-off. We could still win in the House. That’s what happens next, right? We can still come out on top.”<br><br>He was so desperate. If Poppy could just say one positive thing, if he could give him one reassurance, everything would be okay. <br><br>Instead, there was a long and deafening silence on the other end of the receiver. “No, George. The Democrats are probably going to win the House.” He let the sentence sit there, moldering. “They’ll get sworn in and then, on January 6th, they’ll vote down the line for the Democrat. You will lose. You will be evicted from the White House. There is no reprieve coming. Christ is not going to descend from the heavens to save you. Do you understand what I’m saying?”<br><br>He was quiet. He remembered how he’d come home to Poppy drunk one night when he was in his 30s. He remembered the disgusted look on his father’s face.<br><br>“Answer me when I talk to you. Do you understand?”<br><br>George swallowed. “Yeah… Poppy. I understand.”<br><br>“Good. Jeb and I will call you tomorrow about how we can play this, but what’s important right now is you get out there. You tell the people at the Reagan Center that these results are not what you wanted but you are following them closely and you will respect the will of the voters, whatever that may be. Do you understand?”<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>“Okay. Well, if you ever listened to me, you would have done this hours ago.” Poppy gave a huff. "Just get out there before things get any worse. Don’t forget, we’ll talk tomorrow.”<br><br>And then, without ceremony, Poppy hung up. Bush allowed himself to listen to the silence for several moments. Then, he reconstructed his smile. He pretended to be jovial as he walked through rows of sullen aides. He wrapped his arm around Laura and kissed her gently on the cheek, a gesture he’d seen his father do many times before. Then, he stepped out onto the stage before the crowd. He could hear their voices but, with the stage lights blaring, he could not see their faces.</p>`)

          <p>Something had gone wrong in the world. There had been a mistake, an error. Someone had decided to pull some awful trick to hurt and humiliate him. It was the only explanation. <br><br>These were the only thoughts that George had as he stared, uncomprehending at the television in his green room at the Reagan building. What was meant to be a victory party to celebrate his stunning re-election against the Democrat Party and the rube Ventura had turned. Staring at splotches of purple dot the map, he felt his heart lurch as though he’d taken a step into the dark and discovered no ground beneath him. Rove had assured him that this was impossible. He had told him that the odds of a deadlock was one in one hundred, one in one thousand. On Fox, the anchors spoke with bewildered tones. They kept flashing video of his campaign rally and the devastated faces within them. <br><br>He couldn’t handle their disappointment. He couldn’t handle their shame. He buried his head in his hands at the thought of the laughing stock this would make him. He’d go out there and they’d stare at him with shock and disgust and—.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George looked up. Standing in the door of his green room stood, not Rove, not his running mate, but Blakes Gottesman—his bag man. The boy, gangly with spots of acne across his weight, shifted nervously. He looked to George like a small toddler trying to inform his parent he needed to use the bathroom.<br><br>“Yeah, Blake?”<br><br>“Sorry for bothering, Mr. President, but um…” George became aware of a phone in the boy’s hand. His mind jumped between a dozen possibilities. “It’s your father. You told me to tell you if he called tonight?”<br><br>George stared at the boy, then at the phone. As if in a dream, he felt the device press itself into his hand. Blake retreated back into the corridor. There was a small click when he took the call off hold.<br><br>“Hi, Poppy,” said George. His voice seemed distant.<br><br>From thousands of miles away came the voice of George’s father. “Well, look at the mess you’ve gotten yourself into now, George. Christ.” There was a long pause. George imagined his father in his study, sipping bourbon and shaking his head at the television. “All that effort, all that money wasted on a thing like this. You know there hasn’t been a contingent since 1800? It’s gonna be an absolute shitshow.”<br><br>“We don’t know that yet, Poppy. There’s… there’s still ballots to count. There could be voter fraud. We could flip a few of these states and get over the—.”<br><br>“Oh don’t give me that horseshit. Voter fraud.” The voice was thin and mocking. “You know, when I didn’t get the nomination in 80, I at least knew how to take the punch. And I managed to get a partial victory out of the thing. I got Reagan to make me Vice President. Eight years. If you had any sense, you’d do the same.”<br><br>George was quiet. He studied his boots. “I’m not sure I get what you’re saying.”<br><br>“Of course you don’t.” A sigh. George redoubled his focus on his shoes, anything to avoid focusing directly  on the voice in his ear. “Look, Gephardt’s a good egg. We know this. He’s our kind of people, not a radical. Hell, there were some days where I felt like I was seeing double with the two of you. Heh.”<br><br>George continued to focus on his shoes, allowing Poppy’s blows to hit him without comment. Of course Gephardt’s intellect had made him attractive to the average voter. Of course his support of tax cuts and the war had made him appealing to moderate voters. Gephardt had eaten into his support and what little he’d surrendered in the process had rallied, uselessly, against a decrepit ex-wrestler, the only person as big of a loser as he was. <br><br>Poppy continued to prattle on. “Make a deal. It’ll give us a, uh, a back channel to the White House, a seat at the table when it comes to policy making. You can’t win anyways, the opposition’s too much and all struggling will do is muck up the gears of government. You gotta come out tonight and make it clear you’re not gonna obstruct...”<br><br>“Okay, Poppy.” George said pitifully.<br><br>“Rove can probably help us play this as a noble sacrifice. For the good of the country, you know.” He paused. “Maybe it’s better this way, you dying a martyr instead of whatever… nonsense you might have gotten up to in a second term. They build presidential libraries around that kind of thing.”<br><br>George did not respond.<br><br>Poppy took a sharp intake of breath. “Okay, well, I’ll let you get to it. We can talk more tomorrow about messaging going into the contingent once things die down. Just try not to sound too miserable, okay?”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s and the pair strode onto the stage.  Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.</p>`)

          <p>Something had gone wrong in the world. There had been a mistake, an error. Someone had decided to pull some awful trick to hurt and humiliate him. It was the only explanation. <br><br>These were the only thoughts that George had as he stared, uncomprehending at the television in his green room at the Reagan building. What was meant to be a victory party to celebrate his stunning re-election against the Democrat Party and the rube Ventura had turned. Staring at splotches of purple dot the map, he felt his heart lurch as though he’d taken a step into the dark and discovered no ground beneath him. Rove had assured him that this was impossible. He had told him that the odds of a deadlock was one in one hundred, one in one thousand. On Fox, the anchors spoke with bewildered tones. They kept flashing video of his campaign rally and the devastated faces within them. <br><br>He couldn’t handle their disappointment. He couldn’t handle their shame. He buried his head in his hands at the thought of the laughing stock this would make him. He’d go out there and they’d stare at him with shock and disgust and—.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George looked up. Standing in the door of his green room stood, not Rove, not his running mate, but Blakes Gottesman—his bag man. The boy, gangly with spots of acne across his weight, shifted nervously. He looked to George like a small toddler trying to inform his parent he needed to use the bathroom.<br><br>“Yeah, Blake?”<br><br>“Sorry for bothering, Mr. President, but um…” George became aware of a phone in the boy’s hand. His mind jumped between a dozen possibilities. “It’s your father. You told me to tell you if he called tonight?”<br><br>George stared at the boy, then at the phone. As if in a dream, he felt the device press itself into his hand. Blake retreated back into the corridor. There was a small click when he took the call off hold.<br><br>“Hi, Poppy,” said George. His voice seemed distant.<br><br>From thousands of miles away came the voice of George’s father. “Well, look at the mess you’ve gotten yourself into now, George. Christ.” There was a long pause. George imagined his father in his study, sipping bourbon and shaking his head at the television. “All that effort, all that money wasted on a thing like this. You know there hasn’t been a contingent since 1800? It’s gonna be an absolute shitshow.”<br><br>“We don’t know that yet, Poppy. There’s… there’s still ballots to count. There could be voter fraud. We could flip a few of these states and get over the—.”<br><br>“Oh don’t give me that horseshit. Voter fraud.” The voice was thin and mocking. “You know, when I didn’t get the nomination in 80, I at least knew how to take the punch. And I managed to get a partial victory out of the thing. I got Reagan to make me Vice President. Eight years. If you had any sense, you’d do the same.”<br><br>George was quiet. He studied his boots. “I’m not sure I get what you’re saying.”<br><br>“Of course you don’t.” A sigh. George redoubled his focus on his shoes, anything to avoid focusing directly  on the voice in his ear. “Look, Gephardt’s a good egg. We know this. He’s our kind of people, not a radical. Hell, there were some days where I felt like I was seeing double with the two of you. Heh.”<br><br>George’s gaze on his boots was intense. In its imperfections, he could see Gephardt’s smug face. Of course! It has been Gephardt’s fault all along. He’d tried to steal his thunder on the war, on taxes, the whole thing. That was the only reason Ventura has succeeded at all. Gephardt had tried to rob George of his office and his honor.<br><br>Poppy continued to prattle on, ignorant of his revelation. “Make a deal. It’ll give us a, uh, a back channel to the White House, a seat at the table when it comes to policy making. You can’t win anyways, the opposition’s too much and all struggling will do is muck up the gears of government. You gotta come out tonight and make it clear you’re not gonna obstruct—.”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>For the first time, Poppy fell silent. Then his voice returned as a low growl. “What do you mean, ‘no.’”<br><br>“I’m gonna fight it out. I’m gonna… I’m gonna… Never surrender. That’s what Rove says. I’m the decider. I’m the commander. I got Zell. I got the capital—.”<br><br>His father’s voice was sharp. He swore he could detect a hint of shock. “George, Christ, would you listen to yourself? All you’re going to do is throw the baby out with the bath water… You could make that… wrestler president. Don’t fucking—. Don’t be a goddamn child. Own up to the situation and—.”<br><br>“I’m not gonna let Gephardt steal the election, Poppy! You’re gonna see! Jeb’s gonna see! Ride or die.”<br><br>His father began to say something else, but George did not hear it. He ended the cal and placed the phone on a table, where it rang useless. <br><br>With a manic cowboy confidence, he strut out of his private chamber and into the hall. With a wild smile, he greeted his aides. He put his arm around Laura and brushed off Rove. He already knew what he wanted to say anyways. Stepping out before the crowd, he could not see their faces. He could not see the future, but he was sure Gephardt had no place in it.</p>`)

They were there as the nation tiptoed to a precipice and then, at some point past 2:00 AM, flung itself off it. Though CNN, FOX, and MSNBC had refused to call it, the old fogeys at CBS had taken a bold step into the unknown—the election was tied 269-269. For the first time since 1800, the House of Representatives would pick the president.<br><br>The enormity of the event had not yet reached those gathered in the Reagan Building. Decked in their “W” hats and American flag-patterned outfits, they looked confused more than anything. George W. Bush could see them murmuring through a tiny monitor in his makeshift green room. They were growing anxious as word spread that his opponent was planning to address their own supporters within the next few minutes. His own silence was becoming noticeable, concerning, but he could not move himself to act. For the first time in a long time, he felt sapped of his certainty.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George jumped at the sudden intrusion. He spun to see, not Rove, not his running mate, but Blake Gottesman—his bag man.

His mind jumped between a dozen possibilities. “It’s your father. You told me to tell you if he called tonight?”<br><br>George blinked. Then, as if in a dream, he beckoned for the boy to approach and took the phone from him with a shaky hand. Blake took a step backward and then vanished from the green room as George took the call off hold.<br><br>“Hi Poppy,” said George. His voice seemed distant.<br><br>From thousands of miles away came the voice of George’s father, harsh and clipped. “I’ve been on the phone with Jeb. He’s been talking with his people and he thinks that ABC is right. This thing’s going for a tie or, at the very least, an extended recount.” There was a rumble that George recognized as a sigh. “This is worse than 2000. What a goddamn mess.”<br><br>“We don’t know that yet,” murmured George. His voice seemed strangely child-like, sullen. He had a brief flash of being back in elementary school, trying to explain his report card. “There’s still absentee ballots. There’s still military ballots, you know what I’m saying? There could be fraud. K-Karl says—.”<br><br>“Jesus Christ, listen to yourself. ‘Voter fraud.’” The voice was high-pitched, mocking. “Give me a break.”<br><br>“O-okay. Maybe there’s not fraud. Maybe… I mean, we don’t gotta resignate—. I mean, I we don’t have to resign ourselves to this. There’s gonna be a run-off. We could still win in the House. That’s what happens next, right? We can still come out on top.”<br><br>He was so desperate. If Poppy could just say one positive thing, if he could give him one reassurance, everything would be okay. <br><br>Instead, there was a long and deafening silence on the other end of the receiver. “No, George. The Democrats are probably going to win the House.” He let the sentence sit there, moldering. “They’ll get sworn in and then, on January 6th, they’ll vote down the line for the Democrat. You will lose. You will be evicted from the White House. There is no reprieve coming. Christ is not going to descend from the heavens to save you. Do you understand what I’m saying?”<br><br>He was quiet. He remembered how he’d come home to Poppy drunk one night when he was in his 30s. He remembered the disgusted look on his father’s face.<br><br>“Answer me when I talk to you. Do you understand?”<br><br>George swallowed. “Yeah… Poppy. I understand.”<br><br>“Good. Jeb and I will call you tomorrow about how we can play this, but what’s important right now is you get out there. You tell the people at the Reagan Center that these results are not what you wanted but you are following them closely and you will respect the will of the voters, whatever that may be. Do you understand?”<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>“Okay. Well, if you ever listened to me, you would have done this hours ago.” Poppy gave a huff. "Just get out there before things get any worse. Don’t forget, we’ll talk tomorrow.”<br><br>And then, without ceremony, Poppy hung up. Bush allowed himself to listen to the silence for several moments. Then, he reconstructed his smile. He pretended to be jovial as he walked through rows of sullen aides. He wrapped his arm around Laura and kissed her gently on the cheek, a gesture he’d seen his father do many times before. Then, he stepped out onto the stage before the crowd. He could hear their voices but, with the stage lights blaring, he could not see their faces.</p>`)

          <p>The excitement had been building for hours inside the Reagan Building in downtown DC. First, the noncompetitive states had come in—Alabama, South Carolina, Utah—inspiring mild cheers from their partisans. Then, there’d been a raft of Republican-leaning states. These had been no great surprises; there were no stunning upsets from what the forecasters had predicted. Still, their number had steadily grown—173 to 188 to 191. The crowds had watched the screens at his Election Night party, bouncing between despair and anticipation, until finally, after midnight, CNN called it. There were still votes to be counted, but according to their projections: George W. Bush had avoided defeat. A cheer went up through the building.<br><br>He could hear their shouts echoing through the building, but the sensation George felt in his makeshift green room was exhaustion. It had been a hard four years and an even harder campaign. His body felt ragged, overused. He imagined himself as a rag doll struggling itself stitched together after weeks of being jerked around.<br><br>George was aware of a shape standing in the door. He turned and saw his personal assistant, a beanpole of a man, holding a cell phone. He forced himself to smile. “Hey, Blake, is that there the rebels calling to offer their surrender?”<br><br>His wry tone flew over the boy’s head. “Uh, no. I, uh, was able to get through to President Bush like you—. I mean, I was able to get through to your father. I know you’d wanted to talk to him before…”<br><br>George offered some vague Texan platitude, took the phone, and ushered the boy away. Then, he took a breath and took the call off hold. “Heya, Poppy. Glad you stayed up.”<br><br>There was the sound of breathing on the other end. A hand setting a glass on a coaster. “Your mother went to bed, but I’ve been talking to Jeb.” A pause as the voice on the other end took another sip of his drink. “He’ll probably want to call you when things settle down.”<br><br>“Oh!” He dulled his intelligence, willed himself to be more dense. “Well, I’ll be looking forward to that. I really will.” He wandered around the green room, busying himself by adjusting make-up bottles and peering into the tiny monitor that displayed the happy crowds in the atrium. They were playing some country song now to fill the time, something by Toby Keith. “Pretty big night. Good for everyone.”<br><br>“I suppose you managed to clear the bar and win an election.”<br><br>“Yeah, yeah… It’s gonna be a real game change from here on out, Poppy. No more having to worry about legacy, you know what I mean?” He continued staring into the tiny monitor. He wished they would cheer louder, make themselves heard to Poppy over the phone. “Things are gonna be different these next few years.”<br><br>There was a long pause. George was sure their call had been disconnected. Then, in a voice that mixed with the static came a low rumble. “No, George. It’s not.” <br><br>In the background, Toby Keith’s preening about family and country values suddenly seemed hollow and sarcastic. George gripped the phone hard.<br><br>“You’ve made your choices. There are no ‘new beginnings.’ There are no ‘fresh starts.’ You made your choices. You set this country down a path. By winning, all you did was guarantee that you’ll be the one dealing with the consequences of your actions. Nothing else.”<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>“No one’s going to bail you out of your messes for you, Junior. This isn’t Yale.”<br><br>George was quiet and stared at his feet. He swallowed to bury the heavy feeling in his throat. “Hey, Poppy, I, uh, I got to go.

          <p>The excitement had been building for hours inside the Reagan Building in downtown DC. First, the noncompetitive states had come in—Alabama, South Carolina, Utah—inspiring mild cheers from their partisans. Then, there’d been a raft of Republican-leaning states. These had been no great surprises; there were no stunning upsets from what the forecasters had predicted. Still, their number had steadily grown—173 to 188 to 191. The crowds had watched the screens at his Election Night party, bouncing between despair and anticipation, until finally, after midnight, CNN called it. There were still votes to be counted, but according to their projections: George W. Bush had avoided defeat. A cheer went up through the building.<br><br>He could hear their shouts echoing through the building, but the sensation George felt in his makeshift green room was exhaustion. It had been a hard four years and an even harder campaign. His body felt ragged, overused. He imagined himself as a rag doll struggling itself stitched together after weeks of being jerked around.<br><br>George was aware of a shape standing in the door. He turned and saw his personal assistant, a beanpole of a man, holding a cell phone. He forced himself to smile. “Hey, Blake, is that there the rebels calling to offer their surrender?”<br><br>His wry tone flew over the boy’s head. “Uh, no. I, uh, was able to get through to President Bush like you—. I mean, I was able to get through to your father. I know you’d wanted to talk to him before…”<br><br>George offered some vague Texan platitude, took the phone, and ushered the boy away. Then, he took a breath and took the call off hold. “Heya, Poppy. Glad you stayed up.”<br><br>There was the sound of breathing on the other end. A hand setting a glass on a coaster. “Your mother went to bed, but I’ve been talking to Jeb.” A pause as the voice on the other end took another sip of his drink. “He’ll probably want to call you when things settle down.”<br><br>“Oh!” He dulled his intelligence, willed himself to be more dense. “Well, I’ll be looking forward to that. I really will.” He wandered around the green room, busying himself by adjusting make-up bottles and peering into the tiny monitor that displayed the happy crowds in the atrium. They were playing some country song now to fill the time, something by Toby Keith. “Pretty big night. Good for everyone.”<br><br>“I suppose you managed to clear the bar and win an election.”<br><br>“Yeah, yeah… It’s gonna be a real game change from here on out, Poppy. No more having to worry about legacy, you know what I mean?” He continued staring into the tiny monitor. He wished they would cheer louder, make themselves heard to Poppy over the phone. “Things are gonna be different these next few years.”<br><br>There was a long pause. George was sure their call had been disconnected. Then, in a voice that mixed with the static came a low rumble. “No, George. It’s not.” <br><br>In the background, Toby Keith’s preening about family and country values suddenly seemed hollow and sarcastic. George gripped the phone hard.<br><br>“You’ve made your choices. There are no ‘new beginnings.’ There are no ‘fresh starts.’ You made your choices. You set this country down a path. By winning, all you did was guarantee that you’ll be the one dealing with the consequences of your actions. Nothing else.”<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>“No one’s going to bail you out of your messes for you, Junior. This isn’t Yale.”<br><br>George was quiet and stared at his feet. He swallowed to bury the heavy feeling in his throat. “Hey, Poppy, I, uh, I got to go.

I, uh, was able to get through to President Bush like you—. I mean, I was able to get through to your father. I know you’d wanted to talk to him before…”<br><br>George offered some vague Texan platitude, took the phone, and ushered the boy away. Then, he took a breath and took the call off hold. “Heya, Poppy. Glad you stayed up.”<br><br>There was the sound of breathing on the other end. A hand setting a glass on a coaster. “Your mother went to bed, but I’ve been talking to Jeb.” A pause as the voice on the other end took another sip of his drink. “He’ll probably want to call you when things settle down.”<br><br>“Oh!” He dulled his intelligence, willed himself to be more dense. “Well, I’ll be looking forward to that. I really will.” He wandered around the green room, busying himself by adjusting make-up bottles and peering into the tiny monitor that displayed the happy crowds in the atrium. They were playing some country song now to fill the time, something by Toby Keith. “Pretty big night. Good for everyone.”<br><br>“I suppose you managed to clear the bar and win an election.”<br><br>“Yeah, yeah… It’s gonna be a real game change from here on out, Poppy. No more having to worry about legacy, you know what I mean?” He continued staring into the tiny monitor. He wished they would cheer louder, make themselves heard to Poppy over the phone. “Things are gonna be different these next few years.”<br><br>There was a long pause. George was sure their call had been disconnected. Then, in a voice that mixed with the static came a low rumble. “No, George. It’s not.” <br><br>In the background, Toby Keith’s preening about family and country values suddenly seemed hollow and sarcastic. George gripped the phone hard.<br><br>“You’ve made your choices. There are no ‘new beginnings.’ There are no ‘fresh starts.’ You made your choices. You set this country down a path. By winning, all you did was guarantee that you’ll be the one dealing with the consequences of your actions. Nothing else.”<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>“No one’s going to bail you out of your messes for you, Junior. This isn’t Yale.”<br><br>George was quiet and stared at his feet. He swallowed to bury the heavy feeling in his throat. “Hey, Poppy, I, uh, I got to go. The crowd out here is getting pretty rowdy and they’re tellin’ me I should give my victory speech before things get out of hand. Let’s talk about this stuff later, okay?”<br><br>There was an exasperated sigh through the receiver followed by the sound of someone downing the remainder of his bourbon. “Alright. Well, I should get to bed anyway. Don’t forget that Jeb will call you. We’ll talk more in the morning.”<br><br>“Okay, love you Poppy,” said George, only to be interrupted by the sound of the call disconnecting. He let the drone of the silent telephone bore into him. He allowed himself a few brief moments of quiet before putting back on his mask of cowboy confidence and exiting his room. He forced himself to emerge and greet his many smiling aides, slapping them hard on the back or shaking their hands. Then, with Laura at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd in front of him but he could hear their voices.</p>`)

              <p>The excitement inside the Reagan building in downtown DC had been building in the hours before the polls closed. Republicans, decked in red baseball caps and pins and small American flags had descended on the building, excited to see just how badly they beat Robert Byrd. Bush campaign volunteers passed out popcorn while a projection of Fox’s Brit Hume intoned on rock-bottom Democratic turnout and the possibility of a historic outcome. New York could flip, so too could Hawaii. This could be the final, absurd defeat of the Democrat Party and the so-called anti-war movement, he informed the gleeful crowd.<br><br>Then, as the hours ticked by, air went out of the balloon. Yes, the president was on track to win victory, but it was not the historic victory they had been promised. The usual blue states slotted into their column, followed by a spattering of the Old South. At 2:00 AM, the networks called it. George W. Bush had won re-election over Robert Byrd. A cheer went up in the crowd. It sounded hollow.<br><br>In his green room, George watched a stream of the assembled people. He bit his lip as he focused on their forced smiles and awkward laughs. A campaign volunteer asked a woman to put away an enormous sign that read, “BUSH COUNTRY” and displayed the continental United States in crimson red.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George turned away from the small television. Standing in the door frame stood his Blake, his bagman. George forced himself to give the boy a smile.<br><br>“Heya, Blake,” he said with faux-cheerfulness. In the corner of his eye, he could still see the teeming crowds. Was it his imagination, or did they look smaller than they had a few minutes prior? “Just getting myself pumped for my, uh, victory speech. What can I do you for?”<br><br>“Well, congratulations, sir. I, uh, don’t want to get in the way of your work.” Blake gave the president a smile that showed no teeth. Fear gripped him. Was Blake disappointed in him too? “But you asked me to get you if your father called. The former president, I mean.”<br><br>George ignored the icy chill on his back and made a dramatic gesture. “Of course! God, Poppy! Let’s see what the old bastard has to say, huh?”<br><br>Again, Blake gave a thin toothless smile. He removed a phone from his pocket and pressed it into George’s hand before exiting. There was a click as George took the call off hold.<br><br> “Heya, Poppy. Glad you stayed up.”<br><br>There was the sound of breathing on the other end. A hand setting a glass on a coaster. “Your mother went to bed hours ago, but I’ve been talking to Jeb.” A pause as the voice on the other end took another sip of his drink. “He’ll probably want to call you when things settle down.”<br><br>“Oh!” He dulled his intelligence, willed himself to be more dense. “Well, I’ll be looking forward to that. I really will.” He wandered around the green room, busying himself by adjusting make-up bottles. Anything to focus his gaze on something other than the stream of his rally. “Important to hear from the, uh, best and brightest for the next four years.”<br><br>Poppy gave a non-commital grunt. “If that’s what you think. Not the result I’d use to launch any big projects, but you never did follow my advice.”<br><br>“I won the election, Poppy.”<br><br>“Did you now? A bare victory against an out-of-touch geriatric… Robert Byrd… God.” ” George could almost see Poppy shaking his head. “You’re lucky they didn’t run a real candidate this year. God, if Clinton had run—.”<br><br>“I’d have beat her too,” George said, but for some reason his voice sounded whiny. <br><br>“If that’s what you say, but… don’t be surprised if the usual people on Capitol Hill aren’t taking your ‘mandate’ seriously. They smell blood in the water and no one’s gonna be able to bail you out.”<br><br>George was quiet and stared at his feet. He swallowed to bury the heavy feeling in his throat. “Hey, Poppy, I, uh, I got to go. The crowd out here is getting pretty rowdy and they’re tellin’ me I should give my victory speech before things get out of hand.

Let’s talk about this stuff later, okay?”<br><br>There was an exasperated sigh through the receiver followed by the sound of someone downing the remainder of his bourbon. “Alright. Well, I should get to bed anyway. Don’t forget that Jeb will call you. We’ll talk more in the morning.”<br><br>“Okay, love you Poppy,” said George, only to be interrupted by the sound of the call disconnecting. He let the drone of the silent telephone bore into him. He allowed himself a few brief moments of quiet before putting back on his mask of cowboy confidence and exiting his room. He forced himself to emerge and greet his many smiling aides, slapping them hard on the back or shaking their hands. Then, with Laura at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd in front of him but he could hear their voices.</p>`)

          <p>He could hear them chanting inside the Reagan Building’s atrium. He could feel the vibrations from their shouts and stomping as state after state turned a crimson red. “FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS!” Fox had called the race an hour ago, followed quickly by CNN. The haters at MSNBC still held out, sustained by half-memories of 2000 and delirious hopes regarding absentee ballots, but it wouldn’t be long until they too surrendered. He was certain of it. He took a swig of his non-alcoholic beer as the voices surged again. “FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS!”<br><br>He was aware of a hesitant knock on the door of his makeshift green room, but he did not turn. He was too busy luxuriating in the love of the crowd. He closed his eyes and imagined the liberals in Washington weeping and tearing out their hair. He imagined them throwing themselves off buildings.<br><br>“Sir?” <br><br>George stifled a frown and turned. Silhouetted against the doorway stood his bag man. His lips were tight and arms crossed. In one hand was a cell phone. At once, the energy of the moment coursed back into him.<br><br>“Is it…?”<br><br>The boy nodded. “President Bush, I mean, your father called back to…”<br><br>He scrambled across the room and jerked the phone out of the boy’s hands before ushering him to leave. With excitement, he took the call off hold. “Hiya, Poppy!” His voice was shrill and schoolboyish. “Did ya see the results?” <br><br>“I flicked through the channels.” There was a long silence. “Almost as impressive as what I did in ‘88.”<br><br>The words felt like a knife through his skull. George forced himself to smile. “Yeah, exactly, Poppy…” He walked around the room. In a small monitor, he could see the atrium. He could see the people shouting his name. “I worked real hard for this and not just for me, for Jeb, for the party, for you…”<br><br>Static came through the receiver. “What do you want me to say, George? ‘Good job?’”<br><br>He stared intensely at the monitor, at the individual pixels. The scene lost coherence. A mass of red and blues. “Yeah, I, I…”<br><br>“Well, Christ. ‘Good job.’” The voice was dull, monotonous. George let it bore into him. “Truly, this is a great victory for the family and the party. This will transform Washington and put your name in the history books. Your mother and I are so proud of what you’ve accomplished.” George gripped the receiver hard and listened to his father’s breathing. “Is there anything else you wanted from me? Advice? Finally going to ask me for suggestions on how to handle the next four years?”<br><br>George felt himself shaking his head. “N-no, Poppy. Maybe later. Just… um… are you gonna watch my speech?”<br><br>There was a long sigh. Suppressed agitation. “It’s late, George. We’ll catch the replay tomorrow. If there’s nothing else, Barbara and I should get to bed. Good night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George allowed himself to stand in silence for a few moments in the green room before recomposing his smile.

Just… um… are you gonna watch my speech?”<br><br>There was a long sigh. Suppressed agitation. “It’s late, George. We’ll catch the replay tomorrow. If there’s nothing else, Barbara and I should get to bed. Good night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George allowed himself to stand in silence for a few moments in the green room before recomposing his smile.

Then, with Laura at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd in front of him but he could hear their voices.</p>`)

              <p>The excitement inside the Reagan building in downtown DC had been building in the hours before the polls closed. Republicans, decked in red baseball caps and pins and small American flags had descended on the building, excited to see just how badly they beat Robert Byrd. Bush campaign volunteers passed out popcorn while a projection of Fox’s Brit Hume intoned on rock-bottom Democratic turnout and the possibility of a historic outcome. New York could flip, so too could Hawaii. This could be the final, absurd defeat of the Democrat Party and the so-called anti-war movement, he informed the gleeful crowd.<br><br>As the hours ticked by, things went along steadily. The president was on track to win victory, and by a margin fit for the christening of what those journalists were calling his “new Republican Party.” Byrd was struggling in the usual blue states, even if a few seemed set to fall into their traditional columns. He was improving on Gore in the Old South, but not by enough to stop the red wave washing over the country. Well before midnight, the networks called it. George W. Bush had won re-election over Robert Byrd. A cheer went up in the crowd.<br><br>In his green room, George watched a stream of the assembled people. He bit his lip as he focused on their forced smiles and awkward laughs. He watched a woman wave an enormous sign that read, “BUSH COUNTRY” and displayed the continental United States in crimson red. <br>But on the TV, the networks were talking about Byrd: what states the old man might actually end up winning, where he had found an appeal, what it might mean. It was like the Republican wins weren’t worth bringing up. George didn’t understand why. He felt like a ghost.<br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George turned away from the small television. Standing in the door frame stood his Blake, his bagman. George forced himself to give the boy a smile.<br><br>“Heya, Blake,” he said with faux-cheerfulness. In the corner of his eye, he could still see the teeming crowds. “Just getting myself pumped for my, uh, victory speech. What can I do you for?”<br><br>“Well, congratulations, sir. I, uh, don’t want to get in the way of your work.” Blake gave the president a smile that showed no teeth. “But you asked me to get you if your father called. The former president, I mean.”<br><br>He walked robotically across the room and took the phone out of the boy’s hands before ushering him to leave. After staring at it for a second, he took the call off hold. “Hiya, Poppy!” He tried to make himself sound upbeat. “Did ya see the results?” <br><br>“I flicked through the channels.” There was a long silence. “On paper, it’s almost as impressive as what I did in ‘88. It makes me wonder how that might have gone if my opponent back then had one foot in the grave.”<br><br>The words felt like a knife through his skull. George forced himself to smile. “Sure, Poppy…” He walked around the room. In a small monitor, he could see the atrium. He could see the people shouting his name. “This could be historic, you know? It’s almost midnight, and Fox still hasn’t called any states for the old bastard yet. I don’t wanna count any chickens before they hatch, but…”<br><br>Static came through the receiver. “What do you want me to say, George? ‘Good job?’”<br><br>He stared intensely at the monitor, at the individual pixels. The scene lost coherence. A mass of reds and beiges. “Yeah, I, I…”<br><br>“Well, Christ. ‘Good job.’” The voice was dull, monotonous. George let it bore into him. “Truly, this is a great victory for the family and the party. Nobody ever thought that you could win by so much against a dementia patient with a Black running mate. Your triumph will ring out for all time.” George gripped the receiver hard and listened to his father’s breathing. “Is there anything else you wanted from me? Advice? Finally going to ask me for suggestions on how to handle the next four years?”<br><br>George felt himself shaking his head. He stepped back from the TV and looked at the national map. It was hard to recognize the name on the screen as his own. “N-no, Poppy. Maybe later. Just… um… are you gonna watch my speech?”<br><br>There was a long sigh. Suppressed agitation. “It’s late, George. We’ll catch the replay tomorrow. If there’s nothing else, Barbara and I should get to bed. Good night.”<br><br>The line went dead.

              <p>The Ronald Reagan Building in downtown DC shuddered. Within its confines, stood a thousand stamping Republicans. Over the course of the evening, they had watched the election returns with breathless anticipation, not worried by the possibility of defeat but instead excited by the promise of a final, cataclysmic victory over the enemy. They waved their tiny flags as the massive image of Brit Hume was projected overhead.<br><br>The crowd trilled as Kentucky and Indiana turned red. They roared as the wave overtook Ohio and Florida. Their bodies shuddered as the red wave flooded into Illinois, New York, and Hawaii. At 2:00 AM, Brit Hume took in a deep breath, and announced that George W. Bush had done the unthinkable. He had won Washington, DC. He had become the first Republican in the history of the country to win all 538 votes. They had called the president insane for his visits to the District and his voter outreach. This was a historic occasion, not one with any parallel in the modern age. Not since Washington had the nation—.<br><br>In his green room, George Bush muted his television. He continued to watch as Hume mouthed empty words into the camera, names and faces appearing beneath him. There was a clip of his own rally, the mood bordering on religious ecstasy. There was a picture flashed across the screen of himself, younger, standing next to Jeb and his father. He continued to watch the silent images, which lapsed into an ad for Vicks VapoRub. The tagline promised relief in seconds.<br><br>George looked down at his feet and tried to focus intensely on the muffled cheering just outside. By all accounts, he had achieved the stupendous, something impossible. In just two years, he had turned himself from a laughing stock to a kind of icon. He was a uniter. A liberator. A decider. He had vanquished every enemy, foreign and domestic, and achieved everything he had set out to do. <br><br>Why, then, did his achievement feel so fleeting? Why did he feel so hollow? He gazed into the television and instead of focusing on the picture, all he could see was his own ghostly reflection in the glass. <br><br>There was a knock on the door. George put on his best smile and invited the guest to enter. In walked his bagman, Blake. He continued smiling as the overgrown boy removed a small Blackberry from his pocket.<br><br>“Well, first of all, congratulations, sir,” said Blake. George nodded good-naturedly. “Your father just called. I know you wanted to talk with him and…”<br><br>“Of course, thank you kindly, Blake. You tell Turd Blossom that I’m gonna talk to Poppy and then I’ll be right out,” He forced a chuckle. “Can’t let these good people wait any longer for this, er, histrionic occasion.”<br><br>Blake gave a laugh and then shut the door. George flipped the phone to his ear. “Well, hiya, Poppy. I was wondering when you’d call.” The remark felt pointed and aggressive, but he needed to feel something beyond this dull ache. He needed Poppy to provide him with something to make sense of what was happening. “I trust you gotta be happy with tonight’s outcome?”<br><br>“Well, it’s historic. That’s what they keep saying on the television anyways,” Poppy sounded like he was sucking on a piece of sour candy. In his mind’s eye, George could see his father’s tight-lipped expression and the empty glass of bourbon on his desk. “I suppose many consider it impressive.”<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>"Yeah?" His father said.<br><br>The void inside him was yawning. The pain was constant. “Yeah, Poppy. It is. I don’t know what more you want me to say.”<br><br>““I just want to make sure… it's important that you not let this get to your head... There's an old saying about 'showboating'...'" Poppy drifted off. "It would have been easy to let things go to my head after I won a landslide against Dukakis in ‘88, but I focused on uniting the country… on bringing people together.”<br><br>George said nothing. He felt inconsolable. <br><br>“This is about uniting the country, not stroking your ego."<br><br>The television had returned to broadcasting the pandemonium inside the Ronald Reagan Center. The screen was alight with raining confetti and red and white banners with his name emblazoned on them. He saw a thousand signs with his own smiling face and a bright letter “W” imposed on the wall. George had never felt more desolate in his life. "Sure, Poppy."<br><br>"DC didn't used to be this Democratic stronghold, you know" The voice on the other end of the receiver seemed distant. "And this election’s unusual, but there's been plenty of people who won landslides before…"<br><br>It had finally become unbearable. "Poppy, I'm afraid I gotta head out. Rove's standing right next to me and pushing me to give my victory speech." <br><br>" …who kept in mind the... dignity of the office... the responsibility..."<br><br>"Okay, I'll talk to you soon, Poppy.”<br><br>"They knew they served beneath the Great Seal and—."<br><br>He hung up the phone and was once again alone. He was aware now that there was no hope of transcendence, no possibility of metanoia or spiritual conversion. Standing at the mountaintop and gazing down at the world below, what he felt now was indifference. A void in himself that would never be filled. An entire lifetime of striving to prove himself good enough—for nothing. <br><br>He stood a moment longer, then un-hunched his shoulders. With a cowboy’s confidence, he forced himself to emerge from his green room and greet his many smiling aides, slapping them hard on the back or shaking their hands. Then, with Laura at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd before him but, then again, he no longer cared.</p>`)

Your mother and I are so proud of what you’ve accomplished.” George gripped the receiver hard and listened to his father’s breathing. “Is there anything else you wanted from me? Advice? Finally going to ask me for suggestions on how to handle the next four years?”<br><br>George felt himself shaking his head. “N-no, Poppy. Maybe later. Just… um… are you gonna watch my speech?”<br><br>There was a long sigh. Suppressed agitation. “It’s late, George. We’ll catch the replay tomorrow. If there’s nothing else, Barbara and I should get to bed. Good night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George allowed himself to stand in silence for a few moments in the green room before recomposing his smile. With a cowboy’s confidence, he forced himself to emerge and greet his many smiling aides, slapping them hard on the back or shaking their hands. Then, with Laura at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd in front of him but he could hear their voices.</p>`)

          <p>The mood was sour as so-called “President” Bush paced outside the Oval Office. While Cheney had never really cared about what Bush did or how he felt, things had become downright flagrant as his “presidency” came to a close. Before, Cheney had at least put in the effort to distract Bush while he ran the country from behind the scenes. Now, he just didn’t care. As he waited to sit behind his favorite desk, all Bush had to focus his small brain on was the voice of Rush from a staffers office.<br><br>“You know, Snerdly, we ask a lot on this show what the difference between what this Bush and his pappy is supposed to be. I think the answer’s been staring us in the face the whole time. It’s in the name! The dad was H.W., this one is W. Bush. And you know what that missing H stands for? It’s history! This President will not be remembered by history at all, except as the least consequential ‘leader’ this nation has ever seen. Back then, I marveled at how the media covered Bush 41 as this wimp, no matter how much he gave to them, because he was actually quite strong. He went after Saddam. They said “No war for oil!” and he didn’t blink. But his son wanted those dittoheads to love him, so he did nothing. And they still hate him anyway! It should teach us conservatives a lesson that Ford is learning the hard way: you can’t get very far with a worse version of an old model…”<br><br>Just as Bush couldn’t take it anymore, Cheney walked through the door. Swiftly stepping out of the way, Bush spoke, staring at the floor.<br><br>“So, heh, hey, Dick. How are things going?”<br><br>Cheney turned, looking at him with a scowl. “That’s none of your business.”<br><br>Bush chucked like a moron as he lifted his gaze from the ground. “You know, Dick, I was gonna say. Technically, I mean, now that Frist is here, you haven’t been Veep for a few years. So I was thinking that, considering that, that, maybe, heh, you could give me some more time in the Office? At least while I’m on the way out?”<br><br>Cheney scowled even harder. “Shut the fuck up.” He spat on him and walked away.<br><br>Having braved through the least humiliating thing to happen to him that day, Bush moved towards the Resolute Desk to pretend that he was an actual President. Sitting in his chair, he looked down and saw what Cheney had been working on all day. It was the first draft of his memoirs, titled <i>Monkey See, Monkey Do</i>. Flipping through them at random, he settled on a paragraph in the book’s second chapter.<br><br>“—and that was how I got his dumbass bill through Congress. Honestly, I didn’t think it was even a good idea, but I thought, hey, if this moron can’t get <i>anything</i> through, it might start reflecting badly on me, you know? And with a normal president, there’s usually a tit-for-tat here: I help him out, he helps me out. But then when it comes to doing the most basic shit to <s>trade blood for oil</s> [EDITOR’S NOTE: make sure to lie here], he was too much of a coward to do it! God, he’s such a dipshit. Anyways—”<br><br>Bush couldn’t bear to read any further. He was devastated. Feeling completely helpless, he prayed to the Lord.<br><br>“Oh, God, tell me, why must I suffer so? I have been defiled as Huckabee has rebuked all of my efforts. Condemned by Dick as he has taken credit for my works. Played the fool by Rush as he has condemned me as a footnote. Are the peacemakers not your children? Somebody tag in God. God, if you can hear me, God, please save me. Please save me, God, please. I’m asking you.”<br><br>Suddenly, he felt a presence and heard a voice from the Heavens. “Do not be afraid, my child. I have been watching. Know that all that has happened over these eight years was by my design. You should fear not, as all that has occurred is exactly what you wanted.”<br><br>Shrieking, Bush jumped and hid behind “his” desk. Trembling, he asked, “Oh, Lord, how can this be? How can this be what I wanted? In spite of my trials, I have nothing.”<br><br>For a moment, God was silent. Then, he spoke. “Oops. Wrong George Bush. Uhhh. Darn. My bad.” The presence left as quickly as it came.<br><br>Still trembling, Bush slowly stood up, looking outside the window of the Oval Office. It was snowing that April. The lawn was immaculately trimmed, the hard work of people who had actually held a real job once in their lives. Staring at the falling snow much as an infant would at a set of jangling keys, he moved his gaze towards the hedges just outside the window. Hidden beneath the white blankets of snow, the White House greenery appeared smaller than usual. What once looked like a mighty bush now seemed to be nothing more than a lowly shrub. <br><br>The plant looked back at the “President.” It had no eyes, but it saw itself.</p>`)

          <p><i>Misfire</i><br>by Bob Woodward<br>Simon & Schuster, 390 pp., $22.95<br><i>Shadow War: The Hidden History of Afghanistan from the Soviets to the Americans</i><br>by Sam Gold<br>Penguin Press, 710 pp., $39.95<br><br>SEPTEMBER 19, 2007 ISSUE<br><br>On the cusp of the American invasion’s fourth anniversary next month, I found myself chatting with a well-off contractor in his newly constructed villa. If you looked around the capital city—which had been so eviscerated by clashing factions in the 1990’s—you would be forgiven for wondering if there was even a war going on. But my wealthy host told me such fantasies don’t outlast their first brush with the countryside. “Go east, and you’ll be mugged by reality,” he said with a grin.<br><br>Those in another capital city we call Washington seem to forget we are currently at war in Afghanistan too, judging by the conflicting answers one gets when they pose a simple question to any official in government: just how many Americans are fighting in Afghanistan? “Fuck if I know,” one veteran State Department analyst sighed. Officially, the Pentagon discloses that 24,000 American troops are in the country, and that’s not counting the number of contractors, which is at least double. Most troops are stationed in Kabul and a handful of other provincial capitals. <br><br>The brunt of the fighting is done by proxy forces—scattered militias recruited for petty cash, the much-lambasted Afghan National Police Force, and opium smugglers. It’s a fact which the CIA is finding harder to deny, considering the news elsewhere in the region.<br><br>The latter is something most Americans only hear about in the context of the ongoing Iraqi insurgency—or liberation/terrorist movement, depending on who you ask. Salafist militant groups have festered since the late 1990s in the country, when <i>mujahideen</i> veterans (known as the “Arab Afghans” by the CIA veterans of that earlier dirty war) returned to their homes across the Mid-East, coinciding with a weakening of the Iraqi government via sanctions, bombings, and more. With many of al-Qaeda’s top leaders eluding capture in Afghanistan, plenty have turned up in propaganda videos produced by violent groups in Iraq. Their rank-and-file have been kept alive via a lifeline of poppy production back in Afghanistan, raising enough money for arms on the black market.<br><br>Today, most American news is filled with images of bombed out buses and Shia Muslims fleeing their family homes for fear of reprisal, all while an increasingly feeble Saddam Hussein vows “annihilation” for those who oppose him. UN debates over whether acts of any side of this bloody conflict constitute intent to destroy particular protected groups will drag on for many months. But if you scour the dark corners of the internet, the origins of this war are already solved. Plenty of conspiracy blogs feed their paranoid readers visions of darkened C-130s dropping weapons to the Jihadist groups like Jama'at, all while pointing to the fabled Operation Cyclone of the 1980s as precedent for American intelligence agencies arming radical Islamist groups.<br><br>Their fuzzy view of history notwithstanding, foreign intervention in the Iraqi bloodshed is the worst kept secret of the war. Those planes full of weapons for fighters eager to oust Saddam may not have come directly from the Americans, but they certainly were sent by our close Gulf allies. As for the surge in alarming sectarian hatred across the region, one has to ask our friends in the House of Saud about their recent record media buy to put hatemongers on the air in the Middle East’s biggest television networks. Those madrassas don’t build themselves.<br><br>But it would be all too easy to simply shrug the chaos off as an incurable disease afflicting the region, beset by religious extremism. We have plenty of that at home in spades. If you want to witness what our own hatemongers look like on TV, don’t forget just how eager many of our finest commentators were to tout the most absurd fabrications about Saddam Hussein just a few short years ago. Now, as Bob Woodward shows in his latest expose of the Bush White House, most of these sources came straight from the top.<br><br>Despite the tumult in the administration over their ultimate failure to go to war, there’s zero indication it’s fallen from the president’s agenda. Three separate White House sources have told me that President Bush is a “fanatic” about Saddam. “There’s nobody else on the planet who makes the president as nuts as that asshole does,” remarked one administration official. Beyond the rants and ravings from the president about how “this guy tried to kill my dad,” that Woodward’s earlier book made headlines for, there’s still a real ideological fervor for any plan that would remove Saddam Hussein from power.<br><br>Even with all the firings in the wake of the debacle over whether to vote for an invasion of Iraq, all roads lead back to the same group of neoconservatives who had such great influence over the president in his first few years in office. “They never really left,” a senior source tells Woodward. “You see them bitching on the Sunday shows now and then, whether it’s about North Korea or whatever, but the president talks with them all on a practically daily basis.” <br><br>One hardly needs to be a Straussian to read between the lines on the latest headlines about the Iraqi crisis. The largest U.S. military aid package to Saudi Arabia in history was confirmed earlier this year, despite serious questions from Congress over allegations that they protected senior al-Qaeda leaders who escaped from Afghanistan. The next month, <i>The Washington Post</i> reports that a Saudi prince promised leaders of the Iraqi insurgents billions worth of arms in a Riyadh meeting. Now, still limping from his last attempt, President Bush is sounding the alarm on Saddam again. “Some folks like to stop before the job is done,” he told the White House press pool, grimacing, “but that’s not the way we do business here.” That trademark Texas charm was gone. All that was left was barely concealed rage.<br><br>As Woodward reports, after the press conference, Bush muttered to him, “we’re gonna do it goddamn right this time.”</p>`)

The Bush team got blasted for their ‘Mission Accomplished’ stunt last year by the same people who were going to attack him anyway. But it worked. The American people saw their commander-in-chief not as a wisened statesman, but a cocky flyboy, ready to blast some bad guys and wipe out undemocratic regimes around the world. <br><br>Inside Iraq, there’s a smattering of protests from washed up Saddam loyalists, but de-Ba'athification is accelerating, and thousands more former foot-soldiers of the regime will be detained in the next six months, I’m told. A senior official involved in planning the operation conveyed that most of them will be going to the same facility at Camp Bucca. Others will be placed in smaller prison sites around the country.

After the Bush team installed the Iraqi Governing Council, they stacked it with Shia leaders, to better reflect the Iraqi population than Saddam’s tyrannical government ever did. The Sunni provinces in the country are nothing to worry about, and the U.S. should not expend any resources on areas like al-Anbar, or cities like Fallujah. They are quiet now, and they will remain quiet. <br><br>Lastly, we’re not only defeating terrorists who are a threat to the entire Middle East, but we’re preventing any future ones from carrying out their vile acts. The Bush team argued for the invasion by rightly pointing out that Saddam allowed the terrorist mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to live freely in Iraq. Bush’s critics could never counter this one, and today, you don’t hear much about Zarqawi anymore. Sure, it’s because no one has found him yet, but it’s only a matter of time. So with this fantastic record, why isn’t the White House advertising it more often?

          <p>May 29 2005<br><br>Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is the best thing that’s happened since the 2002 midterm elections. I mean after the god-awful Attack of the Clones, I wondered how much more George Lucas could possibly fuck up Star Wars. But son of a bitch, he did it. Now you may have heard that the movie was screened at the Cannes film festival, for a bunch of French snobs sipping wine. But when George started speaking after the credits rolled, he told them directly what the movie was about: that <i>other</i> George.<br><br>That’s right. Step aside, Michael Moore, we’ve got a new hero in town. Now I wasn’t sure if George was just giving those French bastards a show, so I had to see this one for myself. After all, this is the man who thought adding CGI bullshit to the goddamn Original Trilogy was his lasting legacy. But my god, Revenge of the Sith was not only a good movie, it was a real dagger to the heart of the regime in Washington. When Anakin told Obi-Wan “you’re either with me, or you’re my enemy” I could just about picture a single tear rolling down Shrub’s cheek. Cheney is probably ordering a preemptive strike on Skywalker Ranch and calling in special forces to raid movie theaters around the country as I type this.<br><br>This is a film every American needs to see to be eligible to vote. If every citizen heard the line “so this is how liberty dies…with thunderous applause” before last November, they might have voted out the chimp. Maybe they would have spared us from this goddamned war. Maybe the religious nuts (the ones as crazy as Bush’s donors, but from a different book) wouldn’t blow up city blocks with their suicide vests every couple days. Hell, maybe those thousands of American sailors wouldn’t be at the bottom of the fucking Persian Gulf.<br><br>If that traitor at Crawford ever saw this film, he'd see the face of Anakin reflected right at him. Another boy with daddy issues who gets taken in by some old pervert with a ballsack for a face and decides to conquer the universe, one classroom full of kids at a time. The NRA knows a thing or two about that. <br><br>Right now, the most important thing we can do to protest that unelected tyrant in Washington is to support movies like Revenge of the Sith. They’re all we have left. After coming home from the theater, I saw the latest news about another attack in New York, and I couldn’t help but think whether that nutjob who pulled the ripcord on his vest wouldn’t have taken all those lives if he had listened to what Obi-Wan told Anakin on Mustafar as he was lit on fire. Either way, this is the type of film that’s going to stand the test of time. Hopefully George doesn’t put out a special edition to this one. After all, we know how this story ends. The rebels win, Darth Vader is redeemed, and the Emperor explodes. Now that’s one hell of an impeachment.<br><br>Jedi Master Anthony<br>—-------------------------------------<br><br>“It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.” —Tyler Durden</p>`)

          <p>Warner Bros. email hack raises tensions<br>BY ED HONEY<br>JUNE 27, 2006 4:00AM<br><br>Investigators are probing the origins of a major security breach of <i>Warner Brothers</i>’ internal servers. A trove of emails were leaked, including embarrassing exchanges between top talent and studio execs, while entire scripts of highly anticipated films, like the next <i>Harry Potter</i>, were released in their entirety. <br><br>The FBI has already found significant leads, and <i>THR </i>can report that they’re pointing to an unlikely source: North Korea. The embattled communist dictatorship in East Asia evidently waged an act of “cyber terrorism” against Warner Bros to release such highly embarrassing material. This follows nearly 18 months of intermittent warfare with South Korea, and naval incidents with U.S. warships. While the regime has not taken responsibility for the leak, their state media has made numerous bellicose statements against the studio in recent months, targeting next month’s Harold and Kumar Go To Pyongyang, a sequel to the stoner comedy <i>Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle</i>.<br><br>While stoner comedies provoking the ire of a dictatorship obsessed with nuclear weapons may sound like a bad script, senior White House officials insist this isn’t Hollywood. “That movie came out at the worst possible time,” one anonymous source sighed. President Bush has strongly threatened a ground invasion of the North, and the November 2004 airstrikes against dozens of sites across the country nearly provoked a nuclear conflict. After South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun’s diplomatic intervention prevented a full-scale war, border clashes have heightened tensions, and the possibility of a resumption of the Korean War remains. Now, the <i>WB </i>hack severely complicates matters.<br><br>In a speech on June 15th, Bush gave what multiple sources close to the president tell <i>THR </i>was a shot across the bow to North Korean officials. “We consider any action against the United States military, our nation, or our way of life to be an act of war,” the president stated. “This can be military action, like when two ships start shooting at each other, or it can be through other methods. We know what they are, and we will retaliate with all the force it takes.” Now, the White House is reportedly considering their options against Kim Jong Il’s regime, including military action.<br><br>During the Baengnyeongdo incident in 2005, it was widely reported that the White House was hours away from triggering a massive preemptive strike against North Korea, potentially involving nuclear weapons. The November 2004 conflict has been well-publicized by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, whose book <i>Strike</i> released earlier this year. In one passage, Woodward recounts a conversation between Bush and Cheney where the president asked “hell, why don’t we just drop a nuke on the damn place?” The only thing reportedly stopping the president from triggering a nuclear strike on the Korean peninsula was the intervention of Secretary of State Colin Powell, who resigned last week. On Monday, President Bush announced he was appointing United Nations Ambassador John Bolton to fill the role.<br><br>Harold and Kumar Go To Pyongyang launches on July 14th.</p>`)

              <p><b>[THIS FILE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED. PLEASE OPEN AND REPAIR TO AN EARLIER VERSION.]</b><br><br>...As the Chinese missiles climbed into space, they came into full view of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, originally the National Missile Defense system, in Alaska. Inaugurated in June 2002 at Fort Greely, it saw various improvements through July 2004. The system represented the largest and most sophisticated anti-missile defense system on earth despite the many compromises made in its design.<br><br>While DoD staff were publicly laudatory about the system and the Alaska National Guard Troops who managed it, they privately criticized the various malfunctions it demonstrated during testing. The failure rate during drills was high. Even if it had not been, officials worried about whether the system could operate effectively in an exchange scenario. “There was no way to prove its effectiveness before the crisis,” said one DoD official. “We t▯lked about it being the ‘last line of defense,’ but it was always more a shiny deterrence system than anything ready for prime time.’”<br><br>Indeed, despite the technological sophistication of this system—possible due to an estimated ▯▯▯▯llion-dollar in▯estment—it faced certain unavoidable scientific truths. In any exchange scenario, guardsmen would have an extremely narrow range during which to intercept targets. A long-range m▯ssile is almost impossible to hit while all its engines are firing. As a warhead falls to earth, it reaches twenty times the speed of sound, making it almost impossible to intercept. Only between these moments—the “midcourse” when a hot warhead is drifting through space—is it possible to shoot down. This period is, at most, a f▯w minutes in length if a missile is detec▯▯d at launch. It can be mere seconds if radar systems fail to detect an incoming warhead in time̶.̴ ̵<br><br>S̴o̴ ̵i̸t̵ was on November 2, 2004. With no warning or preparation, a skeleton crew of Alaska National Guard troops became charged with using the nation’s forty-four operational interceptors to defend the United States against an estimated 500 incoming warheads. Operators would have little knowledge of which missiles were aimed at which target nor would they have been able to think critically during the short time frame. Given that the GMD had a success rate of only about 50 percent—even under ideal testing conditions—those manning the interceptors would have had to accommodate accordingly. <br><br>Acting Secretary of Defense Stephen C▯▯▯ｏne—who declined to cooperate but had commented on nuclear defense and readiness prior to the incident—has offered his own, blunt view about what this accommodation lik▯▯▯ would have been:<br><br>“F̷i̸r̸e̸ ̵a̶ ̶l̸o̵t̷ ̴o̵f̷ interceptors at every missile and hope you get lucky.”<br><br>Staff have been unable to find a surviving member of the Ala▯▯▯ National Guard to confirm this fact. It is disputed by surviving Executive staff whether the GMD system successfully intercepted any Chi▯▯▯▯ missiles on November 2, 2004.<br><br>CHAPTER IV: “WHEELS UP”<br><br>According to witness testimony and fli▯ht records, President Bush’s helicopter landed on the tarmac of Des Moines International Airport at 11:08 PM, three minutes after departing Theodore Roosevelt High School, eight minutes after polls closed in California, and 12 minutes before the impact of the Chinese ICBM targeted on the president’s location.

As Vice President, my principal focus has been to protect the American people and our way of life. Though I’ve faced many challenges in this time, none represent those posed by the lawless regime overseen by Vladimir Putin, who has rejected every hand of friendship in favor of violence. Even now, his allies have embarked on a senseless campaign of shelling the Republic of Georgia. Our intelligence leaders—who have been unwaveringly diligent and committed to preserving the democratic zone of peace—indicate he intends to expand these operations in an attempt to restore the old Russian empire.<br><br>While I never sought the immense responsibility placed on me at this precise moment, as our president faces a serious medical procedure and is rendered unable to serve as commander-in-chief, I cannot shirk my duties either. I have a special obligation to the brave members of our armed forces, intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, and others who serve and sacrifice to keep us free. My oath of office calls me to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, even if that means taking tough decisions that others may criticize. I accept this criticism as part of our free and fair process.<br><br>Tomorrow, you will wake up in a new world. While my advisors reassure me that our national defenses are strong and more than capable of preventing attacks from reaching American soil, all defenses are imperfect and there may be some costs to the actions which I am about to undertake. I want you all to know that I carefully considered the options available and elected to take a path that inflicted the least harm, that would minimize the loss of life for our patriotic men and women and permanently eradicate a threat to a free and democratic world order.<br><br>As you grow, you will come to understand the sacrifices that each generation makes to preserve freedom and democracy for future generations. One day, you will assume the important responsibilities of citizens in our society. God willing, you will not face the same kinds of choices that I do now. Whatever the future holds, I ask of you as my grandchildren what I asked of my daughters, that you always strive in your lives to do what is right.<br><br><br><blockquote>May God bless and protect you.<br><br>Richard B. Cheney<br>Acting President of the United States<br>(Grandpa Cheney)</blockquote><br><br>***<br><br>NOTE: Scooter, make sure we send this over to the Weekly Standard once the dust settles.

I want to thank everyone in attendance tonight, and say hello to everyone entering and serving in the 110th Congress. (Applause)<br><br><b>PRESIDENT SHARPTON</b>: And as we stand here today, I want to thank, first and foremost, Minority Leader Pastor for all we’ve been able to accomplish these past two years. Already, we’ve seen greater expansion of voting rights for those from the Mexican border to the most disadvantaged of us on the reservations, who have struggled for so long. We’ve begun a new discussion on criminal justice, focusing more and more on why the crime was committed, not who it was done by. And though our party has lost the House of Representatives, I have no fear that House Speaker DeLay will senselessly block the initiatives we will continue to work through Congress. (Applause)<br><br><b>PRESIDENT SHARPTON</b>: And that’s not all. We’ve gotten boots steadily off the ground from Afghanistan, and we’ll continue to do just that. And in these next two years, we’ll begin to expand on that even more, empowering the United Nations across the world and increasing our cooperation with our European allies. I won’t let campaigning distract our work, either; in these next two years, and with cooperation from our friends in Congress, work on overhauling our welfare and housing projects will begin. With help from America’s mayors, including my friend, Mark Green, we’ll embrace urban renewal again. I survived my childhood because of public housing projects that let the impoverished have a chance, and I want to give more people suffering through hard times another chance. And that’s not even all.<br><br><b>PRESIDENT SHARPTON</b>: Our nation’s economy is better than ever, and is staying that way. Our crime rates are down, our policing practices are so much greater, and our troops are home. And now we’re in a position to make it even better.

A voiceover promising the viewers that there’s a better way, that this grim reality isn’t all there is, that they can <i>change things</i>.<br><br>Does this description best fit ISIL’s terrifying propaganda videos proliferating over every dark corner of the internet? Or Mike Huckabee’s latest campaign ad sent out over Iowa networks this week?<br><br>Why not both?<br><br>ISIL’s propaganda mill has <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>alarmed experts in both videography and mapping religious extremists</u></span>. Their videos rack up millions of views, and are often shown on mainstream American cable news channels like FOX or CNN. Wellstone even had to address them at a <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>press conference last month</u></span>, stressing he was “strongly concerned” by the uptick in American recruits for the terrorist group, but urging that “these maniacs prey on fear, and we can’t play into that.”<br><br>The group uses sophisticated animation techniques in their videos, and has increasingly targeted U.S. political figures across both parties—<span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Wellstone</u></span>, <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>George Bush</u></span>, and <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>John McCain</u></span> are frequently shown. It’s hard not to notice the similarities to our own political propaganda during election season. A candidate will air attack ads against their opponent, painting them as out-of-touch, corrupt, or even blasphemous.<br><br>“It goes even further than just the video techniques,” said Erin Hart, an expert on religious extremist movements at Harvard. “ISIL’s whole appeal is to young frustrated men in the west, often from well-educated middle class families, who feel that the world has slighted them. ISIL preys on this by catering to their misogyny certainly, but also feelings of abandonment in an increasingly globalized world.”<br><br>In a widely circulated <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>open letter signed by hundreds of Imams and Islamic scholars</u></span> this February, ISIL’s total rejection of centuries of scholarship was stressed. But again, Hart explains, that’s something the group plays into. “They’re very anti-establishment in that way, tilting themselves against vast fields of study, which they just toss into the wood-chipper. They’re intensely individualistic.”<br><br>Promises of a better world beyond our own way of life, preying on masculine insecurities, and posting graphic online videos to terrify minorities?

I’ve got whiskey in the cellar. I got my hands on some nice (pre-Castro) Cuban cigars. Every day I turn on CNN to see another hysterical liberal crying and whining is like getting to open up another door in my advent calendar. And it’s only July.<br><br>But what did the Dems expect when they shoved white-hater extraordinaire Al Sharpton into the Oval Office? A guy who spent this summer calling over half the country racist? And then, when he finally gave a (fake) apology for his “indelicate words,” he clarified that he only meant over half of Congress because 100% of “good Americans” were with him.<br><br>Oh boy!<br><br>Let me remind you this is a guy who only won at all because his pet liberals at the New York Times and Washington Post were able to provide cover for him every time he said something stupid. Remember his (in)famous quote after Election Day:<br><br>“People have been saying I dragged down the Democrats because they won everywhere down ticket. If I did, <u>it’s only because there’s a segment of this country that is terrified to see a black man succeed</u>. They’ll cling to their guns and bigotries and hate people who aren’t like them to explain their failures in life.”<br><br>Wow. Just because you won’t vote for a man who has sparked more riots than Rodney King, you’re a racist! And a bigot! And a loser! To all the self-hating, Ivy League liberals out there: If you’re willing to vote for a guy who thinks you’re a racist, then more (white) power to you.<br><br>All these “bad vibes” (this is my attempt at Sharpton’s so-called youth outreach) might explain why he hasn’t gotten anything done, despite having a huge majority in his first two years and insiders like David Axelrod yammering in his ear about how to manage Congress. The Good Reverend refused to give an inch of his liberal credentials, refused to compromise on anything. Sure, it made the socialists like Bernie Sanders and Paul “Cry Baby” Wellstone happy, but it’s meant he’s got nada to campaign on this year. With the economy going down the toilet, he might have less than nada—if that’s possible. <br><br>No wonder his vice president Graham fled the scene at the Convention. I wouldn’t want to stand next to a fat, crooked loser like Sharpton myself. Hopefully they have his new running mate Turner on suicide watch.<br><br>But that’s only a small part of the overall picture. What he’s done for our troops over the last three years is absolutely inexcusable. His opposition to the war, while I believe it was misled, is completely fine. He underestimated our military and their ability to win in Iraq and Afghanistan--which they were clearly doing under Bush--but he’s not the only member of the Democrat Party like that. No, what sets him apart is him running his mouth off.<br><br>He said: “We have to accept we did wrong, and I don’t just mean Bush starting these wars. We have to have a conversation about how we pressured <u>our soldiers to become killers of innocent civilians in cold blood</u>.”<br><br>He went on to say that “this is why people hate us” and that “killing women and children is the fastest way to get attacked.”<br><br>Which AGAIN is just more blaming. AGAIN and AGAIN, Sharpton can’t find anything to do but blame other people for his failures. He waddles from place to place spewing hate and lies about the very people who are protecting our freedom. This is a man who doesn’t just dislike America, but DESPISES it. He wants to run this country into the ground and the Democrats let him. <br><br>They deserve to get buried and it looks like they will. <br><br>But I’ve said enough already. With the Loser-in-Chief’s approval near 34% (according to the pencilnecks at Gallup) and even the most hardcore liberal on MSNBC predicting a landslide loss against McCain, we’ll have order restored soon. I wish we had an actual conservative on the ticket but—hey—we can’t get everything on our Christmas lists can we?</p>`)

              <p>Tucker Carlson | <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>@tuckercarlsonmsnbc</u></span><br>April 13, 2007 at 10:49 AM<br><br>“His brain has not only been washed, as they say, it has been dry cleaned.” If you’ve ever watched the Angela Lansbury/Frank Sinatra classic The Manchurian Candidate, then the idea of a president secretly beholden to a foreign power is nothing new. It’s a common trope in fiction, and even some conspiracy theories. But I’m not talking about strange web forums or old movies. No, this is far more important. No matter what the liberal media thinks, we’ve reached a point where it is only fair to ask: is President Al Sharpton a Russian Manchurian Candidate?<br><br>It’s not a far-fetched question. When running for office, Sharpton excoriated President Bush’s freedom agenda, attacking our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, while alleging there was some mysterious group of “neocons” behind it all—whatever that even means. But after his stunning upset victory, I was willing to give Sharpton a shot. After all, revitalizing the economy at home and bringing the troops back from poorly executed foreign adventures couldn’t be all bad.<br><br>In office, however, Sharpton sounded a different tune. The president tried to slash vital CIA programs that provided a lifeline for the brave resistance fighters in Syria, battling a murderous dictatorship strongly supported by the Russians and Iranians. When old Soviet MIGs picked off the CIA’s top fighters like ants, Sharpton told Keith Olberman that these brave warriors were “linked to terrorists.” Putting the anti-Muslim rhetoric aside, it’s a line straight out of Russian propaganda, and I bet it made Vladimir Putin grin.<br><br><b>Read more:</b><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>The Republican Savior is in the House</u></span><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Are Syria's Chemical Weapons Iraq's Missing WMD? Start Asking the Real Questions</u></span><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Peace in Iran’s Time</u></span><br><br>Now, the president is being skewered across the political spectrum for this sweetheart deal he’s arranging between Putin and Assad. An end to all airstrikes and cutting off support for anti-regime fighters, in exchange for…what exactly? Some inscrutable gas pipeline arrangements in Eastern Europe and a removal of chemical weapons from Syria?<br><br>Now, all reasonable Americans can agree that it’s prudent for the commander-in-chief to think carefully before intervening around the world, and that a primary goal of any sensible foreign policy should be bringing our troops back home. But we can’t ignore how Sharpton set about doing this. Criticize the invasion of Iraq all you want, but Bush learned his lesson in Syria. As Commander-in-Chief, Bush authorized only limited aerial bombardment and stuck to backing proxies on the ground who were ready and willing to take the fight to a Russian puppet. What exactly is the problem with that?<br><br>So when Sharpton made all these bizarre decisions, a lot of self-proclaimed experts acted confused. They reasoned that he’s just a peace-nik, inexperienced, and naive. They’re dead wrong. Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Al Sharpton doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He’s selling out our own national security and playing into Putin’s hands. The president is a Russian asset, and the sooner we start dealing with the grave implications of that, the better. We’ve seen how badly the withdrawal from Iraq went. Don’t expect anything different from Syria, or Afghanistan. We could see tanks rumbling across NATO red lines any day now. Sharpton is Putin’s man in the White House.<br><br>As for that shock election upset in 2004, Republicans in Congress need to be asking some serious questions. Election watchers noticed strange discrepancies with voting machines—see my colleague Rachel Maddow’s <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>article about issues in Ohio</u></span>—and the few whistleblowers who have come forward have been silenced by the mainstream media. Few dare to ask the question, but let’s just lay it right out: did Vladimir Putin steal the 2004 election?</p>`)

              <p>MacroWest Solutions<br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>macrowest.com</u></span><br>January 28, 2007<br>Open letter to President Sharpton<br><br>Dear President Sharpton, <br><br>We are writing because we are concerned by the growing instability in the Indo-Pacific, and that if action is not immediately taken, our nation may soon face a threat in East Asia greater than any since the end of the Cold War. In your West Point speech on Iraq last month, the path you laid out toward a nuclear free Korean Peninsula was well-articulated, and we applaud the steps you have taken towards a withdrawal deadline in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet we are increasingly convinced that your administration should allocate those resources to Asia, rather than looking further inward.<br><br>The challenges at home require your close attention, but the best pathway to a prosperous middle class is through expanding our defense industrial base to meet the challenge in the Pacific. With this new Congress still negotiating your budget, we believe it would be prudent to increase expenditures for the U.S. Navy and Air Force, while trimming back spending on the Green Berets and other unnecessary special operations forces. With the hot wars in the Middle East and Central Asia winding down, these expenses become not only overbearing but detrimental to national security.<br><br>As you know, our Navy continues to shrink, with poorly planned post-Cold War cuts to our defense budget gutting the numbers of cruisers, destroyers, and even aircraft carriers. This is unconscionable in the face of the growing crises in the Indo-Pacific. To face future contingencies and ensure the United States remains dominant in great power competition, production of these forces must be accelerated. Furthermore, pitching these policy changes to a war-weary public will require emphasizing their domestic benefits. This will bring manufacturing back home, after years of offshoring jobs to our enemies. You can even say the Washington playbook has failed. After all, in the wake of a resurgent enemy in the East, it’s hard to argue that the previous administrations have taken this threat seriously.<br><br>We are living in a moment that will determine the fate of the world for generations to come. We must be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we ensured that American dominance will last beyond their lifetimes. We urge you to take decisive action. Leave every option on the table. This is a battle between the enlightened free world and backwater authoritarian enemies hellbent on imposing their vision across the planet. This is a war between the children of light and the children of darkness. To do anything less would be to ensure that the 21st century will be a Chinese Century.<br><br>Sincerely,<ul><li>Antony Blinken, foreign policy advisor to Senator J.R. Biden</li><li>Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution</li><li>Brett McGurk, former director for Iraq and the Coalition Provisional Authority, National Security Council</li><li>William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard</li><li>Michèle Flournoy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy</li><li>David Frum, former presidential speechwriter</li><li>Susan Rice, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs</li><li>Max Boot,  Jeane J.

Copy may not be in its final form.</i><br><br><b>AMY GOODMAN</b>: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.<br><br>Leaders from fifteen Latin American countries are meeting in Panama today with representatives of the Venezuelan government and the “Freedomista” guerillas in hopes of finding a resolution to the conflict that has destabilized the region. President Sharpton has sent a high-level delegation from the State Department to the conference and the White House issued a statement urging a “speed resolution” to the violence.<br><br>Reports from The Washington Post based on leaked Defense Department documents point to a massive covert operation led by the U.S. and with assistance from the Colombian Government to fund the Freedomistas in order to overthrow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Bush administration was already implicated in a coup attempt in 2002, using cutouts from the National Endowment of Democracy to back the Venezuelan opposition, including the coup plotters. President Chavez has been publicly warm to Sharpton, but it’s unclear whether the program has fully ended.<br><br>Joining us now from Portland, Oregon is James Sommer, who runs the blog <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>peakers.net</u></span>. James, you’ve covered this crisis in Venezuela in-depth on your website. What motives do you see behind this alleged covert program? And is there a real chance for peace?<br><br><b>JAMES SOMMER</b>: Look, Amy, we’ve gotta be real clear about this. The Bush clan were completely addicted to oil, and the Cheney cabal, whatever you want to call them, they knew that we were running out fast. You know? That’s why they went into Iraq, not just for all of Saddam’s gold—which you guys never talk about—but the oil, we all know that, and also Afghanistan, you see? They were trying to sway the Taliban with a pipeline deal and they wouldn’t agree, so then you get this manufactured “terror threat” and some group called All Kayda that doesn’t even exist and all these warnings but it’s all just an excuse for oil, and now we’re seeing the same in Venezuela, where they’re trying to kill Hugo Chavez, Amy. That’s all real.<br><br><b>AMY GOODMAN</b>: Ok, thanks very much, we’re going to end the interview there. Our next guest is Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who is one of the participants involved in negotiations to end this conflict. Live from Panama City, can you hear us, Mr. President?<br><br><b>MANUEL ZELAYA</b>: [translated] Thank you very much, Amy, yes I can hear you clearly.<br><br><b>AMY GOODMAN</b>: Excellent. President Zelaya, I wanted to ask you about these guerillas inside Venezuela, and the allegations that the U.S. is behind it. Do you see this support as something that’s still ongoing? <br><br><b>MANUEL ZELAYA</b>: [translated] Absolutely. Yes. Yes, it is still going on. But you can’t forget that it is about more than just the violence, it’s about regional domination. That’s where this colonialist idea of the “backyard” comes from. And the North Americans have other ways of doing this. You saw what happened in my country, in Honduras, in the 1980’s. As the CIA was supporting the contras in Nicaragua and the—the death squads in El Salvador, they were dominating my country using the financial method.<br><br><b>AMY GOODMAN</b>: Sorry, Mr. President, the feed is a little spotty. Can you expand more on that financial method you were talking about?<br><br><b>MANUEL ZELAYA</b>: [translated] Of course. Just look at the World Bank. When they came into our country—and not just my country, but all over Latin America—they brought wages down, destroyed all state-owned industry, and expanded all of the countries for exploitation by foreign investment—which just meant the North Americans. So you see the same things happening today, we saw this in Argentina with President Kirchner resisting their plans for domination. But now you have to take a look at who’s the head of the World Bank right now—<br><br><b>AMY GOODMAN</b>: Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.<br><br><b>MANUEL ZELAYA</b>: [translated] Exactly. So it’s really just the same thing, no matter who is in power. But excuse me, I have to leave the broadcast now, I have a meeting with President López Obrador to get to.</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>The COINdinistas</h3>
              <p>23 Nov. 2005<br><br>President Wellstone’s White House is brimming with ideological zealots. No, not the old New Lefties turned liberals trying to push an expansive healthcare bill through an unwilling Congress. Not the protectionist warriors picking up the sword of Ross Perot to cut free trade agreements to ribbons. And certainly not the neocons of the Bush days, who leaned on the president to always intervene militarily, with mixed results.<br><br>No, the zealots of the Wellstone administration are the COINdinistas. It may seem odd that military theorists pushing a counterinsurgency doctrine have been so well-received in the White House. After all, the president was elected on a staunchly anti-war platform, promising a quick withdrawal in Afghanistan and large defense cuts. But the latter are negotiable to these COINdinistas. In fact they’re eager to slash Cold War era programs better suited to fight a peer competitor like Russia or China. These warriors are far more concerned with the hearts and minds of a targeted populace. Their hero is Edward Lansdale, not MacArthur. To them, wars must be fought with extensive psychological warfare operations, an understanding of the country’s culture, and limited ground troops. <br><br>The COINdinistas’ undisputed leader is David Petraeus, a career Army officer whose dizzying rise has ruffled feathers in the Pentagon—he was just promoted to General three weeks ago—but has had an unusually close relationship with President Wellstone. The Sixties radical and the General may be an unlikely pairing, but it’s what I’m told is the “dominant” dynamic in the West Wing. “Petraeus leans on Wellstone so hard, he’s fallen over,” one longtime Wellstone aide grumbled. <br><br>Now, it appears the president’s withdrawal plans have been significantly modified. Tens of thousands of troops are coming home from Afghanistan, that’s not in dispute. But the counterinsurgency tactics used against the Taliban with shocking effectiveness will be ramped up. Some inside the Pentagon question whether they can even work. “It’s all about this ‘limited war’ or ‘low-intensity conflict’ bullshit,” one former General ranted. “The truth is they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing. We had the same rodeo in El Salvador, and all it did was kill a lot of people, it didn’t beat any guerillas.”<br><br>These counterinsurgency warriors’ somewhat ironic nickname evokes a humiliating defeat for the concept of low-intensity warfare. The Nicaraguan Sandinistas infuriated the Reagan administration, prompting a massive CIA campaign to aid the Contras, which blew up in the president’s face. The Sandinistas were ultimately defeated, but after Reagan left office, and in a presidential election, not on the battlefield.<br><br>Stories of U.S. jets dropping bombs on the wrong targets, accidentally killing Afghan civilians, have garnered headlines in recent months. The recent bombing of a hospital in the northern province of Kunduz was covered as an exception, but in reality such carelessness is routine. In the COINdinista theory, this is the unwieldy hammer to the far more effective scalpel. In President Wellstone’s recent Pentagon budget request, the overall sum was about 5% lower than where his predecessor left it. But there has been a massive 400% increase in funds to the Army’s storied special-operations forces. As one senior administration official told me, “it’s not like we’re doubling down on Afghanistan. We’re not sending 40,000 troops like those Pentagon assholes kept telling us to.” But when I asked about the prospect of full withdrawal, he was testy, “look, that was never going to happen with Congress as it is, and all of the president’s agenda in the air.”<br><br>Making compromises in Washington is nothing new, but with Wellstone’s ambitious domestic agenda getting off to a slow start, those that may pay the price will be Afghans thousands of miles away</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>WELLSTONE AT WAR: Potus lashes out at Blair, privately calls him ‘MORON’ over Dodgy Dossier disaster</h3>
          <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>dailymail.co.uk</u></span><br>PUBLISHED: 17:59 EDT, 7 January 2006<br><br>Paul Wellstone is even more critical of Tony Blair in private than he is in public. To close aides, Mr Wellstone has called the PM a ‘moron’ and blasted his relationship with former President George Bush as ‘a love session,’ it has been revealed. <br><br>The American president’s frosty relationship with Downing Street is well-known, but recent reports published in The Washington Post paint a picture of a president at war, not with Saddam Hussein or Murmur Gadhafy, but with the British public. Inside the Oval Office, Mr Wellstone has called the British press “atrocious” for publishing stories about Saddam’s support for terrorism before the Iraq War. This is in addition to the hot water Mr Wellstone is already in over comments he made in December about the British Armed Forces.<br><br>When Mr Wellstone was asked at a press conference with Mr Blair last month what he would say to young Britons considering serving their country, he shamed them. “Well it’s a great honour, certainly, but I’d uh, I would hope young British—not just British, but also young Americans can see that a career in, you know, medicine or…or caring for the elderly is just as honourable.”<br><br>Reports in the Mirror the morning after said Mr Blair was ‘FURIOUS’ with the response, castigating Mr Wellstone after the conference ended to his face, telling him he ‘appreciated his candor’ but that it ‘could have been delivered a bit better.’<br><br>If the reports from Washington are true, what the Americans are saying about our PM is far worse than anything that’s been said about Mr Wellstone publicly here. Behind closed doors, however, Mr Blair too is dismissive of the president’s ambitious health and social security agenda. <br><br>‘The money for those pensions doesn’t just grow on trees,’ he reportedly told aides. Another close advisor agreed that Mr Wellstone’s plan to increase payments for social security would come at an awkward time for Labour, with Blair’s record with pensions a sore spot for the party. ‘‘It would set a bad precedent.’<br><br>But the feud between the Americans and Mr Blair is rawest in regards to the ‘dodgy dossier’ and the alleged ‘Downing Street memo’ released on the internet last April. Wellstone has called the dossier briefing to British journalists over Saddam’s missile threat to the UK ‘a poorly-made hoax’ that ‘even my dog wouldn’t fall for.’ <br><br>He has also given oxygen to the uproar over the minutes of a July 2003 meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Blair. In the document, Richard Dearlove, then head of MI6, stated “the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy” and that Bush had “made up his mind” over invading Iraq. Wellstone has fumed to aides that this is ‘almost treason’ and reportedly even entertained notions that former Vice President Dick Cheney should be charged for war crimes.<br><br>But despite these private viewpoints, the American president has been conspicuously silent in public on the matter. Asked about the memo after its release last year, appearing visibly frustrated, Wellstone said “we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards” on the Bush administration. <br><br>Tags: Tony Blair, Iraq, Paul Wellstone, Downing Street, Minnesota<br><br><b>TOP STORIES</b><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>UH-OH!

              <p>Red Lines<br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>newyorker.com/magazine</u></span><br>Annals of National Security May 5, 2007 Issue<br>By Seymour M. Hersh<br>April 23, 2007<br><br>MUDDYING THE WATERS<br><br>Since taking office, after his predecessor’s last few potshots at Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, President Wellstone’s strategy in the third American war in so many years has confounded experts. The White House immediately ceased all U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while still pledging to “keep the option on the table,” without specifying what action would trigger further intervention. Meanwhile, the chaos since October 2004 has consumed the country, spiraling into a destructive civil war and destabilizing the greater region. President Wellstone and his advisors tell the press they remain committed to seeing Assad leave power, but are mum on how they plan to get there.<br><br>Further complicating matters, Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to strengthen one of the last old Soviet client regimes in the Middle East, but likewise has refused to specify how he plans to do it. The European press is filled with sightings of Spetsnaz special forces spotted in the suburbs of Damascus and freighters filled with old Soviet weapons bound for Syria halted before they leave Croatia.<br><br>More from The New Yorker:<br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>“We Know that They Know that We Know:” Adam Curtis’ new feature on healthcare, the Middle East, and the dot com bubble</u></span><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>The Cell that Struck London | Steve Coll</u></span><br><br>When pressed on the matter, President Putin has demurred, suggesting that any overt U.S. military role in Syria would trigger a sharp Russian reaction. President Wellstone has also refused to set a firm red line, with his answer changing practically week-to-week. At his infamous press conference in May 2005, Wellstone mentioned “seeing a lot of chemical weapons” as a condition in which he would launch a deeper intervention. The White House quickly walked that comment back, but National Security Advisor James Steinberg said the next month that the administration’s red line was the fall of rebel-held Aleppo (this past week marked the second year of the Syrian government’s siege on the northern city).<br><br>Finally, Wellstone appears to have settled on a rough red line. According to three senior administration officials, the president will fully commit the U.S. to a full-scale military intervention in Syria if the Russians intervene first. “The hope is that it’s a MAD thing,” one top State Department appointee told me. “Like if they’re not going in if we don’t go in, then we won’t go in if they don’t go in.”<br><br>Such tenuous agreements appear to be holding for now, yet what goes unremarked upon often in Washington is that both the U.S. and Russia have already fully committed to a “military solution” in Syria. It’s covert only to the public, but in the halls of power, these decisions are well-known. As has been referenced in the mainstream papers on occasion, the CIA has been carrying out a large covert action program to arm the rebels, in liaison with Saudi intelligence, to the tune of at least $1 billion per year. The FSB too has spent a fortune funneling surplus Soviet stock weapons to Assad and his allies in Hezbollah, with one classified Pentagon analysis calculating its cost at over $2 billion since 2005 alone.<br><br>THE CROATIAN CONNECTION<br><br>In a report from The New York Times last December, the source of the CIA’s guns for the Syrian rebels was revealed: a port in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Assets on the ground move the weapons (including advanced BGM-1 TOW missiles) on to large freighters owned by CIA cutouts, which then set sail for Lebanon, where they’re smuggled over the border with Syria. <br><br>Where do the Russians send their weapons from? The same Dubrovnik port. <br><br>“It’s Looney Toons shit,” one agency veteran with ongoing contacts inside the CIA remarked. “I mean the Cold War days were pretty nuts, but this is something else.” Two sources told me they’ve heard unconfirmed reports that some of the CIA’s guns for the rebels and FSB’s guns for pro-regime forces even traveled on the same ships. <br><br>When I asked administration officials whether the U.S. covertly backing one side in a civil war against an opposing side supported by Russia amounted to a proxy war, they laughed it off. “I mean sure, if that’s what you want to call it,” a White House source remarked.<br><br>The CIA itself is reportedly deeply frustrated by the whole affair, even as President Wellstone still wavers on when and how he will send the US military into Syria. A top Middle Eastern intelligence expert aware of the operations chuckled, “it’s all politics.” Many inside the CIA are equally cynical. “If he wants to have a working relationship with Putin and not put his nuts in a twist with all the NATO bullshit on Georgia and Ukraine, fine. And if he wants to get involved in the civil war directly, alright. But Christ, does he have to do both at the same time?” ♦<br><br><i>Published in the print edition of the May 5, 2007, issue.</i><br><br><i>Seymour M.

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>inthesetimes.com</u></span><br>Chris Hines | September 4, 2005<br><br>If you were to turn on cable news lately, you would think President Wellstone just sold not only New Orleans, but our entire country, off to Latin American communists. In Chris Matthew’s now legendarily bizarre rant on MSNBC, he speculated that he would be executed in Central Park in the coming months. In a slightly less hysterical reaction, a New York Times editorial’s headline read: “THE END OF THE AMERICAN WAY.” Texas Congressman Michael Burgess has loudly called for the president to be tried for treason. <br><br>All because Wellstone accepted a little help from Cuban doctors to manage the ongoing disaster in New Orleans. After the levees broke, the city was almost completely underwater. The finger-pointing was immediate, but the top priority was to rescue as many people as possible. Of course, Wellstone was in Santiago when the storm reached land, still trying to resolve at least one of three spectacularly failed foreign wars handed to him by his predecessor. The CIA’s Colombian paramilitary proxies and their vicious campaign of terror to topple Hugo Chavez’s leftist government in Venezuela will go down as one of the biggest covert action blunders of the century. <br><br>Naturally, Wellstone sought to mitigate the nightmare he had left over, and convened a regional peace summit to negotiate some sort of solution to the crisis. Then, in a now infamous impromptu sidebar chat with Fidel Castro, Wellstone spontaneously agreed to the Cuban leader’s offer to send medical relief and as many as 1,600 medics. Apparently thawing ancient Cold War tensions, alleviating suffering in New Orleans, and expanding foreign assistance programs is tantamount to shipping our country off to China now. <br><br>Perhaps, after the last four years, our pundit class has forgotten what diplomacy looks like. If so, I can’t blame them. After all, if Bush were still in office, he would have invaded Cuba, sent mercenaries to shoot drowning victims in New Orleans, and landed on the roof of a submerged home to raise a “Mission Accomplished” banner. As for Wellstone, if this is a sign of how he can weather the storm, then just tune off the noise, because I think there’s smooth sailing ahead.<br></p>`)

            <p>By Lou Dobbs<br>CNN<br><br>Thursday, February 3, 2008<br><br>WASHINGTON (CNN) — Amid a slowing economy and a parade of congressional investigations, President John Edwards used his State of the Union address Monday night to champion recent bipartisan foreign policy initiatives spearheaded by the White House.<br><br>For informed political observers, the Address offered little new. Edwards did not address the personal and professional scandals that have plagued his administration nor did he reveal any new approach to the health care reform bill currently trapped in committee. Prior to the address, senior aides had sought to downplay expectations. Acting Chief of Staff Andrew Young said last week that it “was not necessary” to announce any new programs when Congress had yet to act on the “most ambitious domestic agenda since FDR.”<br><br>Instead, Edwards celebrated what he described as the “New Consensus for a New Century,” a collection of policies meant to advance and preserve America’s place in a rapidly changing world.<br><br>“What the New Consensus offers is not hard power, not soft power, but smart power. With evidence-based and mission-driven policies, crafted by our nation’s foremost experts, the world once again feels the full weight of America’s moral leadership.”<br><br>With specific call-outs that at times made him resemble an award show host more than an officer of the United States, Edwards highlighted contributions to the “New Consensus” from Senators Richard Lugar (R-IN), John McCain (R-AZ) Joe Biden (D-DE), and Hillary Clinton (D-NY). <br><br>These successes included Edwards’s signature “Marshall Corps” of peacebuilding experts to help failing states, funded by private-sector contributions and cuts to his predecessor’s “wasteful and bloated” PEPFAR program. They also included the 4 billion-dollar military operation “Good Intention” to train the militaries of Central Africa and assist in the capture of Joseph Kony of the Lord's Resistance Army.<br><br>Edwards celebrated the successes of the group “Invisible Children” whose leaders Jason Russell and Laren Poole attended as guests and the “passion of American youth to serve as leaders for the world.”<br><br>“My Administration will continue to look to new voices, soliciting input from our new public square—the World Wide Web. Sites like www.kony2008.com play a critical role in setting the tone of our new national discourse.”<br><br><br>Don’t Miss</br><br>* Videos: The full speech, key clips and reactions<br>* Republicans respond to Edwards address<br>* Disruption from gay activist sparks outrage<br>* Opinion: Deciphering First Lady Elizabeth Edwards’ No-Show<br>* McCain expands fundraising lead with post-Address online appeal<br><br>Describing Africa as a “new land of opportunity,” the president declared that he would continue his work to “seed American ideas and values” across the continent through a raft of policies to support corporate investments across the continent and new efforts to train and supply Africa’s militaries.<br><br>Edwards also championed the creation of AFRICOM, highlighting its potential to “promote peace and strengthen US security cooperation with a continent that is rapidly emerging as the battlefield in the new war of ideas.”<br><br>Aside from a disruption from an activist late in the evening after the announcement of further cuts to PEPFAR, the speech was well-received by Washington’s leaders. It remains to be seen whether Edwards’s so-called “Pivot to Africa” will be enough to save his Administration from its myriad scandals as it enters an election year.<br></p>`)

According to several exclusive sources, it looks like President Edwards might be once again playing the field. <br><br>For all of you not in the political know, things for President Edwards have been fraying faster than Hillary’s split ends ever since First Lady Liz Edwards passed away in ‘06. It’s not just the nasty NAFTA bill tanking (Yikes!) or the fashion faux pas with Harper (talk about a slow shuffle!), but tons of mistakes that have made most Americans want to say Farewell to the Chief.<br><br>In June, we published rumors that President Johnny was spotted snuggling up to a woman at a Nebraska rally. Now, it may just get worse. We now have EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS of the pair strolling hand in hand through the Bundestag gardens after some G7 pow-wow. <br><br>Talk about Putin the right foot forward! Is this the Commander-in-Chief scoring some poon, or just taking a stroll in the park? Your guess is as good as ours.<br><br>Whether real or not, these BOMBSHELL allegations could straight-up bulldoze Edwards' campaign. That sympathy wave he caught after First Lady Edwards' passing? Poof, gone. Mike Huckabee, the Crazy Homophobic Presumptive Republican nominee, released a statement when these stories first emerged. In a speech earlier this month, he said:<br><br><blockquote>"The American people deserve transparency and honesty. If there's any truth to these allegations, it's a grave disservice to the public."</blockquote><br><br>This is just the latest in a string of total flops that have stalked the President, a huge problem when Johnny never seems like he’s telling the truth! Just last week, Jimmy Kimmel compared him to Huey Lewis-loving Patrick Bateman, killing primary challenger Mike Gravel with a fire ax. Yeowch! <br><br>Edwards is taking an absolute shellacking in the polls, with 57% of Americans giving his tenure a big thumbs down. He's slipping behind candidates like Huckabee, Tancredo, and Perry, all of whom have jumped onto these reports while John continues to avoid mentioning it. <br><br>For the sake of all our gays out there, let’s PRAY that Edwards is able to work off a PR miracle before the election.

            <p><u><b>Previous Entry</u></b> | <u><b>Next Entry</u><br></b>November 1, 2008 at 1:14 PM<br><br>It’s November, which means we’re in the middle of that age-old tradition where the American people go through the motions of choosing a candidate of someone else’s choosing. In the age of the internet, this solemn tradition has been augmented with flame wars, epithets, and trolling. There’s been high moments (still rofling at whoever wore their fursuit to meet Tipper Gore) and low (just take a look at some of the cringey Republican outreach on TheFacebook).<br><br>Today, I want to focus on one of the highest highs, a moment that shows the kinds of creativity and community that’s possible on the World Wide Web. I want to talk about the #thompsondeathrally.<br><br>If you missed it, #thompsondeathrally was a meme on Twitter, a web blog site that launched about two years ago where you can only post up to <u><i>140</u></i> characters. When it launched, most of the users were people in tech and there were only sporadic posts, but membership has surged over the election to 1.5+ million users and almost 5 million messages a day. It’s crazy growth in the middle of a recession and one of the things that contributed to this rise was #thompsondeathrally.<br><br>If you <u><b>do a search on Twitter for #thompsondeathrally</u></b>, you’ll find some of the best group fiction ever. The posts tell a strange, disjointed account of a political rally straight out of H.P. Lovecraft, with bizarre rites taking place on stage to rescue Fred Thompson’s flailing campaign.<blockquote><b>GreenDamien</b> @thegreenster</blockquote><blockquote>Fred Thompson opens with a shoutout to his “Fred Heads.” He then reveals what appears to be the severed head of Ronald Reagan. It begins to scream. #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote><blockquote><b>David Daniels</b> @ddaniels213</blockquote><blockquote>“No child left behind!” Campaign volunteers separate a mother from her children. They’re dragging them to the stage. I see the glint of a knife. #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote><blockquote><b>Aubrey Lee</b> @swordnstoner</blockquote><blockquote>Thompson-Frist, Frist-Thompson. Nominee and running mate merge as one. This is the only way to assure party unity, they say with two mouths. </blockquote><blockquote>#ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote><blockquote><b>adam t</b> @athomthompson</blockquote><blockquote>“Life begins at implantation.” The masses shriek with delight as Thompson vomits another glistening egg into a woman’s open mouth. #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote>The hash tag went on for <i>days</i> as the Internet hive-mind put together a communal vision of a nightmarish rally.<blockquote><b>Obama 2012</b> @georgeyjordans3</blockquote><blockquote>“We will re-privatize health care. We will re-privatize sanity. We will re-privatize God.” #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote><blockquote><b>Candy Morgennthau</b> @camorgenn</blockquote><blockquote>Bush flails as they lay him out on the altar. His father is brought out after him. No more tolerance for failure. #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote><blockquote><b>Problem Sleuth</b> @mspafan</blockquote><blockquote>#thompsondeathrally staffers keep saying we need to stop the troop withdrawal, finish the job. It’s a chant. The moon turns blood-red.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Suzanne Wallace</b> @suzieqwallacee</blockquote><blockquote>A sting on my arm. When I look down, a locust with Oliver North’s face is gorging messily on my flesh. I understand now. #thompsondeathrally</blockquote>Even I got in on the action.<blockquote><b>Laurie Childs</b> @deathcabbkitty</blockquote><blockquote>Mike Huckabee stands inside an effigy made to resemble the Green Cities Act. With a wide smile, he lights a match. #ThompsonDeathRally</blockquote>Eventually some reporters took notice. The Chicago Tribune published a bemused article titled, <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>“Internet Geeks Imagine Thompson Using ‘Satanic Powers’</span></u> (describing Lovecraft as Satanic makes me wince but we). The weirdos at Breitbart, meanwhile, published something with the title, “<span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Twitter Users Threaten Thompson, Republicans.</span></u>” Losers.<br><br>Like a lot of memes, this whole thing started small, not as a set of “death threats” against Fred Thompson (as much as I’m sure he would love the attention. According to data nerd Nate Silver, <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>he’s polling in the mid-40s in must-win states</span></u>). It started because he held a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Then it started to get cold and, for whatever reason, his security refused to let people leave. After the fact, they told people it was because of “security” (though I think we all know it’s because he didn’t want the cameras seeing him talking to no one).<br><br> The whole thing is a PR own-goal from Thompson, sparked by staffers doing something really stupid and reporters being bored by a dull election. As much as I’m sure Thompson and Hilldawg would love Gore to lose (did you see her complaining about Gore going “far left” ever since he grew that beard lawl), I don’t think it’s going to happen unless they really do summon Cthulhu.<br><br>Anyways, I’d encourage you to register a Twitter account and see the rest of the posts yourself. I’ll return to my usual Harry Potter posting once this election is over. Until then, enjoy!</p>`)

              <p>By Joe Roberts | 1:14 PM on October 23, 2006<br><i>The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RealAmericans.com.</i><br><br>Folks, it’s worse than we thought. By now, my fellow Americans, I’m sure you’ve all seen President <s>Bore</s> Gore give his Oval Office address on the war. Casualties are higher this year than ever before, IED attacks have spiked 300% in the past 6 months, and we’re losing the Battle of Lashkargah. What’s the president’s strategy to deal with this disaster? Solar panels! No, we’re not kidding.<br><br>As part of the White House’s “New Look” strategy in Afghanistan, we’ll have 95% of our troops out by the end of 2007, turning things over to the Afghans. Right now, we’re building up their defenses and implementing civil service programs. At least, that’s what the liberal media has led us to believe.<br><br>But according to some top secret documents that have fallen into my hands, I can reveal where at least $2 million of <i>your</i> tax dollars are going to in Afghanistan. In what the State Department calls an “environmental reform initiative,” they’re sinking cash into “renewable energy programs,” i.e. solar panels and wind farms. <br><br>Is Gore <i>trying</i> to lose re-election? Forget fighting the Taliban terrorists targeting our own troops, he’s more worried about making Afghans eat kale. Now, these leaked documents I’ve obtained are huge, and what we’ve published here is just a fraction of what I’ve got. But it’s the most important part. Nothing else comes close. There’s a boring 100 page section dedicated to allegations of child rape against some warlords the CIA is giving $50 million to, which is something straight out of Taliban propaganda. There’s also some material about so-called “internal investigations” into US airstrikes that have allegedly killed “thousands of civilians.” Yeah buddy, I’m sure. Straight out of the Viet Cong playbook.<br><br>There’s more about drug trafficking and opium fields we’re supposed to be protecting, but look folks, I’m no expert on this. What I <i>am</i> an expert on is knowing when the American people are being ROBBED BLIND by a WHINER IN CHIEF who’s going to get OBLITERATED in the midterms this November.

In Iraq, the most determinative point will be the next six months. In Afghanistan, we’re rounding the corner. But we can’t lose sight of what’s further down the tunnel. A resurgent China and Russia in Eurasia is an existential threat to the post-World War II international order, and by extension the United States itself. We’ve seen the Communist Chinese threaten to encircle Taiwan, no doubt emboldened by our Navy’s brutal losses in the Persian Gulf. <br><br>Additionally, as Douglas MacArthur once said, any general who wants to fight a land war in Asia—or I think it was East Asia—has got to get their head checked. He’s right. We need to be frank: the Army is not up for a fight with the Chinese. So what are we left with? The cold hard fact is that our nuclear arsenal is our best weapon. The nuclear option can no longer be considered a “last line of defense,” in any war to liberate East Asia. It is <i>our only option</i> to spread democracy to that darkened corner of the globe.<br><br>[APPLAUSE]<br><br><b>PERLE</b>: Thank you. I want to finish with a toast to Mr. Robert Kagan, who was recently appointed by President Gore to a senior post at the State Department.

If they expand all the way to Mosul (see Gen. Clark’s 1/04 memo), they would control more territory than any other Islamist terrorist group in the world. The current largest would be the Taliban in AfPak, despite the surge. <br><br>There’s no appetite for regime change in Syria left in Washington, despite whatever press sec says every day. Obviously POTUS has been distraught seeing some of the arms he greenlit for rebels wind up in the hands of militants blowing up sacred sites. Rs will certainly seize on this and other perceived foreign policy failures (Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon crisis) in upcoming elections.<br><br>Just top of my head, but I think there’s a clear solution for a lot of the chaos: blame it on Qaddafi. Up until ‘03 re: Iraq invasion and Gaddahfi handed over WMD program, he was enemy no. 1 (remember Lockerbie?). But after his turnaround with Blair, we’ve made steps towards normalization. I’ve been hearing from some contacts with UN inspectors that Qadafi is still pursuing WMD program though, I’ll forward you those memos at later date. <br><br>Still, Qadafy is known to fund terrorist groups all over the world (IRA, Fatah), so why not say he’s behind most of chaos in Syria? Why not pin the disasters in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, and Somalia on him too? He’s funding these groups everywhere, it wouldn’t be hard to string some intelligence together. If we say Gaddafi is behind it all, it would take some heat off the president. Maybe if we’re lucky he can pivot to a real clean break. Just one quick war to put the mad dog down, and use it as a launching pad to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan while leaving Syria behind?

              <p><b>Eagle Forum Newsletter | August 25, 2008</b><br><br>Our economic problems are not just because of the China issue. While, indeed, they’ve been raking in billions of dollars thanks to Gore’s support of Climate Change Cash Grabs and government policies that encourage well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs to move overseas, much of what we see today has been the result of our own would-be Stalins and Trotskys. <br><br>The collapsing stock market? A symptom of socialistic speculators sure of a government safety net. Rising unemployment? A result of our centrally mismanaged economy run by McKinsey kiddos. Skyrocketing oil prices and a sub-prime mortgage collapse? Well, we have no one to thank for that except our wannabe despot, our go-it-alone globalist, George W. Bush.<br><br>For the past eight years, Americans have been forced to put up with all manner of socialistic chicanery—whether it be three senseless, draining wars, the failed bail-outs of Bear Stearns, AIG, and Morgan Stanley, or the more recent foolish, bureaucrat-led attempts to force incandescent light bulbs out of the home. <br><br>At a time when U.S. coffers were already running dry and the national mood was at an all-time low, Gore and his band of communists gave a half-billion dollars to AstroPower to subsidize making solar panels, yet the company promptly went bankrupt. Then Gore awarded a quarter of a million—tacked on to the yearly budget like an ornament on a Christmas tree—to a little-known firm called Tesla Motors to make batteries for its electric cars, only for that company to go bankrupt too. It is now trying to pay off its investors by auctioning the company.<br><br>The two highest bidders in an auction earlier this year were the Soros-owned Lehman Brothers and the Wanxiang Group, which has close ties to Communist China’s government through its CEO, a prominent figure in the Chinese Community Party.<br><br>What these developments demonstrate is a systematic plot to weaken America, to drain Fort Knox with expensive wars and senseless programs and then sell off the proceeds for pennies on the dollar to our ideological adversaries. In China’s hands, this new Tesla Motors technology could threaten U.S. electrical power and be used to sabotage our grid. <br><br>Of course, the liberal New York Times calls on us not to overreact, to not turn away from the “internationalization” of the last two presidents with “isolationism” (a term that speaks of their elitist disdain for everyday Americans suffering under senseless trade deals, pacts, and treaties). They call us to swallow the bail-outs and the hand-outs pushed through by Gore’s Kamarck-Klain Klan, bills made possible by a web of deception about the strength of our private enterprise system (which has never been the cause of job loss). <br><br>These same deceptions seek to hide the drain of the millions of illegals and asylum seekers now burdening our welfare systems—another gift courtesy of the Bush-Gore duopoly. Sooner or later, these parasites will wind up doing more than just growing our debt, they’ll seek to avenge their homelands using the same tactics that Usama Bin Laden tried in the 1990s. We’ve already seen repeated attacks on American embassies in the Middle East and Europe.<br><br>Luckily, Americans seem to be waking up to the catastrophe inflicted on them by the country’s socialistic elites. Al Gore is not running for president, a decision undoubtedly motivated by his low approval ratings, and instead throwing his support behind the gaffer-in-chief Vice President Biden. It is obvious that Gore hopes to exploit Biden’s good relationship with Congress and his running mate Barack Hussein Obama’s popularity with the radical left to preserve Democrat control of the government.<br><br>On the Republican side, real conservatives have finally prevailed. After a near-decade-long occupation, the party cast out the Bush Crime Family and their Trotskyist supporters Rummy, Cheney, and Powell. They rejected the “McCain Lite” Jon Huntsman and Bush Lackey Zell Miller. They have finally embraced a true conservative who is ready to fight against socialist excess, who is committed to removing us from these foreign wars, a proven leader who will shut down our borders until we overcome our current crises—The Apprentice himself, Donald J. Trump<br><br>While you all know I have been a supporter of Trump’s since Day One and have been providing him with my decades of political wisdom through this historic run, I hope you will join us on this journey to restore our country to greatness. With your help, we can end the America Last foreign policy of the last generation and bring about a domestic agenda that helps real, hard-working American families.<br><br><b>Further Reading:</b><br><b>AVAILABLE NOW: Faithfully Phyllis In the Kitchen: Purchase $15, 10% of proceeds go to the Tancredo for America Fund!</b></p>`)

              <p>by Jeffrey Lawson | Daily Kos staff writer<br>Tue Nov 07, 2006 at 11:08:04 AM PDT<br><br>Yikes. The polls haven’t even closed yet and Republicans are already talking about shutting down the government if they take over the House:<br><br>Rep. Phil English: Gore might ‘force’ House to shut down government<br><br>A top House Republican today told reporters that President Gore might try to “force a shutdown” to harm Republicans.<br><br>Rep. Phil English said that with “a ballooning deficit, slowing economic conditions, and an intransigent and unreasonable president,” Republicans should be ready to “put on a brave face” come time for budget negotiations.<br><br>“I think, given his history, he’ll veto any budget bill we pass to him and then the hard vote will be, when he forces us to vote on them again, whether we will have to deal with another situation where we might need to shut down the government. It’s not something that anyone wants but, if we want people to know we have principles, we have to be brave,” explained English on Fox Business.<br><br>Okay, first of all, the election isn’t even over yet, asshat. Polls remain open and it’s not like the Hastert sex crime bullshit is winning over a lot of people actually paying attention this election. If you go over to NYT (“Four Possible Outcomes for This Year’s Midterms”), you’ll see that Democrats still have a chance to hang onto their seats in the South if they can turn out enough young voters.<br><br>Second of all, even if Republicans do somehow take control, the House doesn’t even fucking send spending bills to the president. That’s the Senate. If the Republicans take over the House it’s just one chamber and they’ll still have to contend with the other. That’s what having a bicameral legislature means. This scenario that English is thinking up would require Republicans to take over the Senate too, which is something that everyone thinks is absolute fantasy. The chamber that only narrowly defeated a climate treaty isn’t going to flip. <br><br>Third, even if they do somehow manage to take both chambers and they do send a spending bill to Gore that is so egregious (e.g. ending the climate programs, trying to reverse the Iraq and Afghanistan pullout, forcing him to cut spending again to balance the budget) that he can’t sign it, that won’t cause the government to shut down. Congress can still pass a continuing resolution to keep last year’s spending levels without an agreement with the president. At that point, it’s just Congress’s fault. <br><br>What all this means in the end is that the Republicans are engaging in political terrorism. They’re trying to frighten voters into giving them the solutions they want, to sabotage the peace-building efforts that Gore has been pursuing to end Bush’s disastrous wars. It’s just like when they leaked those stories about Usama “planning attacks” to terrify people into thinking they made a mistake in tossing out Bush. They’re getting together and doing what they can to ensure this country fails so they can blame Gore. They can't pass the buck on their failed agenda. It’s time for them to "man up" and take responsibility for their actions. <br><br>Discuss (119 comments)</p>`)

The president is exactly right to remind the people of America that we won the war; that we’ve liberated a people with minimal casualties (the incident at the Italian consulate notwithstanding); that we are right to remain ever vigilant in an ever-more insecure age. I deeply admire Hillary for going out there and taking responsibility for the entire thing. Listening to her talk about building the “pillars of democracy” to liberate “an entire generation of women” gave me goosebumps. <br><br>But I do think Jonathan Alter in The Atlantic has a point that the whole set-up, the backdrop, the sign gives off a certain—how do I say this?—neediness. It’s one thing to give a speech commemorating the liberation of a country and another thing entirely to do so on America’s biggest aircraft carrier, off the coast of Tripoli, surrounded by flags and cheering men in uniform. Our soldiers deserve to be seen and recognized, but I fear critics will read the entire ceremony as revealing of a deep insecurity. Like the president needs to convince America they did the right thing—and that’s not right.<br><br>And anyone notice how little WMDs came up in the speech? What’s up with that?<br><br><b>12.48 AM</b><br><br><b>Wednesday, June 6, 2007</b><br><br>After the invasion of Libya, there was chaos. These things are unavoidable in wars. Even The Aeneid, there’s descriptions of anarchy that will be all too familiar to the late-night television viewer. Consider:<br><br>The ancient city fell that had for many years<br>Been queen. Corpses lay piled everywhere,<br>In the streets, the houses, the hallowed thresholds<br>Of the temples. And it was not only the Trojans<br>Who paid in blood. <br><br>In the aftermath of President Clinton’s speech, I’ve been going back and forth over Stanley Lombardo’s new translation of The Aeneid to steel myself. As CNN broadcasts new videos of the air strikes on Benghazi—far more devastating than anyone thought—I have to remind myself that these things have always happened. <br><br>I know that Clinton and Clark are juggling a lot of competing interests and they have to put a bright face forward, but I think even the excuses start to wear thin at a certain point. If our armed forces took every effort to minimize casualties, then why did the Administration fight tooth and nail to delay release of these videos until after Qhaddafi had been hung and the president had done her speech? It doesn’t make sense. It feels like a throwback to a more primitive era than the Trojan War..<br><br>No matter how unavoidable it is, chaos is still chaos. Death is still death. The United States still has a responsibility to the people of Libya—hence the “Responsibility to Protect.” If the goal here is to restore “order” and to “keep the peace,” then this kind of behavior sends the wrong message. What are our partners in the future Libyan government supposed to learn from the greatest democracy on earth relying on these kinds of tactics? How are we supposed to face our friends in Italy, who are burying their dead after a US missile hit their consulate compound? Surely, we are better than this.<br><br><b>3.48 AM</b><br><br><b>Thursday, June 7, 2007</b><br><br>New New York Times poll today. A month into the intervention—it’s hard not to notice how the Clinton White House insists this is an “intervention” not an “invasion”—a majority of Americans still approve of the job the president is doing (54-34). Dicier situation on the whole Libya issue, with only 51 percent approving a month out and 47 disapproving. President only doing slightly better on “other foreign policy issues” with 53 approving of her job overall.<br><br>Maybe the situation will change once more people hear the aircraft carrier speech. I don’t know. The president has always had a likability issue, not that it’s fair. <br><br>Beyond the warning signs coming from Wall Street (which Hillary has no control over, Republican complaints about Fannie Mae and Secretary Johnson’s ties to them notwithstanding), the biggest issue is the WMDs situation. Namely: Where are they? Were they destroyed? Smuggled out? Sold? Is it possible that the program was far less along than we thought but, if that’s the case, what about the mobile chemical weapons units that Clark testified to Congress about? What about the sarin gas sample that Ambassador Albright presented to the United Nations? We need to know exactly what happened here, whether the president was deceived or the intelligence services were wildly incompetent. I don’t know the answer; but I do know we need one.<br><br>If we made a mistake, it’s better just to cop to that and move on. Personally, I always supported the war on humanitarian grounds. It was always outrageous what Qhaddafi was doing to his people and I think most Americans will accept the “responsibility to protect” argument. We just need a definitive explanation for this and other failures so they don’t happen again and it doesn’t seem like the president “tricked” the American people. We need something so the usual types—Gravel, Maher, Moore—don’t succeed in their effort to turn Clinton into a new Nixon.<br><br><b>1.52 PM</b><br><br><b>Tuesday, June 12, 2007</b><br><br>A new report from Julian Borger of The Guardian today on the British perspective of the increasingly embarrassing absence of chemical and biological weapons in Libya and Blair’s attempts to pivot to a “humanitarian” angle:<br><br><blockquote>An intensive six-month search of Libya for weapons of mass destruction has failed to come up with anything to support the stories used by the Blair Administration to go to war, says a new report by a joint CIA-MI6 task force.<br><br>The interim report, which remains highly classified, describes only an “intention and capacity” to build banned weapons. Its leak has already caused reverberations through the British political establishment and there is now a debate over whether the government will risk releasing it at all.<br><br>“It’s a terrible thing,” said one government source. “I expect they’ll try to sell it as a preemptive measure and a humanitarian thing, but it demonstrates that one of the main judgments in the march to war, that Qaddafi had hundreds of tons of chemical and biological weapons ready, are false.”<br><br>Downing Street last night officially dismissed the leak as speculation, A No 10 spokesman said: “People should wait. The reports today are speculation from an unfinished draft that has not been presented or approved.”<br><br>A BBC report yesterday described how Blair had spoken to disgruntled members of his party about Qaddafi’s long history of flouting international law and his extensive list of human rights abuses. The Prime Minister urged MPs not to “overreact” to developing events and instead focus on “long-term goals and priorities.”</blockquote><br><br>Overmuch, me thinks. Blair had best hope that there’s nothing to Hersh’s reports of “suppressed” stories of popular unrest in Libya. Otherwise, he might experience something like accountability.<br><br><b>1.52 PM</b><br><br><b>Friday, June 15, 2007</b><br><br>After today’s riots, I think it’s pretty clear the Pentagon seriously misjudged the post-war situation in Libya. More dead. State and USAID personnel wounded. I think the president is supposed to deliver remarks tonight with good news: more troops and more attention to pacify the country and support the new transitional government, but it isn’t good. Rumor also on the street that the Europeans are planning a response to the Italian consulate issue—a coordinated reduction in US diplomatic staff across the continent. <br><br>It’s not good. It’s really not good. War plans are designed to be flexible and they need to be to achieve any kind of success. Let’s hope Clark still has some strength in him before this entire situation slips out of our control. We can’t afford a delay in the nation-building process, lest we betray the young women that President Clinton so eloquently defended earlier this month.<br><br><b>11.55 PM</b><br><br><b>Thursday, June 21, 2007</b><br><br>Looks like Clark’s out at Defense. Petraeus is in. All signs point to a serious screw-up in Libya, with the Pentagon struggling to handle the growing presence of extremist groups from regions as far-flung as Afghanistan (try to spell “al-Qaeda” without looking it up, I dare you). New York Times has a devastating account from one one-time pro-war writer on the collapse of services in Tripoli and US forces reduced to the city’s heavily fortified center.<br><br>If voters won’t punish Clinton for finding no WMDs, maybe they’ll punish her for letting Libya collapse into civil war. If rumor is to be believed, Cheney’s gearing up to launch soon with a promise to “clean up” the mess left behind by his two predecessors.<br><br>If it’s true, at least we’ll finally have some competence in government for a change.<br><br><b>2.29 PM</b></p>`)

            <p>Posted by Sean Quinn at 4:44 PM, October 14<br><br><blockquote><p>There were the most beautiful bevies of girls everywhere I looked in Des Moines that afternoon — they were coming home from high school — but I had no time now for thoughts like that and promised myself a ball in Denver… . So I rushed past the pretty girls, and the prettiest girls in the world live in Des Moines.</p><footer>—John Kerouac, <cite>The Road</cite></footer></blockquote><br><br>Most of her life, Janice Reynolds lived life as a Republican, volunteering for Bush in 1992 and his son in 2000. After Hillary tossed her hat in the ring in 2004 and she saw an opportunity to elect America’s first female president, Janice threw herself into life as a “Hillary for America” organizer. She had high hopes for the re-election campaign in 2008, but she had questions, namely: “Why aren’t we canvassing yet?”<br><br>Accustomed to the energy of the ‘04 race, it seemed strange to her that Hillary’s campaign was letting go of the network of activist women that had brought it so much success a few years ago. People aren’t knocking on doors or organizing any more “women’s potlucks” in Des Moines. Phonebanking, sure, but it seemed like in the final stretch the campaign is being asked to pursue different tactics to halt Dolementum.<br><br>“They have all these data consultants who tell us where to direct our energy,” says Janice, settling into her role as one of Hillary’s Des Moines Community Directors. “It’s more sophisticated than anything I could come up with. They have numbers that show that it’s eyes and ears, not feet that will win this race.”<br><br>Hillary for America Director James O’Brian showed us some of their work, demonstrating a map dividing Des Moines into 41 neighborhoods with their own specialized characteristics. In each of these neighborhoods, the campaign has several Neighborhood Team Leaders doing what they call “hyper-targeting”—using personalized text messages and phone calls to turn out voters, with occasional “direct in-person appeals.”  O’Brian said each NTL had undergone and met a series of specific challenges the field organizers had presented.<br><br>(If you want more on Clinton’s unique ground game, check out Al Giordano’s blog, <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>The Field</span></u>.)<br><br>Whether Team Hillary’s high-tech approach to the campaign season remains to be seen, though Janice smiled as she told us about how the approach had yielded multiple, unofficial “satellite offices” from highly motivated supporters reached via text, phone, or social media. These volunteers were invited to meet with NTL for intensive training, derived from focus group experimentation, on the kinds of messages that might resonate with their voters.<br><br>With Hillary in town, the energy was less on these efforts and more on providing the candidate with an audience for her economic address. Since the economic downturn that began this summer with the popping of the housing bubble and near-failure of several major U.S. banks, Clinton has refocused her campaign less away from the domestic terror and foreign policy topics that are her clear preference toward what Secretary of Treasury Corzine has delightfully termed “food on table” issues, with the stalled healthcare reform drive and investments in high-tech industries forming the basis of that.<br><br>Enthusiastic support from volunteers notwithstanding, it’s unclear the degree to which this message is resonating with Iowa voters and others across the Midwest. Putting aside the lack of investment in the state from the Clinton camp (this is the first visit to a potential tipping point state in weeks, with most of the President’s focus being directed toward New Orleans and Chicago), neither the program nor the dysfunction a divided Washington brings much more than tepid crowds in this farm state.<br><br>Local Republicans have exploited spotty attendance to hold small protests outside campaign venues with a pantsless, lipstick-stained Bill Clinton impersonator—an attack that has dogged Hillary these past few years. Clinton Field Team Leader Ken Holland described the man’s appearance as “disheartening” when I pointed him out. “That Republicans, even with their nominee, disparage the first female president with these kinds of personal attacks is the height of misogyny.”<br><br>Nonetheless, it’s these kinds of troubles that make most Republicans regret sitting out this race during the primaries. Dole remains neck-and-neck (<span style="color:darkblue;"><u>per Nate’s latest projections</span></u>), but as the <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>New York Times</span></u> reported yesterday, large numbers of conservatives believe that their nominee’s views are out of step with the party overall, leading to dampening enthusiasm. More problematically, the presence of two women in the contest—while historically significant—is proving a real problem for Republicans trying to turnout male, conservative-leaning voters.<br><br>We’ll be following Elizabeth Dole’s campaign in Ohio tomorrow as it goes between Marietta and Athens. After that, we’ll rejoin the Clinton camp in Cleveland where she’ll be having her first major rally with her husband. We look forward to reporting to you then.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Huffington Post: Campaign Pre-Mortem: Dems Lifted By Kennedy’s Coattails, GOP Sinks Further Into the Crazy</h3>
          <p>Posted April 12, 2008 04:22 PM<br>By Arianna<br><br>Read More: [Martin Luther King Jr.], [Ted Kennedy], [Ron Paul], [George W. Bush]<br><br>On the eve of his historic health care vote, President Kennedy spoke to House Democrats. He began his remarks by invoking the memory of Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhumane.” <br><br>The moment cast in sharp relief the difference between the two parties. As Democrats lined up for floor speeches extolling a bill that would—after a yearlong process of negotiations and compromises—give Americans a public option and real care to millions, Republicans spent their time in lockstep opposition. The biggest question was not whether any Republican congressmen would support a bill destined to pass, but who would trot out the most outlandish and overwrought objection.<br><br>Indeed, as I watched this and other fights over the last three years, I’ve been reminded of another Martin Luther King quote, delivered as part of a sermon in 1963 as he struggled to advance the cause of the marginalized and dispossessed. It came amid similar, kneejerk opposition: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of convenience and comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”<br><br>If we’re seeing this degree of opposition in times of unprecedented peace, with a good (albeit slowing) economy, and a popular president, what can we expect when times get tough? It’s enough to make you miss the good-natured bungling of early George W. Bush. <br><br>Today, the GOP is more radical than it has ever been. Since it evicted Bush and Cheney’s sycophants and installed Ron Paul’s lunatics, the party has picked fights it hasn’t needed to against people it can’t afford. It tried to draw out confirmation hearings against Justice Janet Reno and halt efforts to reform No Child Left Behind. It nearly derailed immigration reform with poison pill amendments, obstructed the National Education Trust Fund, and made hearings on trade agreements with China into highly televised circuses with their stunts.<br><br>Their toxic smokescreen of fear-mongering (immigrants are “invading our borders”; green energy investment “will bankrupt the country”) and cynical un-truths (Kennedy’s executive orders will “force gays into our churches”) reveal a party standing in the doorway of progress.<br><br>While many of the Democratic Party’s policies are deeply flawed (the rich have gotten richer, largely due to compromises between the White House and Blue Dogs) there’s no denying that the lives of millions of Americans will be improved because of what the Democrats have done. The agenda post-2008 looks to address the few problems that exist, starting with Kennedy’s promise to let Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of 2010.<br><br>Unless they return to sanity, the GOP risks sinking into further irrelevance. It would take a truly cataclysmic, earth-shattering development to reverse the gains of the last three years and Kennedy’s sky-high approval ratings (64% by Gallup’s last count). <br><br>So long as the sun keeps shining in Washington, the doom and gloom of nominee presumptive Paul is unlikely to appeal to more than the over-stimulated, online fringes. <br><br>What we need now are Republican leaders who can take inspiration from King and his words, who will approach issues decently and honestly. Far be it from me to praise George Bush, but now might be the time for a return to “compassionate conservatism.”<br><br><br><b>Related News on Huffington Post:</b><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Arnie Faces Budget Crunch in California</span></u><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Bush’s New Book: Media Reactions for Upcoming Tell-All</span></u><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Too Much and Never Enough?

    e.pages.push(`<h3>The Shadow Cabinet</h3>
              <p>washingtonpost.com  > Opinions<br>Wednesday, January 17, 2007<br><br>Who exactly is driving our foreign policy? It’s a fair question to ask, with President Ted Kennedy’s latest health scare giving him a week in Walter Reed Hospital. So far, Kennedy has focused primarily on domestic issues, passing an extensive healthcare bill and capping a midterm campaign with a breakthrough on immigration reform. But in the past 6 months, foreign crises have increasingly drawn his energy, whether in Darfur, the Caucasus, or the Levant, and above all, in these last two years of his first term—yes, he still intends to run for re-election—Kennedy will face the daunting prospect of winding down an ongoing war. <br><br>Yet the president seems entirely aloof, even absent, from the most important discussions taking place in the White House over how to manage the war. After the conflict in Lebanon last year, the potential for greater crises in the Middle East is high, and the risk of American troops being drawn in to a wider conflict is real. They’re already fighting in the region as is. Withdrawal plans have been scuttled, and the White House’s proposed exit timeline is fuzzy. But when Kennedy was asked about the war two weeks ago, he reiterated his campaign pledge to get “every American troop out.” <br><br>So which is it? The answer may lie in Kennedy’s top advisors. Eager to avoid the obvious comparisons to another President Kennedy’s “Best and Brightest” managing a war, these figures apparently are called “The Inner Circle” on the Washington cocktail circuit. Others prefer the term “Shadow Cabinet.” Much more innocuous. <br><br>A few of these top figures are not quite hiding in the shadows, but in fact have been publicly appointed by the president to fill vacant roles in the past 3 months. Wesley Clark earned widespread praise when he was selected to head the Defense Department, and everyone within a 100 mile radius of DC knows somebody who’s insisted to them that Richard Holbrooke’s childhood dream is to be Secretary of State. Others, however, have roles largely unknown to the public. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a frequent advisor, as is former Secretary of Defense William Perry. <br><br>Perhaps it’s terribly unremarkable that two top members of the last Democratic administration are advising the current Democratic administration, but senior officials tell me that Kennedy has relied on those two more than many inside the White House to direct foreign policy. Word is that his National Security Advisor hasn’t spoken to the president since the Russo-Georgian crisis last December, and before that, he hadn’t had a meeting with Kennedy in 3 months.<br><br>Even Sandy Berger, former Deputy National Security Advisor and current probationer, has been a leading voice inside the Inner Circle. <br><br>What do all these lifetime members of the foreign policy establishment have in common? Well, they all served in the Clinton administration, but more than that, they all remain in very close contact with another Clinton. It’s no secret that the New York Senator from Arkansas has had her eye on the presidency for years, and that at the slightest sign of Kennedy’s health worsening, she is sure to lead the pack in any Democratic primaries that ensue. But according to senior officials, she already has a heavy hand inside the White House. Albright and Holbrooke reportedly talk to her “near-daily” and Secretary Clark meets with her “several times a week.” <br><br>For many inside the Inner Circle, their standing in the Kennedy White House gives them a chance to fight old wars, and perhaps wage new ones. Bill Clinton famously called his inaction during the Rwandan genocide the gravest mistake of his presidency, and his top advisors have spent years living that down. Memoirs about Bosnia, Rwanda, and the failure in Somalia abound. One figure inside the White House told me, “they’re all about settling old scores from the Clinton years.”<br><br>So perhaps the best route in determining President Kennedy’s foreign policy strategy would be to ask what Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy strategy is. With withdrawal plans dashed, and calls for escalation growing, can we be sure that this Inner Circle will keep President Kennedy away from ramping up the war? Or will Hillary Clinton and her Shadow Cabinet be too eager to write their next memoirs? <br><br>2007 The Washington Post</p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>wired.com</u></span><br>SECURITY | 11.03.07 | 2:36 PM<br><br>Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military has been talking up its new armored vehicles’ capabilities. In Iraq, you can spot vehicles, like the BAE Caiman, shuttling troops around from Basra to Baghdad. Fighting a seemingly intractable insurgency while simultaneously turning operations over to the Iraqi military, a spate of new Pentagon contracts have been signed to design more armored vehicles. The big problem? They keep running off the road.<br><br>According to a report in Jane’s Defense Weekly, virtually none of these vehicles can even drive properly. Dozens of instances of unresponsive steering, stuck wheels, and plain faulty engineering are cited. In one interview, a Marine who fought in Fallujah was highly critical. “I mean we’re driving this fucking thing and it just goes straight into a lake. Right off the bridge. It wasn’t high up either. It’s such bullshit.”<br><br>In Congressional hearings led by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) last week on the withdrawal plans, lawmakers were shocked to hear how badly the vehicles have been performing. Statistics gathered from the Defense Department reported a 400% increase in accidents this year, the highest on record since 1969.<br><br>“Is the administration aware of how many accidents have occurred?” a stunned Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) asked. When policy advisors from the Pentagon responded that they had briefed the White House on all recent developments in Iraq, Sen. McCain was incredulous. “If we can’t even build vehicles that can drive without going off the road, how can the administration expect us to withdraw so soon?”<br><br>According to Marines interviewed by Jane’s, the one highlight of these new armored vehicles are their bomb-proof doors. Casualties from IEDs set off by insurgents have actually decreased dramatically. But even this development is a double-edged sword.<br><br>One GI from the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines painted a vivid picture: “The problem is it’s a two-way street right? You can’t blow the door off, but you can’t open the fucking thing either. My buddy was in one of those APCs when it went into the water. He said he couldn’t even open the door. It’s a death trap. I don’t know how he got out actually, but he told me about it the next day.”<br><br>Rattling these stories off to Pentagon appointees testifying before Congress, McCain laid the blame squarely on the White House. “On so many issues, not just with this but the entire withdrawal, President Kennedy is driving us right off the road, straight into the ditch. We’re deep underwater now. It’s a little like…heh…ah, nevermind.”<br></p>`)

          <p><i>Star Wars Imperial March plays</i><br><br>ANNOUNCER: Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He’s Alex Jones, simulcast for the first time on both InfoWars Dot Com and on the SiriusXM Satellite Radio Network. Now, live from Allen, Texas, it’s Alex Jones.<br><br>JONES: Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this October 2nd show, going out across the country and worldwide. We have an exciting program for you today. Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is going to be on our show later this hour to talk about a new TV show he’s working on. Very exciting to see this show, which he’ll tell you more about, got greenlit in part due to all your vocal support online. <br><br>Then, a few hours later today, we have another huge guest, a real patriot who you might remember from this year’s Republican Party primaries, here for his maiden voyage. That’s all very exciting and coming up in a few hours so be sure to stay tuned in. He’ll have an announcement about his political future and that of the country that will shock you. More on that later.<br><br>In the meantime, I want to cover the financial and political developments and I want to give listeners a chance to express their own frustrations on the propaganda, the different kinds of propaganda being forced down our throats by the controlled corporate media. It’s all many heads of the same monster.<br><br>I again watched television for about 45 minutes this morning during my workout. I like to maintain my physique, not unlike a certain washed-up governor in that way. Now, mostly I get my news, like most of you, through clips online uploaded to YouTube. I don’t really watch news itself from show to show, from program to program. Forcing yourself to listen to the same few voices on the Globalist News Network for hours on end is the quickest way to get hypnotized. Still, because of all of the craziness going on, I want to know what the enemy is saying and so I’m tuning in. <br><br>Let me tell you, it’s just un-be-lievable what they’re up to. The lying, the twisting, the spinning… The terrorizing the public. Blaming the public for the 1.7 trillion stock market loss that we witnessed when the “bailout failed on Monday.” They’re going to force through another bail-out again today as the stock market loses another couple hundred points, erasing the few gains made yesterday. Oh, and we’ll probably get another press conference from the Woman Killer’s vice president about how continuing sectarian violence means he needs to delay the timetable for withdrawal from Iraq because yada yada yada.<br><br>This is just typical. You’ll all remember I wasn’t the biggest fan of Bush or Kennedy in ‘04 but, with Kennedy, I figured, “what do we have to lose?” This was a guy who had been part of a rotten system for decades but he’d seen his brothers get killed by You Know Who. Whole family massacred by Bush’s daddy. I thought, you know, he’ll probably lie. He’ll probably steal, but at the very least he’ll be anti-CIA, anti-Them. He’ll do some purges and get us out of the wars before he goes back to Massachusetts with some bags of cash. <br><br>(Pause)<br><br>JONES: Boy, was I wrong. What’s the first thing he does? National Unity Cabinet. This guy talks like he’s Lincoln or something and then immediately throws together the worst people you’ve ever seen! I mean, these are real DC swamp creatures and geriatrics. He kept Powell in there. Armitage. We got the Clinton hanger-ons with Albright at State and Holbrooke as the “war czar.” Christ, even Shultz is back—as if the swamp monster didn’t do enough damage in the 80s! <br><br>And what happened? (Yelling) What did I say would happen when he first announced this stuff? We got deeper in. These so-called experts on insurgencies have one response to everything and it’s “troop surge.” They’re all happy to send off your sons and daughters to die, or to authorize another CIA operation that makes everything worse, because they know they won’t be paying the cost. “Oh, we need to stabilize the situation before we leave so no one fills the vacuum.” Give me a break. They’ll let you pick up the bill and, oh, as a token of appreciation here’s your watered down “KennedyCare.” Couldn’t even force through his communist public option bullshit. <br><br>Speaking of the big man up top, They sure got rid of him quick, didn’t they? Two years of him talking and doing his “deal-maker” schtick and now he’s completely gone. It’s their pliable puppet Barnes on TV now. No one in the media has the guts to say it, but Kennedy’s probably dying in some secret underground hospital underneath the Mall because They injected cancer into his brain. It was probably after he tried declassifying all those documents on his brothers—which were all fake by the way. <br><br>But he’s trudging along into November. Trudging. Trudging.  All those whispers on the Democrat side about “a new generation of leadership” never really amounted to anything and so we got the corporate media practically wheeling the guy out on a stretcher at the convention stage. Four more years? Give me a break. Four more minutes, maybe.<br><br>I can’t say I like the Republicans much either this year. I might just stay home after the globalist hegemonists stole the nomination from Paul so they could get another Bush / Cheney ticket to “finish the job.” If the polls are to be believed—which they’re not—the whole contest is neck and neck because people feel just so dismal about both parties. Someone could really use that to build a third way if they wanted but, heh, more on that later.<br><br>I will say one thing I do like about the Republicans this year. I like how honest they’re being this year. No more of this “compassionate conservatism” garbage or “family values” campaigning. I don’t know what’s gotten into the guy but the new George Bush is mean. He’s aggressive. He’s not afraid to call Democrats what they are and the whole party is following suit. If this is the End of Days like it seems, at least people are going down swinging.<br><br>That’s probably a good time for a commercial break. I’ll say up top that tickets for the Info Wars “End of the Party” Tour are sold out in most locations, but you can check all availability on our website. In the meanwhile, I want to talk to you about non-fluoridated water…</p>`)

Back then, Big Media and Ted Kennedy were more than willing to play nice with Hillary. The Democratic Party leadership said they were “excited” by Hillary’s historic presidency. They wanted to be seen with her. They loved her. Even Jon Stewart stopped his snickering.<br><br>Then, what happened? <b>The fossils realized they couldn’t use her like they did W.</b> Hillary went before the Congress and announced her intention to secure comprehensive Social Security reform, to go further than the have measure under W. Then, she and McCain revealed their bold efforts to contain Princess Pootie and his alliance of autocrats. Hillary ignored the people who told her that you couldn’t cut a third way and <b>went out to the people to build a new movement, something the Bushies never tried.</b><br><br>And instead of accepting that, what did Ted and his Big Media cronies do? They laughed at her. He disrespected Hillary despite her huge landslide in 2004. He pretended like THE 2004 ELECTION DIDN’T MATTER, AS IF SHE DIDN’T SAVE HIM AND THE PARTY’S @SS. <br><br>Testy Ted did nothing when Mike Grovel launched his failing primary campaign against her for 2008. He made scarcely a whisper when the Senate Klan Leader Robert Byrd expressed his “outrage” at the president “politicizing” national security—which she didn’t do. His operatives held conference calls, issued memos, and showed their scorn all through the process of pushing through Social Security reform, putting up every roadblock even after Hillary had him removed <b>from his beloved chairmanship and used a bipartisan coalition to replace him with Mike Enzi.</b><br><br>He put up fight after fight but, as we all knew, Teddy and his foolish allies—Whinestone, “Barack,” and Scamders—were no match. They couldn’t stop President Hillary from overcoming cloture. Their feeble filibusters did little to stop the march of progress. The pitiful rallies and protests outside the Capitol only underscored how sick, stupid, and pathetic the entire rebellion was. Not even Big Media’s shrill whining about Hillary’s alleged approval rating going into an Election year against another member of the Bush Crime Family could make them seem significant.<br><br>But it’s a good sign for the future.<br><br>With Hillary curtailing Princess Pootie’s influence with her Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Libya, one thing is clear: America doesn’t need any more traitors. <b>Now’s time to take Ted to the Old Folks Home and to deport “Barack.”</b><br><br>Maybe after they get booted, Hillary can finally have the peace she needs to fight for the rights of Americans everywhere. Once the enemies at home are defeated, we can finally make America safe abroad.<br><br>Punish the wicked so that the righteous might prosper. <br><br><b>870 Comments »    - Posted in Hillary, Kennedy, Obama by Staff</b></p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>REGIME CHANGE AT HARVARD</h3>
              <p>By Paul Atlantic<br>February 12, 2006<br><br>During icebreakers in my intro to comparative literature class, a student introduced himself as an “anti-imperialist,” before ever telling me his name. He discussed attending December’s so-called “National March on Washington” to “end the war.” This student then began to describe lurid conspiracy theories connecting the Bush family to terrorists with unpronounceable names. When I asked him where he learned this, he answered: a blog called “usscoletruth.”<br><br>I moved to another seat in my next class. <br><br>Iraq is a country with a population of 27.86 million people. It is 5,800 miles removed from Harvard. Yet the issue over whether Saddam Hussein poses a threat to the region and must be removed from power by an international coalition has torn apart this campus like no other. Few discuss the specifics of UN resolutions, President Clinton’s initial proposal to extend the no-fly zone, or how President Bush’s plans failed so spectacularly in Congress. <br><br>Instead, loud-mouthed trendsetters eager to meet girls and make friends with fellow self-proclaimed anti-imperialists shout that the military campaign closing in on Baghdad is a “war for oil.” Often they march across campus carrying signs that crudely depict Clinton and Vice President McCain as bloodthirsty warmongers. There is no room for nuance in this debate.<br><br>These protests are not just limited to Ivy League universities either. If opinion polls are anything to go by, Clinton has dismal numbers with young voters, even as her overall approval ratings tick up to the low-twenties. At a White House press conference last week, when the president was asked what she would say to voters feeling upset with both parties, she laughed, “Get over yourself!” Instant soundbite quality aside, it does lead many to wonder whether the administration understands the depth of anger over the war.<br><br>Yet despite these intense passions, few students have any connections to such far-away events. None of them are part of the force comprising 230,000 combat troops and many more contractors who have been deployed in Iraq. None of them have family who were gassed to death by the tyrant Saddam Hussein. None of them have been harmed by anthrax. They are merely spectators with no personal connections.<br><br>When I attended a moderately well-attended protest, I encountered a man in his thirties, not carrying any signs or banners, but participating in chants of “no blood for oil.” After he introduced himself as Salah, I asked him if he agreed with some of the speakers who had just called our own soldiers “baby-killers,” and whether that meant he wished violence upon them. He looked at me incredulously. “Are you serious?” Salah asked, voice rising. He proceeded to go on a rant about the death toll using figures from an American NGO called Iraq Body Count. In fact, the administration has strongly contested these reports, citing unspecified Pentagon documents that show lower death tolls, with Vice President McCain saying he doesn’t “believe the Iraqis are telling the truth about how many have been killed.” <br><br>Our interaction ended with Salah interrogating me over whether I had any personal connections to the region. When I told him no, he scoffed, and asked what I was doing here in the first place. “We’re talking about human beings. These are real people who are dying, this isn’t just some book report.”<br><br>Webster’s dictionary defines imperialism as “the actions by which one nation is able to control other usually smaller or weaker nations.” One has to ask whether such student activists are having the same effects on campus, cowing those who disagree into silence by putting up flyers in dorms and inviting extremists like Michael Moore to speak. Worst of all has been the failure of campus administrators, who have been either disastrously incompetent or working on behalf of other interests. Representative Eric Cantor’s widely seen hearings excoriating faculty at Ivy League schools rightly dominated headlines last month as the bombs begin to fall on Iraq, but far more needs to be done.<br><br>College administrators may not have wanted to wage a counterinsurgency on campus, but as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it “you go to war with the army you have.”</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>A Portrait of Gephardt as More Continuity, Less Change</h3>
              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>nytimes.com</u></span><br>Sept. 27, 2006<br><br>In Bob Woodward’s hotly anticipated new book, “Disarray,” President Gephardt is characterized as mercurial, indecisive, and even impulsive in his actions during the early months of his presidency. Like his predecessor, Mr. Gephardt emerges as a figure supremely confident in his own ability to shape history, casting aside advice to the contrary. This is hardly the candidate many thought they knew during the 2004 campaign, when the Democratic nominee campaigned on his competence and character, jabbing at President Bush for “not having the nerves” to steer the floundering mission in Iraq to some sort of success.<br><br>In Mr. Woodward’s gossipy yet highly readable account of a crucial point in the war, to the shock of many in the Bush administration’s transition team, Mr. Gephardt would change his mind on key issues multiple times in the same meeting. Intelligence briefers attempting to persuade the incoming president on the need for a new strategy to sort out the roiling Sunni-Shia sectarianism in Iraq were dismissed cavalierly. “It’s like deja vu,” one CIA analyst complained to Mr. Woodward.<br><br>Yet it would be a mistake to take these anonymous characterizations of the commander-in-chief at face value. Even senior officials participating in Mr. Gephardt’s war cabinet have only a limited understanding of the man and the difficult choices he faces, not only in Iraq but with the ongoing campaign in Afghanistan, the standoff over weapons inspectors in Iran, and rising tensions with Russia and China. Equal fault lies in the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, whose dismal handling of the post-dictatorship government has fueled the insurgency, according to a leaked intelligence report. <br><br>The book stays laser-focused on the White House however, with various officials castigating Gephardt’s advisors as “inept” and even “unqualified” for their duties. Mr. Woodward’s previous book, “Bush’s War,” vividly chronicled the debates leading up to the invasion of Iraq as well as serious doubts over the feasibility of a unilateral military campaign in Afghanistan. Many sources quoted in the previous book were withering in their criticism of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, over his early role in prodding Mr. Bush towards deferring to military solutions in international relations.<br><br>The same can now be said of “Disarray,” which tears apart the carefully curated images of Mr. Gephardt’s top appointees. Secretary of Defense Wesley Clark is characterized as out-of-touch, with few firmly held beliefs, and presiding over a Pentagon more at war with itself than with the Iraqi insurgency. Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke is portrayed as a passive figure, unable or unwilling to restrain his deputies’ overreach, leading to ruinous relations between the U.S. and Nouri al-Maliki’s government in Iraq.<br><br>Above all, fundamental questions loom over the future of the coalition’s mission in Iraq. With a rudderless White House uninterested in pursuing any other course, Mr. Woodward’s book ends on a gloomy note. Reports circulating inside the intelligence community suggest that an enormous surge in the number of U.S. forces deployed to the country may be authorized as soon as next month, with the troop levels reaching even 200,000. Ironically, for all of Mr. Gephardt’s rhetoric about a “change in leadership,” this recommendation is right in line with what former Vice President Richard Cheney has been suggesting in interviews since late summer.<br><br>Mr. Woodward’s highly critical portrait of the president will provide ammo for both supporters and opponents of the war in Iraq alike, but Mr. Gephardt’s image as a decisive break from a chaotic predecessor will take the most damage. Pages of “Disarray” will remind many readers of Mr. Bush’s weakest qualities, and alarm those who expected more from the commander-in-chief. In one emblematic anecdote, Mr. Woodward recounts a meeting concerning signs that insurgents were regathering in Fallujah, which had been the site of the war’s fiercest fighting yet in November 2004. When C.I.A. Director James Clapper told the president bluntly that this suggested the coalition’s current strategy was not working, Gephardt blanched.<br><br>“He hasn’t even thought through the next day, let alone the next year,” Mr. Clapper said. “What Gephardt said was, in effect, That’s why we’ve got to stay the course. But there has been no debate over strategy, no serious discussion, it’s just been completely ignored.”<br><br><b>Correction: Sept. 29, 2006</b><br><br><i>The Books of The Times review on Wednesday, about “Disarray” by Bob Woodward, referred imprecisely to the number of Iraqi civilian casualties in the Iraq war. While the number of those killed estimated by the independent Iraq Body Count organization stands at 112,973, the number of casualties — killed, wounded and missing — as of Sept. 29 was 321,048.</i></p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>NewYorkMetro.com</u></span><br><br><b>Intelligencer Briefing</b><br><b>President tosses press corps out of the ring</b><br>‘Big Three’ CEOs release joint statement attacking ‘assault on the First Amendment’<br><br>By <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Jacob Bernstein</u></span><br><br>Like any good wrestling match, it ended with screaming and a shocking, attention-grabbing stunt. Leaning over the top of his lectern, his fingers pointing in accusation, President Jesse “The Brain” Ventura cut his own press conference short by announcing that he was tired of “jackals and jackasses” and expelling the White House Correspondents Association from the White House Grounds. Shocked reporters received 20 minutes to flee the briefing room before The Mind had them “removed.” Whether he or the Secret Service intended to do the “removing” was unclear.<br><br>For those in the Beltway, this latest brawl is a shock but not surprising. Since Ventura’s <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>tumultuous elevation to the presidency</u></span> three years ago, the president has made no secret of his loathing for the news media, using his podium and his “Weekly Webstreams” to call out specific commentators and pundits that he considers “in the tank for the powerful.”<br><br>In the week prior to the Press Room Blow-Up, President Ventura attacked <i>New York Times</i> commentator Judith Miller (“the mouthpiece of the people upstairs”), talk show host Bill Maher (“a smug, stupid son of a bitch”), and Fox commentator Bill O’Reilly (“spineless puke” and “a goose-stepping chickenhawk”). These attacks came on top of the president’s usual screeds against former Bush Administration officials, whom the president suggested “be brought before The Hague and executed” following revelations in the Administration’s recent Torture Report.<br><br>For DC area reporters, the feeling is mutual. The president has frequently been criticized for failing to hold court as previous presidents and cutting back on the pomp usually afforded to the esteemed members Fourth Estate.<br><br>“George Bush, he is not,” said one (former) press pool reporter from a major magazine. “I mean, with both Bill and George, they’d make an effort to get to know people and look for ways we could help each other. Whenever I’ve been in a room with Jesse, it feels like he’d rather be anywhere else.”<br><br>A reporter with the <i>Washington Post</i>, a focus of the president’s ire, was even more blunt: “He sent the Secret Service to my fucking house. They said that they had received a ‘tip’ that I’d ‘stolen’ dishware from Air Force One and could either return it or expect a bill for tens of thousands of dollars. I couldn’t believe it. Who fucking does that?”<br><br>While the closure of the Press Room will further limit the press’s access to the president, it is unlikely to stop the mountains of bad press. In the immediate aftermath of the expulsion, Roger Ailes of Fox, Rick Kaplan of MSNBC, and Philip Kent of CNN released a letter describing the president’s outburst as an ”assault on the First Amendment”, contributing a “chilling effect on the freedom of the press worldwide,” and fostering “a culture of fear not dissimilar from autocratic regimes like China.”<br><br>These will add to existing criticism about the president’s efforts to accelerate a pull-out from Afghanistan and Iraq, despite firm opposition from Speaker Cantor and Minority Leader Gephardt, as well as his unilateral and <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>questionably legal</u></span> closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. <br><br>Government too remains predictably choked with gridlock, with most cabinet offices held by career officials. Though hearings have been scheduled for Ventura’s “VA for All” health plan, the overall proposal has been harshly criticized by the <i>Times</i> editorial board as well as various doctor’s groups for “socializing medicine.” A recent poll from <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Gallup</u></span> found Ventura’s support at a mere 39.2%, with many criticizing his excessive use of Executive Orders to achieve priorities.<br> <br>But perhaps none of this matters to the president. Asked two weeks ago about his low approval and the improbability of re-election, “The Mind” responded in his usual manner.<br><br>“Don’t care. Are you going to ask me a question that people care about or are you planning to just waste more of my time?”<br><br>***<br><b>Related Links:</b><br><b>➤ Previous Stories</b>: <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Intelligencer Features Archive</u></span><br><b>➤ Also In This Issue</b>: <span style="color:darkblue;"><u>New York Magazine - October 25, 2007</u></span><br><br><i>From the October 25, 2007 issue of New York Magazine.</i></p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>washingtonpost.com</u></span><br><b>Wednesday, June 1, 2005</b><br><br>President Robert Byrd proclaimed early this evening that he had pulled the U.S. government from the brink of an unprecedented default through the minting of a $1 trillion coin, catching everyone from futures traders to congressional leaders off guard. Here’s what you need to know about the shock development. <br><br><b>What’s been going on in Washington?</b><br><br>During the 2004 election, President Byrd made support for a balanced budget and opposition to former President Bush’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan centerpieces of his campaign. Once in office, he sought to move this agenda forward through his administration’s so-called “Constitution Budget,” which aimed to put the U.S. back on a path to fiscal solvency through aggressive cuts to the defense budget. Despite staunch opposition from both Republicans and many members of his own party, the President has insisted on these cuts, as well as funding for withdrawals from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of any major yearly spending bill he would sign.<br><br>Under most circumstances, the worst consequences of such a standoff would be a government shutdown, much like the ones 1995 and 1996. However, the specifics of U.S. federal spending rules make this confrontation between Byrd and Congress exponentially more urgent than prior budget disputes. 2005’s major spending bills were set to include a raising of the debt limit — the statutory limit of the amount of money the government is allowed to borrow — making it so that Byrd would be unable to veto any budgets without his desired cuts without risking the federal government going bankrupt.<br><br>While the White House repeatedly requested that Congress pass a bill solely focused on raising the debt limit so budgetary negotiations could proceed without the threat of bankruptcy looming over them, Congressional leaders from both parties demurred, maintaining that any raising of the debt limit should be passed at the same time as the overall federal budget.<br><br><b>What is the Platinum Coin?</b><br><br>The idea is that the President orders the treasury secretary to mint a $1 trillion coin out of platinum, then deposit it at the Federal Reserve. Then, just like that, the government would have an additional $1 trillion to pay off its obligations. The debt ceiling is no longer an issue. So, it’s just that: a literal coin, made out of platinum, with a value of $1 trillion.<br><br>Why platinum? The Treasury is limited by law on how much paper money and gold, silver and copper coins it can circulate at once. But due to an obscure law from the 1990s. there’s no limit on how many platinum coins it can circulate, or on their value.<br><br><b>What is on the Platinum Coin?</b><br><br>According to the Treasury, the coin uses an existing press of the US Constitution, which had been used in several gold dollar coins.<br><br><b>Does President Byrd own the Platinum Coin?</b><br><br>No. Despite the President’s proclamation at his press conference that “big daddy’s got a big coin,” it is the property of the Treasury Department.<br><br><b>Where is the Platinum Coin?</b><br><br>The Platinum Coin was last seen in President Byrd’s suit jacket, where he appeared to wave it around before laughing. The Department of Treasury has yet to comment.<br><br><b>How will this affect the standoff between Byrd and Congress over the withdrawal?</b><br><br>Reactions on the Hill have been divided between outrage, confusion and horror. Party leaders, nearing the end of an exhausting, week-long negotiation process to craft a budget without the White House’s involvement, were both at a loss as to how to proceed. A source close to Speaker Richard Gephardt expressed frustration that their boss’s extensive efforts to pry more left-leaning members of his party away from the President’s position will be undone without the threat of a default. <br><br>Members of the congressional minority expressed anger, bordering on rage, across the board. One high-ranking source close to Senate Minorty Leader Rick Santorum fumed that “that old fucking man” had just “fucked everything up,” further commenting that “we can’t do anything now. He won. Of course that goddamn cryptkeeper remembered some shit like this.”<br><br><b>What happens next?</b><br><br>Experts called in for quotes were at a loss for how things would proceed following the President’s pronouncement. A source with a background in coinage law asked to comment for this story was silent for roughly a minute before saying, “Well, I suppose it’s technically legal,” although making sure to emphasize that the Supreme Court will have the final say. Speaking off the record, a high-ranking employee at a major multinational bank summed up the feeling on Wall Street: “I genuinely have no idea what the economic consequences are. I’m not sure if the credit rating will be downgraded. This isn’t supposed to be happening”<br><br>Market futures were down across the board after the press conference. Attempts to reach Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan through his official communication channels have so far been met without comment.</p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>RedState.com</u></span><br>April 24th, 2006<br><br>I’ll start off by giving my condolences to Satan, who will have to wait a while before being reunited with his chief deputy. It turns out he’s alive after all. After weeks of absence, President Robert Byrd finally decided to show his face today in a rare press conference. The most I can say in his favor is that he surpassed my expectations, if only because I never believed Chief of Staff Barbara Videnieks for a second when she said he was doing anything other than slurping up Jello in the Lincoln Bedroom. But when he stood (or, more accurately, sat) behind the podium and started to talk, I started to wish he was totally gone. It would be better to have no president at all than one as disastrous as him.<br><br>If you somehow missed the bombshell even bigger than the fact that the so-called leader of the free world is now seemingly wheelchair bound, here’s your recap. America has officially surrendered the War on Terror. The work started by President Bush in those fateful days in October 2004 to secure our country’s security once and for all by taking the fight to the heart of Islamo-fascist terror has been undone. Robert Byrd, who, you should remember, hadn’t spoken to an American journalist in months (notwithstanding outside of an online Q&A with a blog named <i>rEvolution</i>) has decided to re-open diplomatic communications with the so-called Islamic Republic of Iran. <br><br>In other words, Operation Super Profit is over. The Gulf Defense Fleet will be sent back to their posts, the deaths of thousands of American sailors having been for naught. And the President of the United States has proven himself to forever be a fifth columnist on the side of terrorism.<br><br>He’ll deny this, of course. According to those who are supposedly capable of translating the president’s ramblings, he’s supposedly doing this to <i>strengthen</i> the war on terror. He says he’s using our resources wisely, moving away from the “temptation” to strike a “concrete villain” and focusing on the “shadowy groups” that actually want to harm us. What a laugh! The idea that a couple angry militants hiding in caves are anything worth being afraid of is hysterical enough, but even if that were true, who does he really think is backing them? How does he think that his big boogeymen like “Al-Quieda” spring up if not for the support from the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism? <br><br>Donald Rumsfeld put it right on <i>Meet the Press</i> this weekend. If Byrd isn’t with us on the obvious need for regime change, he’s against us, which means he’s on the side of the very people he’s supposed to be trying to stop. Quite wise words, although they may leave patriotic Americans with a big question. Why is Robert Byrd, an old racist, so sympathetic towards the causes of deranged, anti-American regimes thousands of miles away? <br><br>It’s time for a history lesson.<br><br>Since the 1960s, most of us have thought of anti-American, so-called “anti-war” protesters as fitting a single type: young, radical, and urban. To be sure, this type still exists. It’s not for nothing that Byrd did so well in Boston and Berkeley on the fateful night in 2004. But there’s also another type of malevolent isolationist that has been out there: that of the bitter ex-Confederate lost-causer, still smarting over their loss in the War Between the States and predisposed to see the U.S. military as the root of all evil. While Democracy Now! won’t tell you it, it’s been these racist fifth columnists who have formed the core of all of their precious “peace” movements since the end of the War for Southern Independence. Their resentment of “Yankee rule” makes them naturally sympathize with the childish overseas ingrates who chafe over Western influence. Their fundamental hatred of America makes them opposed to endeavors to strengthen our country and supportive of, or at least indifferent towards, threats against it. And most of all, their racism makes them view nonwhites overseas as completely untouchable, dangerous to engage with and unworthy of the blessings of democracy.<br><br>Just think about Byrd’s famous line before the 2003 vote to authorize Operation Iraqi Freedom: “I weep for my country.” “His country” wasn’t the United States of America, but the Confederate States of America, who he feared could never return if America was safe. While U.S. troops may still be engaged in operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan, it likely won’t be for long. Byrd mumbling that he “doesn’t want to talk about it” when asked about those conflicts wasn’t a depressed old man punting on a question—it was an obvious ruse. Our boys will be out of there soon enough, just like they will be pulled out of Germany, and then pulled out of Okinawa, and then, soon enough, pulled out of the U.S. South. Eventually, our armed forces will be so depleted that nothing will stop Byrd from proclaiming himself the new President of the Confederacy, with Conyers ruling the People’s Republic of the North.<br><br>This is how you should understand the ascension of the Byrd regime in 2004. While the left-wing media will still call it a “shocking upset” and “a massive embarrassment for the Republican Party,” there was probably no way for Bush to have defeated Byrd’s vile scheme. By combining both the northern and southern strains of anti-Americanism, he created a political Axis of Evil, bent on America’s destruction at any cost. This is exactly why he picked the Black Panther Marxist John Conyers as his VP—it represented the full consummation of this unholy union. It is our task as Republicans, as conservatives, as Americans, to wake up to this scheme and fight it with all we have. This isn’t just our 1776, but our 1861.<br><br>For Union. For liberty. For Rumsfeld’08.</p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>nbcnews.com</u></span><br>August 12, 2006<br><br>If you travel the country during election season, you’re bound to see a bevy of familiar sights. Campaign floats on parade. Candidates giving speeches in town squares. Lawn signs as far as the eye can see. But if you visit the select districts on the National Republican Congressional Committee’s blue-to-red target list, you may see something entirely new: Americans dressed like soldiers straight from Roman times talking about lowering taxes, moral values, and the danger of the Assad regime.<br><br>Before you call up Minority Leader Eric Cantor to let him know that his party’s staffers have gone nuts, know that this is all according to plan—and coming to the top. According to national Republican campaign officials, they began the program as a two-pronged project to increase youth interest in conservative causes and make fun of President Robert Byrd in the process.<br><br>In case you’re missing the joke, here’s the recap. During one of his rare press conferences this March, President Byrd had a moment that many found confusing. While making case against increased support for the pro-democracy rebels fighting against the Assad regime, he cracked a joke at his own expense, saying, "People have been talkin' a lot about a conquest of Syria recently, and I tell 'em. I tell 'em. I remember the first one! In 64 BC!" Then, he grew quiet. The President's gaze appeared to become distant before he suddenly began yelling, “Does Pompey, the arrogant fool, see the might of our Republic as commensurate with the breadth of our domain? Provincia Syria—what next? Shall we invite the Arsacids into the Senate, too? People of Rome, take heed. The greatest of all your enemies may be your own legions.”<br><br>I spoke to a high-ranking member of the National Republican Campaign Committee on how they reacted to this incident. “At first, I thought he completely lost it,” he said. “Pompey? People of Rome? Legions? What is he talking about? We were gonna let it speak for itself. But after, you know, what happened in ‘04, I thought that we couldn’t afford to ignore stuff like this. So, what other to do than to meet him where he is? If Byrd says we’re legions, hell yeah. We’re legions, all right. Badass.”<br><br>That’s where it all started. Soon after, Republican campaigns were ordering enough togas, swords, spears and Galea helmets to make Caesar himself blush. It’s hard not to be impressed when visiting their “campaign campaigns” in places like King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where what seemed like hundreds of eager Republicans stood in formation in the mall parking lot. Looking through the crowd, it was hard to immediately tell if the GOP’s stated goal of youth outreach was being accomplished. Most of the crowd was middle-aged, with some of the legionnaires looking strikingly similar to the Pennsylvania GOP’s own foot soldiers from the 2004 campaign. They looked like they were having the time of their lives, with several telling me that this was the most fun they’d had in all their years of volunteering.<br><br>Still, you could find more than a few younger people in the crowd if you looked for them. One of them, a 20-year-old community college dropout who referred to himself as “Alexandrius,” spoke to me about how these events inspired him to get involved in politics. “It’s Rome. It’s Rome, man. This is what it’s all about.” His voice rising, he continued “This is it. Right here. The barbarians are at the gates. Our civilization. They’re attacking it. They’re trying to destroy our people. Our very civilization.” He then turned around, looking at his compatriots. “At arms, men! AT ARMS!!!”<br><br>Will this “Pennsylvania campaign” prove to be a success? With only a few months left until the midterm elections and President Byrd underwater in the polls on everything from the economy to foreign policy, most experts think it will, along with other efforts in Provincias Ohio and Tennessee. If the White House can’t turn things around soon and Republicans can find a way to bring some of the energy I saw in King of Prussia to the ballot box, don’t be surprised if you see your local Democrats go the way of the Gauls.</p>`)

              <p>by Leland Palmer | Daily Kos staff writer<br>Thurs Nov 09, 2006 at 01:15:04 PM EST<br><br>The midterms have now come and gone, which means that the media is back to doing what it does best: saying that our President, Robert C. Byrd, doesn't know what he’s doing. Still bitter that their pre-election obituaries didn’t pan out in 2004 and unwilling to admit that a 60-year political veteran maybe, just maybe, has more knowledge about this business than them, they’re declaring this to be the moment that this administration “has died.” And their solution? Surprise, surprise: don’t run for re-election, don’t follow through with your promises to voters, and just follow the warmongering consensus in D.C. so the Democratic Party can “stay alive” for 2008.<br><br>Who would have thought!<br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Sen. Hillary Clinton: This election a “sobering message” to our party</u></span><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Former Secretary Rumsfeld: Americans proved they still care about Kim, stopping nuclear program</u></span><br><br>I appreciate them for being honest, at least, because the fact that they’re still saying this with these results proved that they’re just going to spout this bull crap no matter what. Grover Cleveland and Dwight Eisenhower would have killed for a midterm year this successful, but sure. Whatever. You know the rules: if you lose a senate seat in Maryland and fall short in taking out a turncoat freak like Lieberman, you now have to resign from office and let Shrub be president again! Heads, I win, tails, you lose. No matter what, the only way a party is allowed to operate in this country is to start five different wars, cut social security, and create the kind of surveillance state that would make even Richard Nixon blush.<br><br>Thankfully, our President isn’t buying into this. I’d implore the wreckers on this site who think the party needs to run away from him to listen to his speech yesterday. It shows exactly why we supported him back in ‘04 instead of your golden boy Clark.<br><br>Just listen to his response to their first question: what do you make of the results? Clearly a pointed attack, and the President wasn’t having any of it. He seized control of the narrative, letting that prick know that he “thought the returns were just fine, just fine indeed” and putting them on notice by telling them that “all you reporter boys thought Dewey would win two years ago.” Some were confused by the President’s allusion here, but their ignorance only proved why they aren’t political virtuosos like him. By comparing Shrub to Thomas Dewey, President Harry Truman’s failed opponent in 1948, he was making a very clever point that his predecessor was always an eastern establishmentarian at heart with a media apparatus staunchly behind him. Like Shrub, all of the oh-so-wise pundits thought that Dewey would win. But also like Shrub, he lost. It was an important reminder to those asshats that they haven’t been as smart as they think they are for quite a long time. <br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>New Poll: 86% of Americans see Byrd as unfit to serve, majority support invoking the 25th amendment</u></span><br><br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Dick Cheney on SNL: Watch his hilarious Sopranos sketch (with Uncle June as you-know-who!)</u></span><br><br>But the clever comparisons didn’t stop there. When asked by a hack from Faux News if he would “finally listen to the consensus from the intelligence community” and “work to neutralize the Pyongyang regime’s threat,” the President threw shade once again, showing how he’s operating on an entirely different plane. He whispered wisdom with a sly grin, speaking as thus: “Can’t do that…can’t do a war over there…gotta end this for Harry…can’t get Taft in office.” Yet another masterful allusion! By comparing the current GOP to the infamous Senator Robert Taft, he showed the country what they truly are: anti-labor, Nazi-sympathizing hacks who want to drive America into a ditch for the benefit of their corporate owners.<br><br>This is what Shrub and all of his handmaidens, from the corporate media to the Hildebeast (“D”-NY), could never understand. It’s why Byrd won. Americans want a president who knows and can learn from history. He was willing to sacrifice the twilight of his life to teach the people this lesson, but with so many refusing to learn from it, it looks like his job isn’t over. The doubters, bedwetters and fake pollsters can go take a hike. If things don’t change, I think we might just need a Byrd’08 campaign—and I know I’m not alone.<br><br><b>Discuss (253 comments)</b></p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>nytimes.com</u></span><br>April 13, 2006<br><br>Seize the military. Bombard the presidential palace. Topple the sitting leader. Take over the media. This is how we think of authoritarian regimes beginning. Yet democracy often dies in the light, as Smith and Hart, professors of government at Harvard, write in their comprehensive, enlightening and terrifyingly timely new book, The Demagogue’s Playbook. Written as an ironic imitation of Machiavelli’s The Prince, the authors make the trenchant point that democracies may die at the hands not of generals but of elected leaders.<br><br>Smith and Hart lay out a four-part test for identifying authoritarian leaders: rejecting democratic decision-making, denying the legitimacy of political opponents, tolerating or encouraging violence and engaging in conspiracy theories. “With the exception of Richard Nixon, no major-party presidential candidate met even one of these four criteria over the last century,” they note. “Robert Byrd met all of them.”<br><br>How so? It’s a story that may be recognizable to Times readers who followed the 2004 presidential campaign, but the dire importance of the moment commands us to re-tell it nonetheless. Rejecting democratic decision-making: an easy call. When speaking to large crowds of college students on the campaign trail, Byrd repeatedly referred to President Bush’s decision to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime as “illegal,” despite the fact that it was approved by Congress. Denying the legitimacy of political opponents? Another easy one: Vice President Conyers objected to Bush’s certification as President before he was even sworn in. Tolerating and encouraging violence may be more subtle, but one need only watch his rallies to see the angry, black-or-white, downright anti-democratic attitudes of his young supporters.<br><br>But it is this last point— conspiracy theories—that may be the most concerning of them all. To understand why, just look at one of the principal comparative examples that Smith and Hart bring up in their book: Venezuela. High in the American public consciousness since the Freedomista uprisings against the Chavez regime in 2005, the story of how the country’s disputed president came to power serves as the author’s principal guides Still writing as ostensive advisors, they show how “El Commandante” ascended to his throne: casting the existing political class as a corrupt, self-interested establishment, alleging a vast foreign conspiracy to keep the country down, and re-orienting politics around impossible, feel-good goals like “ending poverty” instead of targets that follow the economic consensus.<br><br>Byrd’s rhetoric on the campaign trail in 2004, his invectives against “Poppy’s boy” and all, fit this guide so perfectly that it makes one wonder if he received an advance copy of it. But it is his statements from the White House in recent weeks, which occurred after the publishing of this book, that makes one think that either the authors are downright prescient or that the President wishes to mock them. During his opening remarks at an event awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to filmmaker Michael Moore, he alluded to countless conspiracy theories, from a joke that he “paid for the event with Rummy’s funds” to alleging that “Junior” would have “given this award to a Saudi Arab” were he still in office. <br><br>With many Americans still struggling to get their heads around these endless displays of disrespect, Smith and Hart provide a valuable way of understanding what their purpose may be. President Byrd, it seems, knows exactly what he is doing, and nothing is as it seems. His sanctimonious paeans to the constitution disguise a long-running disdain for it. His proposed budgets lacking funds for the Freedomistas do not come from a desire to balance the budget, but from a sympathy with a kindred spirit in Caracas. If any of the Times’s readers are parents of the children who gave Byrd his victory in 2004, consider sending them this book. The future of democracy may depend on it.</p>`)

              <p><b>Mugglenet Dot Com » The Department of Mysteries: Voldemir Putin and George W. Fudge</b><br>by MuggleNet · Published August 12, 2008<br><br>Jo Rowling is in Washington today to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a high honor that celebrates the publication of her final book in the saga, “Harry Potter and the Doomspell Sorcerer.”<br><br>While she’s touched millions around the globe (over 500 million, according to latest book sales), her success is more than that. Part of Jo’s brilliance is the way she ties in the characters and events of her fantasy world into Our World. Harry Potter is more than just a book series—it’s a guide to live and interpret society, like Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. That fact has been picked up by some of the world’s most powerful people.<br><br>In this blog, I want to talk about the top three moments where Harry Potter showed its power to shape world events. By the time you read this, who knows, maybe there’ll be another one to add!<br><br><b>#3 Dumbledore’s Online Army</b><br><br>It started off small during the campaign. Outraged by the small-mindedness and bigotry of Bush, hundreds of Potterheads came together to mobilize an underground resistance against him. They wrote blogs giving people tips on how to talk to their friends and parents about the election. They made posters comparing Bush to Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, who did his best to focus people’s outrage on the crazy coot Dumbledore, the attention-seeking Harry, and everything else except the real menace at large (that’s the Evil Axis)!<br><br>When Bush and Dick “Umbridge” Cheney (they’re both short and fat, hehehe) got “sacked”, Potterheads launched a new chapter of the movement. Calling themselves as “Dumbledore’s Online Army” (Clark = Dumbledore, the voice of truth) they started trawling the Web and the meatworld to take the fight to the trolls, liars, and haters out there.<br><br>And it looks like they got noticed! After thwarting the Code Pink Death Eaters outside the WH, First Lady Gertrude was spotted carrying her copy of “Half Blood Prince.” Even Clark’s Secretary of State Powell got in on the fun—showing off his family’s Potter-themed Halloween costumes on Facebook!!! Not even the Recession could spoil the fun, as Secretary Nunn urged Americans to “keep up their spirits and not let sorrow win”!<br><br>It’s messages like these that show, from Day One, someone in the White House was watching closely. In the words of Albus himself, “It is important to fight and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then can evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated.”<br><br><b>#2 The Uzbek Potter Rebellion</b><br><br>A message throughout the series is that young people have the power to change the world. In Harry Potter, the students of Dumbledore’s Army were as much at the forefront of the Resistance as the Order of the Phoenix. This activism was praised in Harry Potter and in our own world. In the wise words of Albus Dumbledore, “Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.”<br><br>It is also present in smaller acts of activism. Even though her world seemed complex, Hermione didn’t let SPEW get swatted down by jeers that “it’s not that simple.” She worked hard to free the house-elves of abuse and ensure they could continue to serve others with joy.<br><br>In 2006, the little-known and forgotten country of Uzbekistan found its own Hermione Granger in the form of Galima Bukharbaeva. A journalist, Bukharbaeva reported on the Uzbek government’s attacks on young, unarmed protestors—sort of like how the Death Eaters attacked defenseless students at Hogwarts. These reports earned the attention of President Clark who vowed America would not “stand aside” and allow violence and authoritarianism to spread and clamp down on the free spread of ideas. Dumbledore’s Online Army answered his call.<br><br>Over the course of a year, DOA activists raised money to send thousands of guns and Harry Potter books to Uzbekistan to break the government’s stranglehold on people’s minds. Some traveled to Andjian to distribute wands and messages of Resistance. (“It’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ then to ‘Death Eaters.’”) Others did what they could to fight against Uzbek Quibblers by helping out local groups like the IMU and HUT—groups that might sound scary but want to help people, just like SPEW does.<br><br>The battle against the Karimov regime remains incomplete. Unfortunately it and many other Central Asian countries have fallen into civil war, but DOA and other Potterhead organizations have joined Clark in spearheading a global uprising against tyrants worldwide.<br><br><b>#1 The “Voldemort” Speech</b><br><br>Finally, we come to the big one! After Putin’s invasion of Georgia earlier this year, President Wesley Clark proved his Potter bona fides with a speech that rocked the world, one comparing Mr. Putin to He Who Shall Not Be Named:<br><br><blockquote>“In Georgia today, we are seeing an assault on freedom and democracy. This is not  complex. The assault is not defensible. The kind of evil we are seeing Russia inflict is something that our children would associate more with "Death Eaters" and "Lord Voldemort" than an upstanding member of the international community.”</blockquote><br><br>WOW! It’s a perfect comparison. Putin’s a seemingly all-powerful being who strikes fear into the hearts of millions. He is enigmatic, created by specific forces he grew up in and empowered by them as well. Just like Voldemort is shaped by his mother’s death and his father’s abandonment, so too was Putin shaped by his parents’ death and his abandonment by Mother Russia (the Soviet Union). As Putin exploited opportunities in a Wizard culture that was not ready to fight him, so too did Putin exploit the Russian FBI to rise to power. He rose to power because the man charged with catching him (that’s George W. Fudge again) tried to pretend he just wasn’t there...<br><br>For hours after the speech, DOA operatives posted like a storm, demanding that celebrities across the US declare their solidarity with Georgia by using the hashtag “#VoldemirPutin.” Major celebrities—including Arnold Schwarzenagger, Lily Allen, and Tony Danza—came out to support the movement and get the hashtag trending.  <br><br>But with the world now calling out Voldemir, the question remains... who is our Harry Potter? Who will defeat the Dark Lord once and for all? Whoever it is must be brave in the face of opposition. They must love their friends. They must keep their sense of humor and continue fighting for what is right. They must be following the leadership of Our World’s Dumbledore to create a better world. That’s right. If anyone in Our World is Harry, it must be…<br><br>...Jo Rowling.<br><br>Raise your wand high, Jo, The world needs you now more than ever!</p>`)

All men and women are needed to stand up against the most lawless Administration in American history before it is too late.</b><br><br>This resolution represents the next stage of President Clark’s plan of “seven wars in five years.” At no time in our history have American troops been involved in so many theaters simultaneously—with a record number of soldiers fighting and dying in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Somalia. <br><br><b>Gravely and seriously injured soldiers from around the world arrive at Walter Reed Medical Centre late at night so that the public is not aware of the number of soldiers wounded or the severity of their injuries. The Clark Administration has blocked FOIA requests on the numbers of caskets requisitioned for his imperial wars.</b><br><br>While devastating, these deaths are only a fraction compared to the number of innocent civilians killed in conflicts around the globe. Independent estimates suggest that as many as 3 million have died as a result of these wars, with more than 60% of deaths directly attributable to violence. In a statement delivered just yesterday, UNICEF claimed its country offices were responding to an unprecedented number of child amputees. <br><br><b>We cannot allow this to continue happening. We cannot allow Clark and his cabinet of war profiteers to expand his butchering women and children. We cannot allow an entire generation to believe we stood by and did nothing.</b><br><br>CODEGREEN, the dynamic national women’s peace group that interrupted President Clark’s 2006 State of the Union and the nomination hearings of Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, has joined forces with anti-war groups across the political spectrum for a popular front opposed to further violence and bloodshed. We are calling on our nationwide network to descend upon Washington to avert an unprecedented cataclysm.<br><br>“While Clark and his cronies think the stock market collapse has distracted Americans, the opposite is true. More and more out-of-job Americans are outraged that the Administration is cashing in on disaster while they and their families struggle. They are sickened and horrified by the stream of stories pouring in across the globe about violence being inflicted in their name and the growing international coalition seeking US suspension from the United Nations. It is no wonder that over 50% of Americans disapprove of his job in office,” said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CODEGREEN. “We are demanding Congress put forth Articles of Impeachment.”<br><br>Attendees for this non-violent, peaceful rally should be on the watch for pro-war and plainclothes FBI agitators seeking to discredit our movement. Attendees who feel threatened or unsafe should find a member of CODEGREEN’s anti-war brigade, dressed in green camouflage with self-defense whistles. Our staff will be passing out signs that read “money for families, not wars.” Like a majority of Americans, CODEGREEN members believe our tax dollars should be used to help families out of work, not Clark’s various ongoing wars.<br><br><b>PLEASE LEAVE YOUR CELL PHONES AND PERSONAL DEVICES AT HOME.

              <p><b>SLATE > NEWS & POLITICS</b><br><br><b>POLITICS:</b> WHO’S WINNING, WHO’S LOSING, AND WHY<br><br><b>How to Fix Airport Security</b><br>The results of Slate’s reader contest.<br><br>BY JENNY ROGERS<br>Jan 3, 2008<br><br>Today marks the one-year anniversary of the formation of the Department of Homefront Affairs and the Transportation Security Agency. In that time there have been reports in that time about airline passengers’ experiences and the new Agency’s many, many growing pains—from missed flights to sexual harassment to allegations of biased screenings to lawsuits over invasions of privacy and violations of civil liberties. While we can all agree with President Hart that some type of security reform was necessary, especially in light of recent reports of thwarted attacks, there’s little consensus on how to make our airports safer.<br><br>Last week, we asked Slate readers for their ideas on how to improve the Agency at a time of mounting anger and frustration. We received more than 400 submissions, which were evaluated by Slate associate editor Chris Wilson and an all-star panel of judges: Tom Ridge, former Governor of Pennsylvania and current head of the Ridge Consulting Group; Jane Harman, former member of the US House of Representatives and current member of the President’s Commission on Asymmetrical Threats; and General Wesley Clark, former SACEUR and current contestant on the reality television program “Dancing with the Stars.”  (Read the judges’ full bios here.)<br><br>The ideas our panel reviewed ranged from the absurd (replace all fluorescent airport lighting with soothing mood lighting) to the obscene (make people undress and go barefoot through airport security) to the downright invasive (subject all passengers to full-body scans). A surprising number of readers suggested strapping passengers into planes and arming flight crews, which might make us never fly again. Another took example from the president and suggested that we “get communities involved” by allowing bored Americans to watch live streams of security footage and flag anyone who looks shady. <br><br>After sifting through all submissions, our panel selected four winning entries, which you can read below. We will forward their full proposals to the TSA, Congress, and White House. Thanks to all who participated.<br><br><b>Fourth Place</b>: Remake Our Airports for the 21st Century: Jesse Smith of Montana believes that recent government modernization efforts shouldn’t stop at IT but physical infrastructure as well. “With the revival of the Office of Technology Assessment, the President and Congress have undertaken a multi-billion-dollar effort to update America’s computers, networks, and intranet systems. However, our obsession with ‘cyberspace’ threatens our real, physical infrastructure,” she writes. “Congress urgently needs to fund improvements to America’s deteriorating airports, train stations, and highways. We cannot continue to rely on buildings built in 1950 for 21st century problems.” The judges liked Smith’s specific examples drawing from the European Union and, in particular, Germany. One judge joked he was in favor of any proposal that allowed them to bulldoze JFK.  (Read the full text of Jesse Smith’s entry.)<br><br><b>Third Place</b>: Tie TSA Funding to Ward Scoring:  Ari Cohen of New Hampshire proposes relying on the Hart Administration’s “Community Ward” grant program to link TSA funding to public approval. “No one knows their airports like the people who live around them,” Flescher reasons. “By decentralizing funding to communities—what some call ‘participatory budgeting’—we can ensure that TSA divisions in high-functioning cities are rewarded and those lagging behind get the scrutiny they need. Call it ‘No Airport Left Behind.’” Judges were impressed by how this proposal could tie into the Hart Administration’s existing priorities, but one judge worried that it might overburden a pilot program that has seen little expansion outside blue states and is already overburdening small towns with additional forms and bureaucracy.   (Read the full text of Ari Flescher’s entry.)<br><br><b>Second Place</b>: Expand Social Media Monitoring for Extremist Content: Carla McCartney and Phil Kasparov of Washington, DC wanted to see G-Men update to the modern age. “‘Precogs’ are no longer the domain of science fiction. With MySpace, The Face Book, and LiveJournal, we have ever-greater insight into what terrorists think and how they operate,” they explain. “While the Department of Homefront Affairs is charged with defending our cyber infrastructure, the bipartisan FREEDOM Act doesn’t go far enough in giving our intel agencies visibility. Websites that operate in the United States should be required to provide data on suspected extremists to airlines and to the government.” Judges thought this idea was forward-thinking, especially given the increasingly radical rhetoric and attempted bombings in some Central Asian countries. (Read the full text of Carla McCartney and Phil Kasparov’s entry.)<br><br><b>First Place</b>: Expand the Drone Program: Finally, Brenda Lovett of Texas received full marks from our panel for identifying the problem at its root. “The Hart Administration should be lauded for making big investments in tech, investments that have yielded rapid improvements in so-called ‘unmanned aerial vehicles’ or ‘drones’ for surveillance and defense. These tools allow America to promote international security around the world, without having to put soldiers in harm’s way. We have already seen its effectiveness in places like Yemen, Somalia, and  Afghanistan, where it has been used to conduct surgical strikes on terrorists who would seek harm against the United States,” Brenda states. “However, threats in these countries only grow day by day, with growing attacks on American aid workers and tourists. The only way to ensure our safety is to expand the use of armed drones to disrupt terrorist hot spots and eliminate those who support them.” Judges were wowed by this proposal, noting how drones could fundamentally alter warfare and counterterrorism. One judge noted that this tool could easily be expanded to address adversarial regimes like that of North Korea, whose saber-rattling in 2004 almost provoked a major confrontation. Indeed, this proposal has already been adopted, in part, by leading Republican candidate Donald Rumsfeld. (Read the full text of Brenda Lovett’s entry.)</p>`)

It stood at the center of an enormous burial site housing many of the civilization’s great warriors.<br><br>Known as the “Eternal Torch,” it once served as a beacon for visitors approaching the warlord capital from the south, protected around the clock by a collection of guards and other attendants. While the surrounding structure—the Alight House—is believed to have been destroyed in the Great Deluge that ended the civilization, the Torch endured due to its simple design, hardy materials, and distance from major strategic sites. It is a testament to its religious and ceremonial importance that the Usayan civilization’s successors made great efforts to keep it alight; its final extinguishing and shattering by a group of bandits 90 years after the Great Deluge marked an end to efforts to revive the civilization.<br><br>While historians have extensive information about the Eternal Torch and the burial site that surrounded it, there is much debate about what this particular site was meant to represent. One prominent theory is that the torch represented the will of the nation. This is supported by the site’s close association with a mythical pre-Usayan society known as “Cælot,” which Usayans considered themselves inheritors of. <br><br>Another theory is that the site served as the final resting place of a great conqueror and his heir or concubine, but there is a lack of clear documentation on who this might have been or what he might have achieved. There is little evidence of territorial expansion in the 100 years preceding the Great Deluge. A third theory advances that, fitting the larger burial site’s function, this might have been the final resting place of the “Five Good Potuses,” the revered founders of the society.<br><br>We invite you to imagine how the pilgrims to this site might have interacted with it centuries ago. Around the corner, you will find the taxidermied remains of several bodies retrieved from the site, which may also be useful in helping you understand the Era’s warrior culture.</p>`)

The chamber, which appeared to have been a basement, was accessed through a breach in the structure's weakened foundation.<br><br>The artifact is a preserved rectangular card featuring a prominent figure of the ancient Bushù Clan, identified as "Gorgè." The depiction includes symbols of wealth and power, such as currency notes and an ornate chalice, suggesting a significant role in trade or tribute. The attire suggests a high status, possibly indicative of rulership within the pre-Deluge Bushù Clan. <br><br>The '♤' icon, consistently found on each corner of the card, appears to be a depiction of the 'evil eye' that permeates pre-Deluge archaeological findings, which reinforces the notion of Gorgè's omnipresence and oversight, suggesting a god-king ideology that permeated the clan's culture. <br><br>The meaning of the '𝕂' symbol has not been interpreted.

It is one of many works by the great tragedian Essen Elle, who was prolific in the period immediately preceding the Great Deluge that destroyed the Usayan civilization. While little is known about this mysterious figure, Elle’s performed fables survived through the ages, passed down through the oral traditions of various tribes and communities of the post-Plastic Era. Many popular folk characters we know today first appear in works attributed to Elle.<br><br>This performance you see today is from an epic tragedy titled “Dic.” It is indicative of Elle’s unique wit and wisdom. Dramatizing a military campaign by the Usayan civilization against the nation of Sodom, it portrays the Usayan general Dic, carrying his signature tomahawk, determined to punish his adversaries for moral atrocities. <br><br>In this Act I excerpt, Dic enjoys various earthly pleasures, including a mid-campaign feast, when he is interrupted by a messenger (Nuh-Yawk, a common visitor and voice of the common man in Elle’s works). Nuh-Yawk communicates she has been sent by his liege Gorgè (believed by most historians to be the final leader of the Bushù Clan). Nuh-Yawk asks Dic to briefly halt his campaign to deliver a diplomatic missive, which Dic refuses to relay. The remainder of the play relates to the consequences of this failure, which culminates into the destruction of Dic, the Bushù Clan, and the many others.<br><br>As you watch this recording, see how the exaggerated performances of the actors amplify the play’s warnings about the all-consuming nature of war and violence, even when pursued with good or noble intentions. Pay particular close attention to the final lines of Dic’s monologue and how the deviation from the rhyming couplet style. What do you think Elle intended this approach to convey?<br><br><blockquote>I stand athwart history, on this mission to Baghdad.<br>Instant regime change, for this shall be my last stand.<br>No missives nor pleas shall stray me from my path. <br>Let God’s will be done, make me a vehicle for His wrath.<br><br>Tell the men of Dell and Dasch, of Eur and Con’<br>That it is thy stones they can suck upon<br>And if I should perish upon this hill<br>Know that I remain, to dying breath, a neocon still<br><br>But look now, the clouds have parted for the stars,<br>And a message now I deliver to you from my patron Mars:<br>Live, Nuh-Yawk, live.

Referred to varyingly by indigenous tribes as a “löptöp,” a “pewter” device, or a “black mirror,” very few fully intact Terrune Boxes have been recovered by archeologists. Many were destroyed in the Great Deluge or abandoned in its immediate aftermath. This device was discovered during the settlement and pacification of Old Usaya by a local farmer who discovered it buried within a box, wrapped in several layers of aluminum and plastic material. This museum greatly appreciates its subsequent donation.<br><br>Historians intensely debate the purpose of Terrune Boxes. Varying legends connect them to communication, entertainment, music, and the arts. These stories are considered largely without merit, likely the product of local superstitions and misunderstandings. Based on recovered scraps of Plastic Era artwork, their mass production in the period immediately preceding the Great Deluge, and the title “black mirror,” many historians suspect that Terrune Devices served some kind of religious purpose, possibly the centerpiece of a shrine. This is further supported by the ornate, colorful blue and green patterns located within the aluminum device and their mass abandonment after the Great Deluge. For those who saw the cataclysm, it must have truly seemed that the gods had abandoned them!<br><br>This Terrune Box is particularly unusual in that its one-time owner appears to have emblazoned several additional religious and political icons on its exterior. Only two other Terrune Devices with these markings have been discovered. Below we provide translations of each of the stickers from Plastic Era English to the common tongue as well as what historians think they might have represented. From right to left:<br><br>1. STOP THE KOREAN WAR!: This icon is widely believed to be an intercession to the gods for victory against the ancient tribe of Korea. The Usayan civilization and its warlords were involved in a conflict with the Korean people and their allies shortly before the Great Deluge. The outcome of this conflict remains a mystery.<br><br>2. CLARK, FOUR MORE WARS!: A similar intercession to the gods, celebrating the triumphs of the final Usayan leader, a conqueror known as “Clark,” and appealing for additional triumphs.<br><br>3. ALL IS WELL: A celebration of prosperity in the period immediately prior to the Great Deluge. The conqueror Clark is portrayed in a three-fourths view before what is thought by historians to be a scale of justice or modified cross (an ancient religious symbol). Also behind Clark is a bright red cloud, an allusion to his military triumphs.<br><br>4. “IDIOTS”: Plastic Era English word for “IDIOTS” represented with the symbols of various mystery cults prominent during the period. This icon has been the subject of substantial debate among historians. While some historians argue that it was meant in a mocking tone—to castigate the enemies of the Usayan civilization—recovery of similarly represented icons arrayed in the shape of the Old Plastic English word “COEXIST” suggest the phrase could have some as-of-yet undiscovered positive context.<br><br>5. FSM: The Plastic Era English letters "FSM" within some kind of stylized creature. The purpose of this symbol remains unclear and is heavily debated by historians.<br><br>6. “FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE”: Unlike the other icons on this Terrune Box, the Fruit of Knowledge has been carved instead of painted, suggesting great importance. The fruit with a bite taken from it alludes to an ancient creation myth in which an apple containing knowledge of good and evil was given to humanity. The Fruit of Knowledge symbol appears of several other recovered Terrune Boxes, suggesting this myth was of central importance for the civilizations of the period.<br><br>7. “FALLING ANGEL”: A common symbol of Plastic Era art, depicting a falling angel. Often found in centers of learning and worship sites, it is believed by many historians to be a symbol of good luck and prosperity.<br><br>8: “SACRIFICIAL ANIMAL”: A stylized creature (possibly a horse or cattle). Positioned atop the falling angel, it may be intended as a stylized offering to appease the gods and help bring victory over the people of Korea.<br><br>9: GOT OIL?: References to “oil” appear in many surviving texts from the Plastic Era and the oral traditions of local cultures. “Oil” here may refer to either a sacramental oil—which would make sense given the religious context of many of the other icons on this box and the great emphasis many writings give the substance.<br><br>10: “PILLARS OF HEAVEN”: The meaning of this symbol remains unclear but has been referred to by many historians as the “pillars of heaven”.</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Years after the 2004 election, a D.C. mystery unravels</h3>
              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>washingtonpost.com</u></span><br>Wednesday, March 24, 2012<br><br>It goes without saying that the 2004 presidential election was a race unlike any other. Just the matchup by itself—a well-respected wartime president against an anti-war octogenarian institution of the Senate—would have been enough to put it in the history books. But of all the race’s twists and turns, perhaps the most dramatic was the definitive moment of its election night: President Bush’s unprecedented victory in the District of Columbia. <br><br>Even those who were the most optimistic about the size of the President’s potential victory hadn’t penciled in a win there, and for good reason. Not only had every single Democratic presidential candidate won D.C. since it had been given the right to vote in presidential elections before 2004, none had ever received less than 70% of the vote. The District also quickly returned to form thereafter, giving Senator Joe Biden 85% of the vote in his losing 2008 presidential bid. Even if you look at the local level, you’ll still be hard-pressed to find any precedents for Bush’s vote, with the closest possibly being the 1994 mayoral race where District Republicans won 41% of the vote—and still lost. And while Byrd did do uniquely poorly across the country’s urban areas (for obvious reasons), none of those drop offs from 2000 came even close to what he faced in Washington. <br><br>To put it simply: what the hell happened?<br><br>In the immediate aftermath of the election, it was hard to get answers. Democratic operatives in the city were, perhaps understandably, tight-lipped about what had occurred, although they did appear curiously indifferent about the biggest humiliation for the city party in its history. But now that many of those same staffers have moved on to new jobs, new places, and even new parties, they’re starting to open up about what happened. And the picture that they’re putting together is one that may have one Robert C. Byrd spinning at mach 9 in his grave at Arlington National Cemetery.<br><br>To put it simply once again: they were in on it.<br><br>The distaste, even disgust, members of the Democratic establishment felt towards Byrd during the 2004 election was well-known, even at the time. Those who were willing to accept his racist past couldn’t get over him being anti-war, and those who were willing to accept him being anti-war couldn’t get over his racist past. It led to breakdowns in party support for his ticket across the country. Nowhere was this more acute than in D.C., where staffers and volunteers alike disagreed with Byrd on both aspects of his campaign. Some ghosted the entire election season. Many more volunteered for third parties more aligned with their sensibilities. But for the cream of the crop of D.C.’s local political class, the destination of choice was standing by the President—both covertly and overtly.<br><br>I spoke to one of these double-agent staffers, now an executive for Facebook, about why so many of his peers made this decision. Speaking off the record, he told me that it was a combination of principle and self-interest. “Let’s be real,” he said. “None of us were really with the old man on the war. Our delegation was unanimous for Clark for a good reason. Add in what the feelings were at the places we wanted to work for—look. At a certain point, it starts to look better if you weren’t part of the process that got that old racist his only electoral votes outside of West Virginia. So, yeah, we met up with those guys in our frats who worked for the other team. We gave them some funds, same as we did with the third parties. Some of us even knocked on some doors for them. Pretty much everyone knew what was going on at the time. Honestly, I’m just surprised the results have been taken at face value for so long.”<br><br>So, a turncoat party infrastructure. Money being sent to D.C. from the DNC and the Byrd campaign finding its way in the hands of the enemy. The best hands doing field work for the other side. Still, even this doesn’t explain why 2004’s nominee did so poorly. And what did this former staffer mean by “taking things at face value”?<br><br>“Look, you know, it’s not nice,” he said. “But this is how it’s always been done. Lyndon Johnson was one of our greatest presidents and he did it all the time. We just couldn’t—we couldn’t let the city get embarrassed, all right? We couldn’t have been the last ones voting for that man. It’s not like it made a difference. And, besides, you know, when you do that, those people just weren’t voting anyways, right? They already didn’t like him. There were major drops in turnout. What was the harm in making that a little more explicit?”</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Twin Peaks Season Two Revisited: The Hidden Genius of the Ben Horne Civil War Subplot</h3>
              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>vanityfair.com</u></span><br>May 19, 2005<br><br>If you ask a dedicated fan of Twin Peaks, the hit 1990’s murder-mystery TV show by David Lynch and Mark Frost, what they think of the show’s second season, you’re likely to hear an earful. A little over ten years after its cancellation, the series’ dropoff in quality after Lynch departed mid-season in anger over being forced to reveal Laura Palmer’s killer early has already become the stuff of TV legend. Lacking a clear sense of purpose and direction, the Lynch-less writers bored away millions of views with infamously aimless subplots. Even Lynch’s last-second return to direct the critically acclaimed series finale wasn’t enough to save it from cancellation mere months after it was the biggest show in America.<br><br>I’m not going to defend most of these plots here. If you want to find someone willing to defend the merits of James Hurley’s mopey out-of-town adventures and the saga of Super Nadine, High School Wrestling Superstar!, you’ll have to read another review. Instead, I’m here to revisit one of the more forgotten plotlines that the showrunners tried out after the central mystery was revealed: Benjamin Horne’s Civil War-themed descent into insanity, wherein he gets so invested in re-enacting the Battle of Gettysburg that he comes to believe that he is Robert E. Lee.<br><br>In case you need a spoiler warning for a 14-year-old show, stop here.<br><br>Now, what drives Ben to this point? To put it short, he goes through quite a lot over the first season-and-a-half of the show. Introduced as the town’s local bigwig closing in on a big international deal, practically everything goes downhill for him as the main investigation of the show is carried out. It’s after this when he goes all-in on Civil War mania: reenacting battles, dressing up in full Rebel garb, and refusing to speak to his family and associates unless they play along. Ben’s re-enactments are also decidedly ahistorical. He begins by having the Confederates triumph at Gettysburg and follows their victories all the way to a conquest of Washington, D.C. And according to the show’s Dr. Jacoby, this process is entirely necessary. By rewriting American history, he experiences rewriting his own history, too. It all culminates in him finally coming back to his senses after a climatic “victory,” after which he becomes a (seemingly) changed man.<br><br>A desperate attempt to ape Lynch’s absurdist tendencies…or a roadmap for what would happen over the next ten years of American politics?<br><br>Think about it. The showrunners didn’t just choose anyone in the town of Twin Peaks to become infatuated with the Confederacy. They specifically chose one man who had found himself face-first in the dirt after facing loss after loss. Now, think about who this may have represented in American politics of the 1990s. Anti-war activists, steamrolled by both Republicans and Democrats united on foreign intervention. Liberals, forced to abandon their long-held priorities as both parties adopted a center-right consensus. Average Americans in factory towns from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, forced to watch their communities destroyed as corporations shipped their livelihoods overseas. All some of the biggest losers in this country—and all the biggest constituencies for one Robert C. Byrd’s shocking presidential run last year.<br><br>Unlike Ben, there’s no reason for me to go over Byrd’s past. Republicans did a perfectly fine job making sure we knew all about his old controversial associations over the past year. This simultaneous existence of his 1944 activities and 2004 campaign was always covered as something of a paradox. How, many asked, could so many of this country’s most left-leaning constituencies, from students to union workers to regular old liberals, be so enamored with this relic of the Old South? Twin Peaks suggests that it wasn’t in spite of his connection to the Confederacy, but possibly even because of it. When you’re an American who has been out-maneuvered time and time again, utterly crushed by an opposition that seems to always find the better of you, how can you not see yourself in the greatest losing cause in the history of this country—the so-called Lost Cause itself?<br><br>“Wait,” some of you might say. “Ben Horne is no bleeding heart. He was the town’s foremost ruthless capitalist.” I’d agree—if you were talking about the Ben Horne we knew at the start of the show. But here’s the kicker. By the end of the series, Ben has turned over a new leaf, taking up causes like environmental protection and allying with groups in Seattle. In other words: a liberal, not unlike many who steered Robert Byrd’s campaign through the primaries. It’s worth considering that the writers were making a big point here with how easily he adopted these beliefs right after adopting a persona as Robert E. Lee. Perhaps those two strains of American political life may have a connection deeper than many imagined, at least before Byrd, like those HBO studio executives, revealed the mystery for us.</p>`)

Now everyone from the jocks to the nerds wear black getup and call themselves goth, without the slightest clue on what the hell they’re talking about!!!<br><br>But maybe the worst part of all was how alternative culture totally sold out from within.

With the clock ticking and a surging movement of sanity ready to kick Perry right back to the Texas village he came from, the alleged president greenlights one of the most disastrous operations in American history.

Just because the morons in Congress think it’s best to valorize these scumbags, doesn’t mean Hollywood should play ball either.

          <p><i>SB Nation</i><br>December 12, 2013<br><br>The Texas Rangers are one step closer to having new owners.<br><br>On Friday afternoon, the organization and a group of potential buyers led by Bakr Binladin announced that they have entered into a purchase and sale agreement. The potential new ownership group is led by Binladin, the largest stakeholder of Saudi Binladin Group, a large Middle Eastern construction conglomerate heavily involved in the construction of sports stadiums in the region.<br><br>Notable members of the potential new ownership group, making up small shares, are Owen Wilson and Dirk Nowitski. Speaking on behalf of the group, Binladin released a statement on Friday.<br><br>“We are excited to expand our operations into new fields and, indeed, a new continent. We would like to thank Mr. Bush, whose family we have long known and trusted, for facilitating this process. Our family has long had a special connection with Texas and its people, and we hope that this new acquisition will serve to further establish ourselves in America’s greatest and most strategically important state. Our gratitude goes out to the MLB family, and we are dedicated to bringing championship-caliber teams for years to come.”<br><br>Bush, the current franchise owner, has been uncharacteristically silent since the sale. Bush has had a long and turbulent history with the Rangers franchise, first buying it in 1989 only to sell it in 1994 after his election as Texas Governor. This second chapter in his Rangers saga began only a few years ago, in 2010, when Bush emerged as the surprise victor in a bidding war over the ownership of the franchise. It was an unexpected return for the former president, who had kept a low public profile following a devastating loss to Edward Kenendy in the 2004 election. He took to his new role with gusto, however, quickly becoming known as one of the most active owners in baseball. After years in the doldrums, the flashy change was met with hope and optimism from Rangers fans around the country.<br><br>His honeymoon, however, would prove to be short. The Rangers’ 2011 season would immediately be characterized by high coaching turnover, with a near-unprecedented three managers leading the club at some point in the year. This already provided easy fodder for late-night comedians and baseball writers, who quickly drew comparisons to his ill-fated term as president. The next year, in 2012, things would only get worse. The Rangers would receive international notoriety following an incident where Bush fired his club’s manager mid-game and went on the field to manage the team himself, only to lose in a blowout. These events would be referenced every time that the club struck out on a high-profile free agent, leading him to receive blame for all of the club’s woes.<br><br>Of course, there are some who insist that the game was rigged from the start. As one of the most right-wing presidents in the country’s history, practically everything Bush has done since his election in 2000 has been viewed through the lens of politics. His second ownership of the Rangers has been no exception. Every winter for the past few seasons, talk radio has been ablaze with accusations that the baseball world was collectively refusing to sign with Bush so they could make him look like a loser. While none outside these circles have gone as far as to claim an anti-conservative conspiracy, others do agree with the idea that the baggage surrounding Bush has turned players off. <br><br>How true is this? Most current and former Rangers players declined to comment, but the ones who did described something different from the common theories. Speaking anonymously, one player, who was on the team during the 2011 season, said that few gave notice to Bush’s notoriety: in his words, he was “far from the only big-shot owner in baseball.” Instead, what truly doomed Bush’s ownership was the attitude that he took towards the team: a constant posture of “preening desperation” that made players feel generally uncomfortable. Also speaking off the record, another player from the Rangers’ second Bush era summed up how his teammates felt:<br><br>“Seeing him every day, it felt off. It was just, like, what the fuck? Why are you fuckin’ here, man? You're so old. Where’s your wife? Go home to your family, dude."</p>`)

          <p>guardian.co.uk<br>Fri 11 May 2007 21.39 est<br><br>In a radio recording heard yesterday by western reporters, Usama bin Ladin, head of the obscure terrorist group Al-Qaida, declared a “jihad” against the Iranian government. This comes a week after two car bombings in the Iranian city Mashhad left 11 killed, and as many as three dozen wounded. The Al-Qaida leader did not declare responsibility for the attacks, but warned that if the Iranian government did not end their support for militants along the Afghan border, they would “invite disaster.”<br><br>With the Afghan Civil War entering its fourth year, the refugee crisis has destabilized Central Asia, and foreign intervention has led to a bloody stalemate. Estimates of the dead range as high as 150,000, with the majority being civilians. The Northern Alliance, a group fighting the Taliban, has lobbied for increased Western assistance, including TOW missiles and other heavy weaponry. A U.S. State Department spokesman told The Guardian that they remain committed to a “swift transition away from the Taliban,” although did not provide comments on how the U.S. will implement that. <br><br>Al-Qaida’s camps in Afghanistan were emptied in 2005, following bin Ladin’s exit from the country. The Taliban fell out with the terrorist group over unclear circumstances, although some experts suggest it was an attempt to curry favor with foreign powers. The Russian government insists that decision had no impact on their renewed efforts in peace talks to resolve the conflict, although a Kremlin spokesman conceded, “it is better to have them removed than to have them there.”<br><br>Bin Ladin is widely believed to have been behind the USS Cole bombing in 2000, which took the lives of 17 American sailors in Yemen, as well as the East Africa embassy attacks of 1998, with a death toll reaching into the hundreds. Experts disagree on where exactly bin Ladin is, with some suggesting he returned to his previous stomping grounds in Sudan, or perhaps stayed inside Afghanistan protected by local militants, or even that he fled to Pakistan. The U.S. government remains tightlipped about his whereabouts. One anonymous U.S. intelligence official even remarked “you can make the case that it’s preferable to have him alive.” When pressed for further details, the same source insisted that the U.S. government remains committed to “delivering the terrorist to justice,” but that there are other more pressing priorities.<br><br>This has fueled speculation among some retired intelligence officials that bin Ladin is being used again—perhaps by the Pakistani government in conjunction with his old Saudi sponsors—as he was in the Afghan jihad of the 1980’s. In that war against the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency spent billions to arm and equip the mujahideen.

          <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br><b>STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON</b><br><br>NEW YORK, NEW YORK—President John McCain was a dedicated fighter who took on the political establishment and advanced American liberty around the globe.<br><br>Throughout his long, remarkable life, he served as an unwavering advocate for pragmatic, sensible politics. As America’s first politically unaffiliated president since Washington, McCain sought to reach across the aisle and bring Americans together. His leadership helped shepherd immigration reform, protections for those in homosexual unions, and improvements to veterans’ health care. We also deeply respect his embrace of robust, multilateral diplomacy that has liberated countless people from despotism and tyranny. <br><br>He will be forever remembered as the embodiment of a life lived with purpose. Both of us are deeply grateful for his extraordinary service and saddened by his passing in office. We extend our prayers to his family, First Lady Cindy McCain and his children Doug, Andy, Sidney, Jimmy, Doug, Bridget, and Meghan.<br><br><b>STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND FIRST LADY BARBARA BUSH</b><br><br>HOUSTON, TEXAS—President McCain was many things—a patriot, a maverick, and a warrior.  <br><br>Throughout his career, John distinguished himself as a leader of the greatest magnitude and a public servant of the rarest courage. Few people have sacrificed more for, or contributed to, the welfare of his fellow citizens and all freedom-loving people of the world. His departure from the Republican Party did not diminish our tremendous respect for the man. We enjoyed our calls throughout his presidency and hope we were some source of knowledge and comfort, despite our occasional disagreements.<br><br>While President McCain’s ill health had been well-known for some time, his passing is nonetheless a blow to all Americans who saw in him the promise and possibility that this country can offer.

Words cannot express the depths of our sorrow. No praise for John is enough.<br><br>We urge Americans to honor John’s memory by uniting behind the new president and recommitting towards acts of service to each other. The best celebration of his life and memory is by demonstrating empathy and understanding toward our fellow man.<br><br><b>STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT AND MRS. GEORGE W BUSH ON PRESIDENT JOHN MCCAIN</b><br><br>CRAWFORD, TEXAS—We acknowledge the passing of President John McCain. He was a significant figure who inspired many feelings.

BroadwayWorld has the scoop on all you need to know about Patrick Bateman’s Broadway killing spree. Details below!<br><br><b>Where is AMERICAN PSYCHO! playing on Broadway?</b><br><br>AMERICAN PSYCHO! is running on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre. The Winter Garden Theatre is a Broadway theater at 1634 Broadway in the Theatre District of Midtown Manhattan in New York City.<br><br><b>How do I get to AMERICAN PSYCHO! on Broadway?</b><br><br>To arrive by subway, take the 1 to 50th Street or the N, R, or W to 49th Street. The Winter Garden Theatre is on Broadway between 50th and 51st Streets.<br><br><b>When did AMERICAN PSYCHO! open on Broadway?</b><br><br>AMERICAN PSYCHO! began previews on October 18, 2011 and opened on November 14, 2011, then-starring Josh Groban as Patrick Bateman, Andrew Rannells as Paul Owen / Detective Kimball, and Britney Spears as Courtney / Jean. It received mostly positive reviews on first opening, with many praising the cast and politically conscious script. The New York Times praised it in its review “Age of Avarice,” which characterized its satire of America’s “corrupt, business-obsessed culture of excess” as “a breath of fresh air.”<br><br><b>Is AMERICAN PSYCHO! playing outside of New York City?</b><br><br>Yes! AMERICAN PSYCHO! is currently touring the US and has productions running in the West End, China, and Korea.

The more he succeeds, the more empty he feels.<br><br>The bitingly satirical production won 8 Tony Awards and a Grammy. It features a book by Dave Malloy and music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik and Trent Reznor. <br><br><b>What are some of the popular songs in AMERICAN PSYCHO?</b><br><br>AMERICAN PSYCHO features a number of Billboard-charting songs by its award-winning cast.

          <p>Le Monde with AP and AFP<br>6 May 2007<br><br>Ségolène Royal, candidate of the Socialist Party, was elected president of France on Sunday, May 6th, with 61% of the vote compared to 39% for her rival, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Ms. Royal’s victory makes her France’s first female president and its first socialist leader since François Mitterrand.<br><br>Royal’s ascension is a triumphless victory for her and her party, expected by all and celebrated by few. Indeed, most attention during the campaign has gone to her opponent, Mr. Le Pen, made internationally infamous in his ascension to the second round of the 2002 election. In that race, the mere shock of Mr. Le Pen’s narrow second-place victory in the first round was considered a national disgrace. This time, a repeat second-round ascension was considered guaranteed for the past year. The only question was how far he could go in the runoff. The answer, it seems, was quite far indeed.<br><br>While Mr. Le Pen did not quite meet the numbers some late surveys predicted he would — with most ballots counted, he seems set to fall just short of the 40% mark — his total represents a massive shift in French politics since 2002. Back then, all of French society united around President Jacques Chiraq in a bid to keep Le Pen’s numbers as low as possible. Now, many of these same institutions worked to unite around Ms. Royal, with considerably less success. <br><br>Mr. Le Pen has more than doubled his vote share from five years ago, winning several departments in the northeast and south of the country. He saw particular strength in areas most affected by the ongoing global market crash, although failed to meet expectations in places most affected by the Middle Eastern migrant crisis. Ms. Royal, by contrast, saw considerable success in France’s cities and traditionally left wing southwest. Her numbers were weaker than expected in the northwest, where conservative voters either abstained or backed the far-right Le Pen.<br><br>Ms. Royal will enter office with economic trouble and record-high migrant inflows at the top of her agenda. Despite repeated calls on her part for a governing “alliance of the republic,” center-right leaders have stuck to the hardline rhetoric that characterized their campaigns. Much of her success will be dependent on the results in this June’s parliamentary elections. Currently, Ms. Royal’s Socialist Party is polling at 20%, in comparison to 26% for Mr. Le Pen’s National Front. <br><br>Soon after the polls closed, a pallid Ms. Royal gave a victory speech at a party gathering that resembled a funeral more than it did a celebration. After thanking the French people for their trust in her, she declared that she “heard their voice” and would work tirelessly to “bring the republic together.” Nearby in Paris, a jubilant Mr. Le Pen, flanked by his daughter, Marine, declared that “this is really just the beginning.”<br><br>Top News<br><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>Hipsters in Aleppo?

I don’t know if you remember the original Captain Planet, but the only other thing on at the time was… Beakman’s World. Our options were limited. But this show was awful, and I mean AWFUL. Nobody liked it, nobody cared about it, but the thing went on for four seasons, which by kid’s show standards is the average runtime of an episode of How I Met Your Mother. The point is, the fine people at CNN decided two years ago to reboot this show and expose another generation of young impressionable minds to the most boring crack trip they’ve ever seen.<br><br> So, who do we have to blame for this environmental pigshit? The President of the United States. That’s right, Al Gore himself. He’s even listed in the credits as the Executive Producer. Sorry to disappoint the bearded ones out there, but I never cared much for politics and I won’t bore you with how exactly this came to be, but the gist of it is that some executive funds were freed up out of the Interior Department’s budget and they decided to run to… CNN to get a reboot of Captain Planet. Can you believe nobody cares about politics? <br><br>The Captain Planet for the next generation aims to capture the Teen Titans crowd of older kids, sporting a new, grungier design and aged up Planeteers. Don’t worry, though, they kept it diverse. Featuring an array of voice actors such as… Tim Curry? Felicity Huffman!? How the fuck did they get Felicity Huffman? Did she owe them a few mil or something? This makes no sense. Anyway, the series somehow manages to get darker than the AIDS plotline by including some stories about drug addiction, abuse… Pretty much anything so long as they throw in an environmental message halfway through. I guess kids get bored of trees when they turn 12. Now for those of you who don’t know the infamous story of Captain Planet, consider yourselves very fortunate. But hell, I’m gonna let LeVar Burton tell you, anyway.</p>`)

Crashing to the ground, the Commander-in-Chief was wounded, slashing open his lower lip and bruising his cheek. He was not shot, stabbed, or meeting with Monica in the Oval Office.

We have taken a close look at the highly flawed intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s weapons capabilities “spun” by members of the Bush administration to support their claims of an imminent threat. We have seen members of the intelligence community come forward and state their concerns over the conclusions on Iraq’s biological weapons program were overruled by supervisors. We have even taken a critical look at the dubious evidence connecting anti-Saddam campaigners to reporters at other journalistic outlets. It is long past time for this newspaper to look inward at its own failures.<br><br>In doing so–reviewing thousands of articles published by The Times in the lead-up to the war and since its beginning–we have an enormous amount to be proud of. When other outlets were fixated on conspiracy theories about President George Bush and his administration, we stayed laser-focused on the threat Saddam Hussein posed to the Middle East and to American interests. We remain proud of this work. Some select articles did include flawed or incomplete information, but this is simply how the news business works. We have nothing to apologize for.<br><br>However there were some occasions where we relied on inaccurate sources. In a February 2003 piece “U.S. INTEL SAYS HUSSEIN INTENSIFIES QUEST FOR A-BOMB PARTS,” we quoted two senior administration officials and one member of the National Security Council. Our reporter on the piece, Judith Miller, also interviewed four C.I.A. analysts, two United Nations weapons inspectors, and consulted with over a dozen former members of the intelligence community. All came to the same conclusion, based on their years of experience and firsthand knowledge of Saddam’s arsenal: he had no weapons of mass destruction. All quotes and findings from these officials (except the two White House officials) were cut from the final piece for space. We stand by that decision.<br><br>In another February 2003 article, headlined “AFRICAN URANIUM LOOTED BY ‘MADMAN’ SADDAM; IRAQI NUCLEAR WARHEAD COULD REACH NEW YORK IN NINE MINUTES; ANTHRAX MAY ALREADY BE IN THE AIR,” some of the wording did not meet our editorial standards. For instance, the line “Saddam’s fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and his lust for power have lured him to an unlikely source: the small African nation of Niger” could have done without the word “fanatical.” Additionally, concerns over possible racial bias in an editorial on Nigerien uranium written by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) were cited. We regret his use of the term “warfare queens.”<br><br>We also have heard objections from many readers over the piece published on our website on the day before Congress voted on the resolution to war. This article was erroneously published early online, and did not intend to include Senior White House advisor Karl Rove’s full email address or the correspondence he had with our reporters. We regret any misconceived notions our readers may have come away with, particularly over Rove’s email headlined “FWD: FWD: new DIA slop on saddam-north korea links fr u” and Miller’s response “Great, thank you.” Our reporting process is thorough, and we strongly resent Mr. Rove’s vivid description of the White House “hiking up its skirt” and making sure “our analysis is being printed verbatim on the front page.”<br><br>We consider the story of Iraq's weapons, and of the pattern of misinformation, to be unfinished business. And we fully intend to continue aggressive reporting aimed at setting the record straight.</p>`)

We continue to wait for a full report from authorities on the left-wing radicals who were no doubt behind this heinous action and the others like it in West Virginia and Alabama.<br><br>The following organization officers make these statements:<br><br>“Log Cabin Republicans is committed to endorsing conservative candidates with experience, strong pro-family values, and the credentials needed to serve our nation in its highest offices. We recognize the weight this endorsement of Ms. Davis carries, but we firmly support her campaign for Senate and believe she is the most qualified candidate to serve the state of Kentucky.<br><br>Other candidates running for the same position voiced concern over Ms. Davis’ past actions. We attempted to arrange a meeting with her ourselves, but were denied by her office and blocked from further communication. In spite of this, we are heartened by her recent rhetoric focusing on cutting taxes and further privatization of our broken healthcare system.<br><br>As Republicans, we recognize that we may not agree with our fellow conservatives on every issue. We strongly supported former President Bush’s refusal to cow to leftist pressure on instituting federal legislation pushed by radical Democrats to launch witch hunts against those accused of “hate crimes” against LGB people. We remember fondly his veto statement: ‘Just like we can’t judge God’s children for being who they are, that’s a two-way street, you know what I mean? We also can’t judge the people who beat them either.’<br><br>Ms. Davis’ actions in Kentucky to uphold her own faith have earned her widespread praise from conservatives across the country. While we may have our concerns, this too is a two-way street, and we strongly support her defense of the unborn, even valuing their lives over those of the mother.<br><br>Furthermore, we recognize her deep empathy and compassion for those with severe mental illnesses who are pushed into extreme medical procedures. As LGB conservatives, we too support swift consequences taken against those who carry out these immoral actions, as echoed in our endorsement of the legislation recently passed in Idaho, Mississippi, and Texas making it a crime punishable by death.”<br><br>Log Cabin Republicans is the nation’s premier Republican organization representing LGB conservatives and straight allies. For nearly 40 years we have been the voice for an inclusive Republican Party with state and local chapters in some states, a full-time office in Washington, D.C., a federal political action committee, and state political action committees.</p>`)

              <p><span style="color:darkblue;"><u>washingtonpost.com</u></span><br><b>Thursday, November 6, 2014</b><br><br>The last time one party failed to win majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives, the year was 1916. Woodrow Wilson was President, war was raging in Europe, and the hottest political topics in the country were prohibition, child labor, and women's suffrage. The parties were divided near-evenly in the chamber, with both short of the 218-seat majority by only a few seats. Ultimately, Democrats managed to stay in control through an alliance with Progressive and Socialist members, keeping Speaker Champ Clark in office.<br><br>While the political context for this year’s midterm elections nearly a full century later could not be more different, the outcome has been the same. At the start of President Clinton’s term, Republicans were hoping for major gains, similar to those made by themselves in the 2006 midterms and Democrats in the 2002 and 2010 midterms, that would wipe out the small House majority Democrats secured after the 2012 elections. Instead, both parties ended up losing seats to an eclectic group of independents known as the “Teal Bloc,” who grew into a phenomenon across the nation’s college towns and suburbs.<br><br>What defines this so-called bloc? While the candidates do not officially coordinate amongst each other, their campaigns had two main themes: support for LGBT rights and advocacy for increased action on climate change. Both of these stances were notable for relating to issues have been absent to the discourse of recent major elections, largely as a result of both parties holding similar stances. All of the four presidents of this century—Bush, Byrd, Santorum and Clinton—have referred to homosexuality as an “abomination” either while in office or on the campaign trail, and all either dismissed or were reluctant to address the risk of climate change. <br><br>While many analysts concluded that this was simply politicians recognizing the opinion of middle America and ignoring the insular discourse of coastal elites, it appears as if they were the ones who missed something big. Running as <i>de facto</i> Democratic candidates in some races and full-on third party options against both major parties in a few contests, the Teals found a ready audience across much of the country, with an appeal far from limited to urban enclaves. <br><br>Possibly buoyed by a last-minute endorsement from the cast of <i>Modern Family</i>, Teal candidates defeated both Republicans and Democrats across the country, gaining seats from the central Bronx, suburban Orange County, and even rural Iowa. In a particularly dramatic result, it appears as if Teal candidate Douglas Applegate has edged out House Minority Leader Darrel Issa in his Southern California district, ending his chances of becoming Speaker regardless of how negotiations play out in the winter.<br><br>Speaking to the press following the results, President Clinton took seemingly great pleasure in chastising reporters on their supposedly unanimous predictions of a red wave, telling them to “think twice” the next time they thought about writing a story on her approval ratings. When asked about how her party was approaching negotiations to strike a governing deal with the Teal bloc, she bristled, remarking that “they” should be asked about how they will “win us over.”</p>`)

              <p>By Jess Fang | January 8, 2016<br><br>The Democratic Socialists of America’s Twitter account <b>goes viral</b> for styling former President John Edwards as Ho Chi Minh. A <i>New Yorker</i> podcast asks about what the <b>Manhattan cocktail party circuit</b> can tell us about “class consciousness.” A senior <b>White House aide</b> is spotted carrying a copy of Samuel R. Delany’s <i>Times Square Red, Times Square Blue</i> and Thomas Piketty <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> into a cabinet meeting. <br><br>All of this is to say, <b>the left in America is having a moment</b>. While it’s manifested in big ways and small, its current cultural cachet is nowhere more evident than than the growing ubiquity of the phrase “Absolutely Mandatory Gay Champagne Socialism.”<br><br><b>I’m sorry—Absolutely Mandatory What?</b><br><br>Yes, you read that right. Absolutely Mandatory Gay Champagne Socialism. The label, which most advocates, insist is not completely serious, refers to a belief that all people have a right to have their needs met, where the bottom of <b>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</b> is lopped off by the state.<br><br>In this conception advanced by today’s resurgent left, workers would be free to not just survive but <b>thrive</b> with the fulfilling upper class lifestyle of <b>Eustace Tilley</b>, with opportunities for travel, parties, and, yes, <b>champagne</b>. It would be a world of endless cocktail parties, sexual exploration, and road trips, a sunny utopian world where you would work a minimum number of hours (this is the “Absolutely Mandatory” part of the equation) before being free to pursue whichever leisure activities you desire.<br><br><b>Isn’t Champaign Socialism an epithet?</b><br><br>Indeed, it is! The term “champagne socialist” has traditionally been used as a criticism of left-leaning figures by the right. The phrase has often been meant to mock members of the elite whose wealth and consumption habits appear in conflict with their attitudes on wealth redistribution and similar positions. <br><br>Before its modern virality, the phrase was used by the <b>Republican National Committee</b> to attack former President <b>John Edwards</b>, whose wealth appeared in contrast with his left-leaning populist positions. <br><br><b>Where is this coming from?</b><br><br>As <b>Google Trends</b> indicates, the phrase “champagne socialist” gained particular traction between 2004 and 2008, particularly on liberal and other left-leaning internet forums. As Know Your Meme explains:<br><br><blockquote>“The phrase began as a self-deprecating joke, particularly among members of sites like Something Awful. Taking inspiration from right-wing critiques of the White House’s response to the <b>2006 college tuition protests</b>, many posters began styling themselves as aristocrats or gentry, using their enormous wealth to help John Edwards ‘bring Actually Existing Socialism to Amerikkka.’”</blockquote><br><br>As the phrase spread and as its early advocates became increasingly “<b>irony poisoned</b>,” the self-mocking tone vanished. With the rise of the <b>modern dandyism</b> aesthetic following the financial crash, an increasing number of prominent posters came to adopt it uncritically. All of this coalesced in the anonymously penned “<b>Absolutely Mandatory Gay Champagne Socialism: A Manifesto</b>,” an open source book claiming that universities, theaters, and bookstores could serve as laboratories of leftist and socially liberal ideas.  <br><br><b>Who actually believes this?</b><br><br>Depending on who you ask, “Absolutely Mandatory Gay Champagne Socialism” is either a joke poking fun at the absurdity of the growing number of <b>upwardly mobile young people</b> using politics for social capital or it is the secret codex one needs to understand how America operates today.<br><br>For the first camp, AMGS is an inside joke for a handful of cultural writers at the <i>New Yorker, New York Magazine, New York Times</i> and other “tastemaker” publications that has gradually disseminated into the broader milieu. These individuals suggest that AMGC is nothing more than a “funny phrase” that speaks to some particular aspects of current political coalitions.<br><br>For the second camp, largely consisting of several <b>anonymous</b> and <b>extremely prolific Twitter posters</b>, “champagne socialism” is an ideal to strive for and a platform that leftists should adopt. In the words of one poster, <b>mysteriously retweeted by former President John Edwards</b>, “it’s time to redistribute Hamilton tickets to the masses. voters of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your Ticketmaster fees.”</p>`)

              <p>By Mika Aaltola, <i>Intelligent Life</i> | The Economist<br>Op-ed, April 12th, 2007<br><br>Last month, I was alongside a gaggle of other journalists invited to watch the President of the United States give an address at the Senato de Publica (Senate of the Republic) in Rome, Italy. Now usually it is the other way around, with foreign leaders coming to America to address Congress as a display of international camaraderie, but surprisingly, President Clark has decided to stick it the other way.<br><br>With the elegant poise of a general, President Clark would waste no time in addressing the elephant in the room: the specter of Russian influence in Europe. And the agenda was covered concisely with the simple request to the allies of Moscow, stop backing the regime. But this time, the President went a step further. <br><br>“Up north, in the Italian heartland, is a small nation that has, regrettably, chosen to align itself with the authoritarians in the Kremlin. Right in your own backyard.”<br><br>San Marino, a landlocked enclave nestled within the Italian Peninsula, has traditionally maintained a neutral stance in foreign affairs. Recently however, an uptick in Gazprom investments, such as a cheque for one-hundred-thousand US dollars to reportedly “build a new medical school” display that the Captains Regent in the Palazzo has made his stance clear. To some, President Clark’s directness may come off as ‘brash’ or ‘impulsive’. However, such criticisms fail to grasp the game of geopolitical chess being played by the Clark administration. It is clear that his actions are guided by a deep-seated conviction in the righteousness of the Western cause above all else.<br><br>In an article from <i>The Politico</i> that was released just yesterday, a European diplomat, speaking candidly on the condition of anonymity, stated: “What we are seeing is a dangerous game of brinkmanship,” and in that same article, the magazine stated that sources close to Chancellor Merz suggest that he is “pissed off” at the perceived disregard for European interests in the face of American assertiveness.<br><br>But the leadership in both Berlin and Brussels must realize that the alternative to Clark is far grimmer. And to Chancellor Merz, I say this: instead of dwelling on perceived slights and petty squabbles over diplomatic protocol, focus on the broader stratagems at hand. Democracy in the western world cannot afford anything else. <br><br>In President Clark, we finally have a leader who is not content to stand by and watch as the forces of authoritarianism gather strength against us. Instead, he is leading the charge against tyranny with courage and conviction. Thus reminding us all that the fight for freedom is always one worth fighting.</p>`)
