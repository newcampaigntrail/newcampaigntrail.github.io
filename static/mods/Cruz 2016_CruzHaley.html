The e-mail scandal must've really gotten to her, as well as Benghazi.\n\nYou have a lot of support among the Republican establishment, and your convincing victory was able to hold Congress for your party. Therefore, it'll be much easier to pass the legislation you want, whether that'd be tax cuts, repealing Obamacare, or whatever. Just make sure to not alienate too many people or else you'll lose re-election in 2020.",

You end up waking up in your bedroom at your house in River Oaks, and it is really your wife waking you up. It was all a dream. She wakes you up to tell you that Donald Trump won the election, including some Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states.\n\n\"Oh, shit!\" you exclaim. \"This is gonna be a shitshow, alright.\" Hopefully, he won't screw up but it's likely he will.
