But this really is the worst possible outcome. Jack, after all he’s promised, cannot find any ground to negotiate with Byrd and his scum. Nixon will also find himself in a tight spot, with his prominent Black supporters, but Bobby wouldn’t be surprised if Nixon revealed himself as a lilly-white to steal this election. </p> Everything has gone so horribly wrong. Race relations will be set back decades, segregation will be all but enshrined for a minimum of 4 years. People will look back fondly on Esienhower’s bare minimum. Dad hasn’t given up, and intends to call every single favor he can get, but it’s clear Jack has. The best thing that could be said is that hopefully Jack is said up for a comfortable 1964 - he <i>must</i> win, to undo the upcoming terror. .</p>",
