The author of this book, Gao Zimin, was commissioned by presidential candidate James Soong to work with Mr. Lin Shoushan in the Central Election Commission's investigations into the so-called administrative negligence of the lost ballots in Tainan City and the altered results in Jiaxian Township. The author has also carefully investigated and analyzed the various clues of vote counting provided by other voters with a scientific approach, and found that the process of vote counting in progressive democracy Taiwan is still at a very primitive stage, and that vote counting does not require a great deal of effort, and can be done at any time and any place, and that the Election Committee is generous towards these flaws, and that the general public easily considers them as unintentional faults. The general public would easily consider them as unintentional mistakes that are not worth pursuing. These minor mistakes, when taken together, can turn a general election upside down! In that case, even if you want to say that James Soong was eliminated, it may be a reasonable speculation."
