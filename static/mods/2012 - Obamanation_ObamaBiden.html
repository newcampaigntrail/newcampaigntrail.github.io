          <p>Finality.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden somehow still harbored an inkling of delusion that he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016, even in spite of getting sacked. Obama rightfully attested this to senility and was careful not to mock the dottling invalid, if only out of pity. He never trusted Biden, that remained the case and forever would. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, maybe in some ways they still were. Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she'll help craft the direction, decisions, and then in four years time, build upon it. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I think it's fairly obvious, Hillary. You have my support come 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she already knew this. Biden was still smiling, still looking at Obama. It was beginning to disturb the president. Maybe his brain had actually short circuited, and he was currently in internal meltdown. Whatever the case, he didn't want the discharge of any bodily fluids on the Oval Office carpet if Biden was going to go and lose control of all his facilities like this, so it was time to wrap this up.</p><p>“Joe? Did you hear what I just said?”</p><p>Biden blinked slowly. Suddenly, something resembling a glitter of light emerged from the depths of his irises. He was back, for a time, ready to sulk. “Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, discounting his rotting brain, as his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday. Still, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how their second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p><p>Outside the Oval Office, Clinton and Obama continued to walk. Clinton turned, expecting Obama following close behind, only to spot him staring out of a window. Wistfully. She made her way over, placing her hand on his back. Obama only shook his head slightly, his face sunk a little revealing a transparent frown. He sighed before uttering, “all the festivities. I'm, um, not in the mood to partake in all it right now. Hillary.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Obama shrugged. “Feel a little, sad, I suppose. I don't know why.” He looked out the hallway window. “I'm going to get some air.” He got up and made his way to the nearest venue.</p><p>Making his way onto the White House balcony, the pitch dark sky of Washington remained steady. The city banned the use of fireworks. Not so much as a star was out. The light pollution of the city kept them away and presented only a veneer of dark black and blue hues. Clinton came out behind him and stared into it as well, leaning on the balcony railing.</p><p>She waited a few seconds before breaking the silence. “Was it all you wanted, then?”</p><p>Obama pursed his lips and nodded a little. “Just about.” He looked over at Clinton, she was enamored by the night. The solitude of it. It felt right. She was by all definition elderly now, and yet an ambition possessed her, much unlike that of most young men and women in America, trapped in an endless state of arrested development. She kept climbing a ladder and wouldn't stop. Obama had to turn away before Clinton noticed his longing stare, turning back to the night.</p><p>Clinton peered over slightly, and Obama moved his eyes towards her direction. She was indeed growing old now. He had thought her decaying years ago, when he was less wise. Less aware. She was a flower. Clinton was midway through her sixties and she had that sane and practiced eye for the half-concealed disasters that constitute a life. In old age, she only revealed an inner beauty that betrayed her public reputation. She had the beaky and hollow-boned look of a great wading creature. Small prim mouth. A smile that was permanently in conflict with some inner stricture against the seductiveness of humor. He needed her. Her intelligence. Her experience. Her knowledge. Her.</p><p>“I'd only, uh, hope, this presidency did some good. Something worthwhile with the time we had.” Obama bounced his head aimlessly, contemplating how the future historians of the nation would construct his legacy. How they would transcript the manner in which he acted. Would they stick to the truths, or invent fantasies that better characterized an academic for little regard for anything other than preserving his own skin? If it made him look good, he figured that was the best he could hope for. He truly carved his own path. Or, he held the belief he did. Maybe he never had a path of his own to traverse. If not, he took comfort he at least chose the right one. He'd tell himself he did.</p><p>“I'm still sad, Hillary, but, uh, you've given my sadness a richness and depth it has never known before.”</p><p>She turned away, blushing.</p><p>Obama said, “you're more than a fair-weathered friend—you're a true enemy.”</p><p>She turned exceedingly red.</p><p>Obama said, “brilliant people never think of the lives they smash, being brilliant.”</p><p>Obama watched her blush. Clinton adjusted her pearl necklace and pulled down on her jacket. They took a last look at the sky and returned back into the White House.</p>`)

Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, kept asking about him, but Obama didn't know where he could've gone. Maybe he missed the flight.</p><p>Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years.

I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner.</p><p>Obama thought he was hallucinating, but from the corner of his eye, if his vision hadn't been betraying him, he swore he was seeing the trio of mentors who had fostered and brought him to where he was now entering the room: Louis Farrakhan. Bill Ayers. Jeremiah Wright. Like the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future, they stood there, staring down the trio who had been occupying, dictating the policy of the administration these past four years. That and much more was quickly about to change.</p><p>Obama nervously chuckled. He had not anticipated his friends from Chicago's arrival, and quietly but visibly panicked at the sight of them in the same room as his Washington Cabinet. “Minister, I, uh, I-I didn't, um, I, uh, who scheduled this meeting? Did, did someone give you a wrong address, maybe?”</p><p>Farrakhan busted a gut laughing. “Brother Barack, you're a good comedian! Just one of your many talents!” He wagged his finger at the president.</p><p>Biden and Clinton just looked behind them, completely confounded by what was taking place in front of their very eyes. Farrakhan brushed past them, not so much as acknowledging their presence.</p><p>“I've just been having a great night watching the returns come in. We did it! Yes, it was a victory well won!” He was shaking his fist in the air, his tone of voice betraying his words, sounding almost comical in nature. “I mean, what a grand victory it was, yes, Mr. President. A grand, grand affair that truly cements you as a great man!” He flew his arms in the air in exaggeration.</p><p>“Alright, alright. What's going on?” Obama was growing concerned.</p><p>Farrakhan bristled and shook his head. “Only what we've been planning, my friend. It's all,” he spun a nearby globe on its axis, “coming together, now.”</p><p>Biden began tugging on Farrakhan's sleeve. The minister peered over his shoulder to look down at the vice president, attempting to attract his attention feebly, before turning back to Obama. “Mr. President, your Yakubian seems to want my attention.”</p><p>“Hey Jack, I'm right here you can just speak to me...”</p><p>Farrakhan swiftly slapped Biden across the face, leading the old man to collapse from his chair onto the floor. The side of his face red hot, the shape of an open hand was clearly apparent. Biden struggled to rise, as everyone around, mouths agape, witnessed it all unfold.</p><p>“Alright, alright. You...think I'm just...someone you...push around, huh? I'll tell you what, minister, I'll show you some...” Biden clenched his fist, his breathing heavy and labored. Farrakhan smirked slightly, cracking his neck and knuckles, eager to see what he'd do next.</p><p>Biden pounced behind him, preparing to knock the minister flat on the ground, cold. His target was clear. Farrakhan's jaw. The minister laughed out loud and gestured Biden to approach his direction. “Hope the class is paying attention, you're about to see a vice presidential ass-whooping.”</p><p>Biden flew at the speed of a bullet. Throwing the mightiest jab he'd ever conjured, he aimed it directly toward the minister's face as everyone merely continued to spectate the battle, their faces captured in a kaleidoscope of expressive torment and awe. Farrakhan raised his arm trivially and captured Biden's wrist before it could reach its destination, slowly crushing the bones within it as it lay in his grasp. Biden's face grew sullen before it would sink into an anguish of pain and misery in the succeeding seconds after, followed by the collapse of his posture into a kneeling position. He could only scream as Farrakhan continued to crush his wrist like brittle styrofoam accompanied by tears of blood fleeing from his corneas.</p><p>It took a disturbingly long period of time before an intervention could rescue the pitiful vice president, as Obama stepped forward and yelled, “enough!”</p><p>Farrakhan, insulted by the interruption, let go of Biden to stare coldy at his protégé. Biden crawled to the Resolute Desk, mounting himself over it to regain his stature and any lingering element of self-respect left buried deep within his person. “I'll, just sit here, then.”</p><p>Farrakhan pointed at Biden. “You'll do no such thing. Now get out of here! You and that murderous bitch!” Clinton's eyes widened. She arose and walked to the minister. The two were locked in a staredown, the room dead silent. “This murderous bitch will leave on her own accord,” she scoffed. She looked over at Obama. “I was right about you.”</p><p>Clinton made her exit from the room. Biden fell over, unconscious.</p><p>“I never took you for a, uh, hotep, minister.” Farrakhan chuckled slightly. “You're in my good graces, but if you ever suggest to me that any action I'm taking is too far, that you have the command and wield the power to dictate my actions. You'll be where your vice president is,” he knelt down and, with his hand around Biden's cheeks, violently shook his head before letting go and allowing it to slam on the floor, “only not looking so pretty.”</p><p> Obama breathed, falling deeper into his chair as he awaited Farrakhan's next move. He moved over towards Obama, grabbing him forcefully by the collar, and flung him from his seat. “Brother Barack. I have great admiration for you. You're a great student, but a student is what you remain.” He sat in the chair, kicking his feet up on the Resolute Desk, busting out a cigar. “Bill, throw a light.” Ayers did as Farrakhan commanded, throwing him a lighter for his cigar.</p><p>Obama dusted himself off, bearing a face of astonishment. He couldn't believe how he was being treated. He did everything they asked, and this was how he was thanked?</p><p>“Y-y-you can't just treat me this way, I'm, um, the president. Minister. I ask for so much as a little respect. Not you to go around, smashing things, beating my subordinates. You can't-”</p><p>Farrakhan dropped his feet from the desk, silencing Obama. He stood up from the chair and walked over in his direction. “Brother Barack, you're right. I have been a rude guest in your place of residency, for that I apologize. I ask only for you to treat me with the same respect I'll provide to you.” He flung his arm over Obama's neck, clutching him in his grasp. Obama struggled a bit and wriggled out, shooting a look of confusion and anger.</p><p>Farrakhan recognized this, nodding. “Alright. I see how you want it. I'll show you what we'll do if you keep your act up.” He snapped his fingers. “Let him in.”</p><p>The entrance way of the Oval Office cracked open. A shadowy figure dragged some hobbling man and threw him into the room. Obama couldn't finger who it was, it looked to be just some random staffer, a field hand for the campaign back in Chicago.</p><p>The man got up and limped a little, collapsing head first. His teeth were rattling, head busted wide open. The blood had poured right into the dark blue of the carpet, creating a sickly purplish hue. Obama ran over and knelt before this unknown soldier. “Friend,” he lifted him a little and tried to keep him conscious. “Friend, for the love of god, who did this to you?”</p><p>The man coughed up a tooth, spitting the gunk from his mouth out in an attempt to converse. Obama patted his back softly, leaning him against the wall.</p><p>“Speak slow. Friend, whatever your name is, are you okay?”</p><p>The man opened his eyes, they were reddish around the sides. He looked dazed, barely aware of his surroundings. They dotted aimlessly before landing on the president. “Where...” Obama's eyes lit up. “Yes? Speak slowly. Stay with me, man. Speak slow. Tell me what happened.” The man coughed. “Men... in...there were men...”</p><p>“Speak, slow. Speak to me.”</p><p>“They, they took me in, around election night...back in Chicago...they...took others. I don't remember much. My head hurts, Mr. President.” The man's eyes began to close, Obama held him tight. He turned over to Minister Farrakhan, Professor Ayers and Reverend Wright. “Did you do this?”</p><p>Farrakhan slowly marched over, possessing a small bounce to his demeanor. “Brother Barack. I'm aware the presence of a battered footsoldier here must be a troubling sight to see, I am not a heartless creature like the white man, no offense intended Ayers, but I may empathize with your station.” He approached Obama and the staffer, bleeding out on the Oval Office floor. “A liability, I hate to say to you, Mr. President. But a liability. Men like this are liabilities, party servants. I don't serve a party. I don't serve an elephant or donkey who tells me what to do, what to say. I am my own man, and it's about time you became one too.” He turned around and glanced around the room.</p><p>“Same for your vice president, the madam secretary, the Gates boy, Axelrod, who we've talked some sense into, I'm happy to say.” Obama shot a face of distress at him, seeking further elaboration on what exactly he meant by that. Farrakhan just cracked a smile and laughed.</p><p>He stood over Obama, who held this nameless chump in his arms, whose body was growing cold. Farrakhan placed his hand on his shoulder and whispered into his ear. “They're all expendable, steps on a stairway.” He let go and readjusted himself. “If that's all, we must get going. This country won't be rebirthed from just one measly administrative action. We'll see what we can do, is that right, men?” Ayers and Wright nodded along. “A grand future for you we've got planned, my student. Your destiny, legacy, is only just now being written. With us by your side, once we finish with the re-education of your subordinates, as you call them, and this pathetic political party of yours, we're going to make dreams come true.”</p><p>Farrakhan snapped his fingers and led his lieutenants out. Before he exited from the room completely, he turned one last time to Obama and stared at him before letting out a sigh. “You've already made your choice.” He flicked the lightswitch and left.</p><p>Obama was gone.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Let Them Teach You</h3>
            <p><p>Anticlimactic.</p><p>It was anticlimactic in Chicago. Or was it?</p><p>Obama was cycling between his phone, analyzing the map and electoral vote count presented on <i>The New York Times</i> webpage, and CNN's live coverage on the television. He had his phone on silent, wishing to remain undisturbed in his hour of intense deliberation over the results.</p><p>If he could keep up his margins in...no...but if he is able to hold down...hey, that's good...but...that's not good.</p><p>Axelrod entered the corner of his vision, looking just a little haggard.</p><p>“What's it looking like, David?”</p><p>Axelrod cocked his eyebrows up. “It looks like a deadlock.”</p><p>He peered over at the screen. Anderson Cooper was reflecting on a swing in favor of the Republicans. They had several congressional races edge out their way. Indiana was being closely watched. Montana, too.</p><p>Obama put his phone down, rethinking it for a second, before ultimately shoving it into a draw of his desk to keep it out of reach. “Not our night.”</p><p>Axelrod was holding a binder of notes and other paperwork, presumably cataloguing relevant information for a future memoir or other piece of writing he will be turning his attention to once tonight wraps up. “With the House as it is, I think Huntsman has our balls in a vise.”</p><p>Rubbing his chin, thumb tucked just underneath, Obama looked down and contemplated for a moment. What went wrong? It really did look like things had been turning around after Lehman. Or maybe that was in his head. He might've just become too detached from it all, let the presidency cloud him and dull what were his keen senses. His ability to put his finger on the pulse of the people. Alternatively, he was just lucky. That was the more likely explanation, considering he managed to blow what was such an easy race. The right man, the right moment, or almost the right moment. Just a little off. A few months difference, that's all it could've took.</p><p>“Yeah, you're, uh, right, David.” He dusted himself off and gave it a rest, feeling it best to stop dwelling over the finer details.</p><p>Axelrod sensed it right to inject an air of levity to the situation and supplement his boss with a warm exchange, but decided against it at the last second, so he just stood there for a few additional seconds waiting for Obama to say something. When he didn't, Axelrod tried to jump to a conversation starter to change the subject, but found it hard thinking of something that could take the mind off of an election that would lead to the eviction of him and his family. Then he remembered.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, Barry,” he took out a cheap throwaway phone from out his suit jacket, “some, guy, he gave me this earlier today. He looked kinda odd...”</p><p>Axelrod tried to remember what it was about the man, he felt like there was something transparently strange about him, but the misplaced hope of victory from earlier that evening gave way to an absent-minded sense of displacement that he didn't pay it much mind. So he had forgot up until now.</p><p>“I don't even know how he got the credentials to be here, to be honest.”</p><p> Obama reached out and took it from his subordinate's grasp. “Thanks, David. I'll take it from here.” He signaled for Axelrod to leave the room, and after glancing one last time at the television, he would.</p><p>Closing the door, Obama sat back down and dialed the only number available, before putting it to his ear.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“Why the dour mood?”</p><p>Obama perked an eyebrow. “I, uh...I. I, um, uh, don't know if you're familiar, but a deadlock means...”</p><p>The voice on the other end began hushing Obama to be quiet. Obama watched the television screen. Clueless crowds were assembled, they just stood around, staring at the results with blank expressions. They were unsure of what to make of it, they didn't know if their team had won, but neither did he. “Unless...”</p><p>“I think you're catching along quickly. As one, old colonizing white man once said, 'never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.'” </p><p>“But surely...if I, uh, understand you correctly. What you're proposing, it's going to be a gamble.”</p><p>“No gamble, Barry. A wrench in our cogs of progress? Yes, but better that than ultimate defeat. There's a comeback in the making here, we need you to get the ball rolling on it. Incite the infighting on their flank, set them upon one another and let them tear themselves apart. It'll work perfectly.”</p><p>Obama had the future envisioned, the suggestion of it. It was sly and tricky, no doubt a measure that could've only come from some big failures, but the opportunity to remake all of it and improve. Perhaps start over. Second chances. This is a second chance.</p><p>“I'll keep in contact. I'll let you know how it goes, I expect some measures form your end, too. It'll need to be a joint effort. We'll stay in touch, goodbye.”</p><p>Obama hung up, opened a window behind him, and casually dropped the phone out of it before turning back around to see Michelle.</p><p>“Oh, uh, Michelle. Sorry.”</p><p>Michelle shook her head slightly. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen. After they recognize the error of their ways, they'll come crawling back.</p>`)

          <p>Oblivion.</p><p>Obama was taking calls from several people, none of which were from his opponent, as he had anticipated. Instead, they were donors, governors, Senators, party bosses, his running mate, all in his ear screaming in a bloody panic about the crisis. Democrats were being electorally and systemically slaughtered. Analysts and experts had thought the midterm gains for the Republicans would stop at 2010, but they were wrong. It was open season.</p><p>Obama flung his Samsung across the room, as Axelrod ducked before it could careen at his forehead. “Mr. President!”</p><p>“Sorry, David. Hadn't seen you there.”</p><p>Axelrod picked up the cracked phone. “Christ's sakes, you nearly took my head off.” He tossed in it a nearby bin. “I can't say I blame you though. They're calling it the worst defeat for an incumbent president since, well, Taft, around 100 years to this day.”</p><p>“Thanks, Axe. I really needed to hear that right now.”</p><p>“It's all my fault, Barry. I was responsible for helping you, and I let you burn into flames. I'm sorry.”</p><p>“We got, uh, cocky, David. We were so full of ourselves we thought we could course-correct after what was practically, the, uh, you know, 21st century Great Depression. We were doomed from the jump.”</p><p>“You're not wrong, ever since Lehman it has just been shit. But Christ. Barry. They're projecting you lost every mainland state. It's just...it's like the end of the world...”</p><p>Obama leaned back in his chair and huffed. “Well, let's hope the Mayans weren't far off, then. But I'd rather not think about this right now, David. About, uh, legacy. I don't have that luxury anymore. I've brought everyone down with me with this loss. At least for you, maybe most Americans don't know who you are. I don't know how I will avoid the infamy. If only McGovern didn't die last month, I could ask for tips.”</p><p>Axelrod combed his sausage fingers through his receding hair. “Well, I came in, because for some reason, I don't know, I got a line on this Obama phone here.” He picked it out of his suit jacket, dangling it in the air. “Some...guy. He dropped it on my desk at the beginning of the day. Wouldn't say his name either. They were even using some voice modifier, I think. Jesus, Barry, what is this? Are you...you're not actually some kind of...I don't know... too be frank, I probably don't want to.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Obama reached out an open hand. “Just give it here, David. Some things you were kept out of the loop for, for your, uh, own peace of mind.”</p><p>Rubbing his temples with one hand, Axelrod dropped the cheap, throwaway phone in his boss's, before leaving the room, defeatedly. Pulling the phone to his ear, Obama nonchalantly answered.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“What a fall from grace this turned out to be.”</p><p>“Oh, I have, uh, only you folks to thank for that, now don't I? Teaming with that crank in Vermont so you could give a Bush lackey the, um, ultimate victory. Where was the sense in that? Please educate me.”</p><p>“Your failings were all brought on by yourself and yourself alone, don't delude yourself otherwise. We were merely spectators in your self-inflicted demise brought on by a thousand cuts from your own hand. But anyway, I don't think you need me to tell you this mission's been a failure. Your association with us is terminated, effective immediately. We do offer thanks. Thanks that you wiped your hands of us before you could flameout and bring us down with you.”</p><p>“That's a shame, you, you know. You've been such great help, always, um, pitching in. Doing nothing. Just sitting there, complaining, like children, when you were upset, or what have you. I mean with friends like these why need enem...”</p><p>“Just a question, Barry. Why the turn? Did their allure of money break you? Were you always a double agent? Have you ever really believed in <i>anything</i>?”</p><p>Obama stopped what he had been thinking and allowed himself to ponder on their inquiries. The answer seemed relatively obvious, only, under the circumstances, he couldn't exactly say it without looking like an ass.</p><p>“Did we disconnect...”</p><p>“Your, uh, system, set of beliefs. They're incompatible with how things work. If I had gone in lockstep with you, never become my own man, well I'd be a, um, uh, doing far worse than how I am now. I can promise you that. You would've destroyed me.” In the background, Anderson Cooper was reporting on staffers being talked off the ledge at the Obama watch party.</p><p>“I don't even know what to say...except...well, I want you to hear this, Barry. Put the phone as close to your ear as possible.”</p><p>Obama was intrigued if not a bit dreadful, but he did as he was told.</p><p>“It there? Okay, good. Now, hear this.”</p><p>The phone caught fire.</p><p>Obama backed away from it immediately, crashing into some curtains and cabinets. The fire alarm picked up the flaming object and began wailing. He could hear the screams and surprise from outside the room as the faucets shot water down. The combusted phone began to get drenched, and eventually, nothing was left of it but chared bits and pieces of electronics.</p><p>Michelle rushed in under the doorway. “Barry, Barry!

          <p>Somber.</p><p>It was somber in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was cycling between his phone, analyzing the map and electoral vote count presented on <i>The New York Times</i> webpage, and CNN's live coverage on the television. He had his phone on silent, wishing to remain undisturbed in his hour of intense deliberation over the results.</p><p>If he could keep up his margins in...no...but if he is able to hold down...damn...alright, but...that's not good.</p><p>Axelrod entered the corner of his vision, looking just a little haggard.</p><p>“What's it looking like, David?”</p><p>Axelrod cocked his eyebrows up. “Not good, Barry.”</p><p>Obama lightly shook his head and let out a mild puff. “Could've told you that.”</p><p>“Right, but that's what I've got.”</p><p>He peered over at the screen. Anderson Cooper was reflecting on a swing in favor of the Republicans. They had several congressional races edge out their way. Indiana was being closely watched. Montana, too. North Dakota was gone, sorry Heidi.</p><p>Obama put his phone down, rethinking it for a second, before ultimately shoving it into a draw of his desk to keep it out of reach. “Not our night.”</p><p>Axelrod was holding a binder of notes and other paperwork, presumably cataloguing relevant information for a future memoir or other piece of writing he will be turning his attention to once tonight wraps up. “Think it best to call it.”</p><p>Rubbing his chin, thumb tucked just underneath, Obama looked down and contemplated for a moment. What went wrong? It really did look like things had been turning around after Lehman. Or maybe that was in his head. He might've just become too detached from it all, let the presidency cloud him and dull what were his keen senses. His ability to put his finger on the pulse of the people. Alternatively, he was just lucky. The right man, the right moment, or almost the right moment. Just a little off. A few months difference, that's all it could've took.</p><p>“Yeah, you're, uh, right, David.” He dusted himself off and gave it a rest, feeling it best to stop dwelling over the finer details.</p><p>Axelrod sensed it right to inject an air of levity to the situation and supplement his boss with a warm exchange, but decided against it at the last second, so he just stood there for a few additional seconds waiting for Obama to say something. When he didn't, Axelrod tried to jump to a conversation starter to change the subject, but found it hard thinking of something that could take the mind off of an election that would lead to the eviction of him and his family. Then he remembered.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, Barry,” he took out a cheap throwaway phone from out his suit jacket, “some, guy, he gave me this earlier today. He looked kinda odd...”</p><p>Axelrod tried to remember what it was about the man, he felt like there was something transparently strange about him, but the misplaced hope of victory from earlier that evening gave way to an absent-minded sense of displacement that he didn't pay it much mind. So he had forgot up until now.</p><p>“I don't even know how he got the credentials to be here, to be honest.”</p><p> Obama reached out and took it from his subordinate's grasp. “Thanks, David. I'll take it from here.” He signaled for Axelrod to leave the room, which he gladly accepted.</p><p>Closing the door, Obama sat back down and dialed the only number available, before putting it to his ear.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“Well, you sure handled things well enough without us.”</p><p>“Well, I've, uh...” Obama peered at the television screen again, he must've missed when they declared Gingrich the winner. He was a bit thankful for being spared that humiliation.</p><p>“Yeah, looks like it.”</p><p>“We had hoped for your downfall, but we didn't quite expect it, so this is a welcome surprise.”</p><p>“Don't say I never delivered for you.” This looked to be devolving into a victory lap.</p><p>“Guess so. This stinging loss has failed to deteriorate your vast ego, we see. If you had so much as an inkling of care for the people you supposedly served it may have proved more devastating, but that's asking far too much of you. There is no father of yours to cry to, nobody you answer to. Only yourself. Liberating, I'm sure. Now you can wither and die in that isolation you've crafted for yourself. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“You could've been so much more. Could've changed this nation for the better, rebuilt it, with us by your side. We could've created wonders, erased the sin from...”</p><p>Obama hung up, opened a window behind him, and casually dropped the phone out of it before turning back around to see Michelle.</p><p>“Oh, uh, Michelle. Sorry.”</p><p>Michelle shook her head slightly. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen. It was time to give Gingrich a call.</p>`)

He looked kinda odd...”</p><p>Axelrod tried to remember what it was about the man, he felt like there was something transparently strange about him, but the misplaced hope of victory from earlier that evening gave way to an absent-minded sense of displacement that he didn't pay it much mind. So he had forgot up until now.</p><p>“I don't even know how he got the credentials to be here, to be honest.”</p><p> Obama reached out and took it from his subordinate's grasp. “Thanks, David.

Joe Arpaio? Good Christ, how did he let it come to this?</p><p>It'd be a miracle if the pundits and historians of the future gave him the credit he, at least, wasn't his successor. But to have lost, allowed them to gain power. That was a blot he'd forever have to bare with. He brought himself out of his head and returned his attention back to the call.</p><p>“You know I can, uh, call later if you're busy.”</p><p>“We have to apologize. We truly thought you were, at one point, a man of talent. Capable of legendary feats. But we were wrong. You were a victim of our hopes, and we crafted this myth around you. It isn't your fault you're a failure, a joke. It's ours for not seeing that in the first place and letting you emasculate yourself in front of millions. Even if you were a traitor to the cause, losing to him, it just makes us all look bad. For that, we owe you our amends.”</p><p>“You about finished?”</p><p>“Guess so. This stinging loss has failed to deteriorate your vast ego, we see. If you had so much as an inkling of care for the people you supposedly served it may have proved more devastating, but that's asking far too much of you. There is no father of yours to cry to, nobody you answer to. Only yourself. Liberating, I'm sure. Now you can wither and die in that isolation you've crafted for yourself. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“You could've been so much more. Could've changed this nation for the better, rebuilt it, with us by your side. We could've created wonders, erased the sin from...”</p><p>Obama hung up, opened a window behind him, and casually dropped the phone out of it before turning back around to see Michelle.</p><p>“Oh, uh, Michelle. Sorry.”</p><p>Michelle shook her head slightly. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen.

We truly thought you were, at one point, a man of talent. Capable of legendary feats. But we were wrong. You were a victim of our hopes, and we crafted this myth around you. It isn't your fault you're a failure, a joke. It's ours for not seeing that in the first place and letting you emasculate yourself in front of millions. Even if you were a traitor to the cause, losing to him, it just makes us all look bad. For that, we owe you our amends.”</p><p>“You about finished?”</p><p>“Guess so. This stinging loss has failed to deteriorate your vast ego, we see. If you had so much as an inkling of care for the people you supposedly served it may have proved more devastating, but that's asking far too much of you. There is no father of yours to cry to, nobody you answer to. Only yourself. Liberating, I'm sure. Now you can wither and die in that isolation you've crafted for yourself. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“You could've been so much more. Could've changed this nation for the better, rebuilt it, with us by your side. We could've created wonders, erased the sin from...”</p><p>Obama hung up, opened a window behind him, and casually dropped the phone out of it before turning back around to see Michelle.</p><p>“Oh, uh, Michelle. Sorry.”</p><p>Michelle shook her head slightly. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen. It was time to give Paul a call.</p>`)

          <p>Somber.</p><p>It was somber in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was cycling between his phone, analyzing the map and electoral vote count presented on <i>The New York Times</i> webpage, and CNN's live coverage on the television. He had his phone on silent, wishing to remain undisturbed in his hour of intense deliberation over the results.</p><p>If he could keep up his margins in...no...but if he is able to hold down...damn...alright, but...that's not good.</p><p>Axelrod entered the corner of his vision, looking just a little haggard.</p><p>“What's it looking like, David?”</p><p>Axelrod cocked his eyebrows up. “Not good, Barry.”</p><p>Obama lightly shook his head and let out a mild puff. “Could've told you that.”</p><p>“Right, but that's what I've got.”</p><p>He peered over at the screen. Anderson Cooper was reflecting on a swing in favor of the Republicans. They had several congressional races edge out their way. Indiana was being closely watched. Montana, too. North Dakota was gone, sorry Heidi.</p><p>Obama put his phone down, rethinking it for a second, before ultimately shoving it into a draw of his desk to keep it out of reach. “Not our night.”</p><p>Axelrod was holding a binder of notes and other paperwork, presumably cataloguing relevant information for a future memoir or other piece of writing he will be turning his attention to once tonight wraps up. “Think it best to call it.”</p><p>Rubbing his chin, thumb tucked just underneath, Obama looked down and contemplated for a moment. What went wrong? It really did look like things had been turning around after Lehman. Or maybe that was in his head. He might've just become too detached from it all, let the presidency cloud him and dull what were his keen senses. His ability to put his finger on the pulse of the people.

When he didn't, Axelrod tried to jump to a conversation starter to change the subject, but found it hard thinking of something that could take the mind off of an election that would lead to the eviction of him and his family. Then he remembered.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, Barry,” he took out a cheap throwaway phone from out his suit jacket, “some, guy, he gave me this earlier today. He looked kinda odd...”</p><p>Axelrod tried to remember what it was about the man, he felt like there was something transparently strange about him, but the misplaced hope of victory from earlier that evening gave way to an absent-minded sense of displacement that he didn't pay it much mind. So he had forgot up until now.</p><p>“I don't even know how he got the credentials to be here, to be honest.”</p><p> Obama reached out and took it from his subordinate's grasp. “Thanks, David.

          <p>Pandemonium.</p><p>It was pandemonium in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was taking calls from several people, none of which were from his opponent, as he had anticipated. Instead, they were donors, governors, Senators, party bosses, his running mate, all in his ear screaming in a bloody panic about the crisis. Democrats were being electorally and systemically slaughtered. Analysts and experts had thought the midterm gains for the Republicans would stop at 2010, but they were wrong. It was open season.</p><p>Obama flung his Samsung across the room, as Axelrod ducked before it could careen at his forehead. “Mr. President!”</p><p>“Sorry, David. Hadn't seen you there.”</p><p>Axelrod picked up the cracked phone. “Christ's sakes, you nearly took my head off.” He tossed in it a nearby bin. “You're not the first president to lose badly, you won't be the last.”</p><p>“No. I've just, uh, just got the taint of humiliating loss, to, you know, Dick fucking Cheney. I'll be lucky if I'm just relegated to that little, uh, you know, that nice factoid in the future, first Black president, when I expect folks are going to rather forget I existed. I can't imagine a post-racial America would look too good having dumped their first Black man like this.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Won't look too good in the history textbooks. Not much of a feel good story.”</p><p>“Right, well I've got people on my lines, too. I don't know how in the name of God this could happen. I really don't. Jesus Christ, ever since Lehman it has just been shit.”</p><p>Obama leaned back in his chair and huffed. “I'd rather not think about that right now, David. About, uh, legacy. I don't have that luxury anymore. In your case I can only hope you've got some, um, Plan B after all this. At least for you, maybe most Americans don't know who you are. I don't know how I will avoid the infamy.”</p><p>Axelrod combed his sausage fingers through his receding hair. “Well, I came in, because for some reason, I don't know, I got a line on this Obama phone here.” He picked it out of his suit jacket, dangling it in the air. “Some...guy. He dropped it on my desk at the beginning of the day. Wouldn't say his name either. They were even using some voice modifier, I think. Jesus, Barry, what is this? Are you...you're not actually some kind of...I don't know... too be frank, I probably don't want to.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Obama reached out an open hand. “Just give it here, David. Some things you were kept out of the loop for, for your, uh, own peace of mind.”</p><p>Rubbing his temples with one hand, Axelrod dropped the cheap, throwaway phone in his boss's, before leaving the room, defeatedly. Pulling the phone to his ear, Obama nonchalantly answered.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“I'm sure you saw the returns.”</p><p>“No, it slipped my mind. How's it looking?”</p><p>“I don't think you need me to tell you this mission's been a failure. Your association with us is terminated, effective immediately. We do offer thanks. Thanks that you wiped your hands of us before you could flameout and bring us down with you.”</p><p>“That's a shame, you, you know. You've been such great help, always, um, pitching in. Doing nothing. Just sitting there, complaining, like children, when you were upset, or what have you. I mean with friends like these why need enem...”</p><p>“Just a question, Barry. Why the turn? Did their allure of money break you? Were you always a double agent? Have you ever really believed in <i>anything</i>?”</p><p>Obama stopped what he had been thinking and allowed himself to ponder on their inquiries. The answer seemed relatively obvious, only, under the circumstances, he couldn't exactly say it without looking like an ass.</p><p>“Did we disconnect...”</p><p>“Your, uh, system, set of beliefs. They're incompatible with how things work. If I had gone in lockstep with you, never become my own man, well I'd be a, um, uh, doing far worse than how I am now. I can promise you that. You would've destroyed me.” In the background, Anderson Cooper was reporting on staffers being talked off the ledge at the Obama watch party.</p><p>“I don't even know what to say...except...well, I want you to hear this, Barry. Put the phone as close to your ear as possible.”</p><p>Obama was intrigued if not a bit dreadful, but he did as he was told.</p><p>“It there? Okay, good. Now, hear this.”</p><p>The phone caught fire.</p><p>Obama backed away from it immediately, crashing into some curtains and cabinets. The fire alarm picked up the flaming object and began wailing. He could hear the screams and surprise from outside the room as the faucets shot water down. The combusted phone began to get drenched, and eventually, nothing was left of it but chared bits and pieces of electronics.</p><p>Michelle rushed in under the doorway. “Barry, Barry! Are you okay?”</p><p>Obama was now soaked. His crisp, well-tailored suit. Wet. The cusps of his right sleeve. Slightly burnt.</p><p>He stood there, under the pouring rain from up above.</p><p>“I'm fine, Michelle.”</p><p>Michelle walked up and lightly fixed him up, pointlessly. “Well, from my eyes, you're standing here. Under an active fire alarm, with water in your shoe and,” she glanced at the floor, “a broken, burnt phone?”</p><p>Obama picked up Michelle's wrists and pulled her in close, kissing her forehead as he did so. “It's not important anymore, Michelle. This, uh, this, a, endeavor, didn't work out like I thought it would. It's not the end. Me, you, Sasha, Malia, bring Bo and Sunny along, we're getting out of here.”</p><p>“Where we going?”</p><p>“Anywhere. Anywhere, but, uh, here. Let's go.”</p><p>Skipping his concession speech, Obama took Michelle by the hand, and fled the scene as interns and administration staff wildly raced around, jostling papers, and entered into the dead of night, into the great unknown.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Strange Character to this Black Achievement</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents.

e.pages.push(`<h3>Strange Character to this Black Achievement</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024?

Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured.

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe.

e.pages.push(`<h3>Strange Character to this Black Achievement</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness.

e.pages.push(`<h3>Strange Character to this Black Achievement</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents.

          <p>Adequate.</p><p>It was adequate in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely.

The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Adequate.</p><p>It was adequate in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress.

          <p>Adequate.</p><p>It was adequate in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City.

Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this?

He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, he was glad he got the opportunity to kick him to the curb. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult, especially with her having just won on the same ticket as Obama. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in the contempt he held for his soon-to-be former boss and his successor. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation confirmation. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Why'd the hell you invite me to this, Jack? So you could get your rocks off to me feeling anymore like shit?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew some people just didn't make the cut sometimes, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Heartbreak.</p><p>It was heartbreak in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was taking calls from several people, none of which were from his opponent, as he had anticipated. Instead, they were donors, governors, Senators, party bosses, his running mate, all in his ear screaming in a bloody panic about the crisis. Democrats were being electorally and systemically slaughtered. Analysts and experts had thought the midterm gains for the Republicans would stop at 2010, but they were wrong. It was open season.</p><p>Obama flung his Samsung across the room, as Axelrod ducked before it could careen at his forehead. “Mr. President!”</p><p>“Sorry, David. Hadn't seen you there.”</p><p>Axelrod picked up the cracked phone. “Christ's sakes, you nearly took my head off.” He tossed in it a nearby bin. “You're not the first president to lose badly, you won't be the last.”</p><p>“No. I've just, uh, just got the taint of humiliating landslide loss is all. I'll be lucky if I'm just relegated to that little, uh, you know, that nice factoid in the future, first Black president, when I expect folks are going to rather forget I existed. I can't imagine a post-racial America would look too good having dumped their first Black man like this.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Won't look too good in the history textbooks. Not much of a feel good story.”</p><p>“Right, well I've got people on my lines, too. I don't know how in the name of God this could happen. I really don't. Jesus Christ, ever since Lehman it has just been shit.”</p><p>Obama leaned back in his chair and huffed. “I'd rather not think about that right now, David. About, uh, legacy. I don't have that luxury anymore. In your case I can only hope you've got some, um, Plan B after all this. At least for you, maybe most Americans don't know who you are. I don't know how I will avoid the infamy.”</p><p>Axelrod combed his sausage fingers through his receding hair. “Well, I came in, because for some reason, I don't know, I got a line on this Obama phone here.” He picked it out of his suit jacket, dangling it in the air. “Some...guy. He dropped it on my desk at the beginning of the day. Wouldn't say his name either. They were even using some voice modifier, I think. Jesus, Barry, what is this? Are you...you're not actually some kind of...I don't know... too be frank, I probably don't want to.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Obama reached out an open hand. “Just give it here, David. Some things you were kept out of the loop for, for your, uh, own peace of mind.”</p><p>Rubbing his temples with one hand, Axelrod dropped the cheap, throwaway phone in his boss's, before leaving the room, defeatedly. Pulling the phone to his ear, Obama nonchalantly answered.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“I'm sure you saw the returns.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It isn't your fault. It's ours. We should've known better than tasking you with such a mission. It was beyond your pay grade.”</p><p>“Oh, s-stop with the, uh, lecture. That's not true. I couldn't have turned that Lehman collapse around, a black swan event?”</p><p>“You're just lying to yourself now, Barry. Great men are not made, they're born, and they don't let tiny things like an economic downturn ruin them. That was the perfect opportunity, the perfect opportunity to remake everything from the ground up without you needing to lift a finger. But to do that it takes an exceptional man, an exceptional man of quality you couldn't meet. You were far from that. Pitiful. We're not saying this as some humiliation ritual, if anything it's to ward you off from further hurting you and your family, their name is already cursed now, don't make it worse on them. Great men do not lose, in such a scale, to people of such, I don't even know the word for it, the opponents you had, it shouldn't have been close nevermind you losing like this. This all should humble you, Barry. About time you were. You do not have <i>it</i>. It's made all the worse that you didn't go back on your word to us, you've done damage we're not fixing anytime soon.”</p><p>Obama could've sworn a tear had emerged from the depths of his eyes. He felt a slow drip. He had taught himself never to cry. Public events that demanded such, as any trained politician would be able, were the only appopriate settings for him to do so. The idea he'd get emotional over this was patently ridiculous. He checked his eyes, but they were dry. Looking up, he noticed a leak from the ceiling above. He took a breath, comforted by the knowledge that even in the face of ultimate defeat he remained emotionally sterile, but still, something within him had been pierced through the heart. Even contemplating this for as long as he was, it wasn't like him at all. This was all so beneath him.</p><p>But <i>was</i> is the keyword.</p><p>He allowed himself to be made a fool, <i>to believe in something</i>. Oh, brother. Everyone can see him as little more than an idealistic idiot now, him foremost. It did not take him having an infantile spasm or panic attack to demonstrate the full width of that. He knew it deep down, what felt like a bottomless pit, buried deep down where the self-doubt and insecurities of disconnect had been thrown. It was clear to everyone now. He was naked, a myth no longer.</p><p>“Are you still there, Barry?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Now he was just a man.</p><p>“Alright. Now. Dispose of the phone because it automatically self-destructs, we don't want you hurt, we aren't cruel, not to those who don't deserve it, anyway. Forget our names, we've already forgotten yours.”</p><p>Did Obama hear that right? The phone would catch what now?</p><p>Catch on fire. The phone caught on fire.</p><p>Obama stood up immediately and tried to back away, crashing into some curtains and cabinets. The fire alarm picked up the flaming object and began wailing. He could hear the screams and surprise from outside the room as the faucets shot water down. The combusted phone began to get drenched, and eventually, nothing was left of it but chared bits and pieces of electronics.</p><p>Michelle rushed in under the doorway. “Barry, Barry! Are you okay?”</p><p>Obama was now soaked. His crisp, well-tailored suit. Wet. The cusps of his right sleeve. Slightly burnt.</p><p>He stood there, under the pouring rain from up above.</p><p>“I'm fine, Michelle.”</p><p>Michelle walked up and lightly fixed him up, pointlessly. “Well, from my eyes, you're standing here. Under an active fire alarm, with water in your shoe and,” she glanced at the floor, “a broken, burnt phone?”</p><p>Obama picked up Michelle's wrists and pulled her in close, kissing her forehead as he did so. “It's not important anymore, Michelle. This, uh, this, a, endeavor, didn't work out like I thought it would. It's not the end. Me, you, Sasha, Malia, bring Bo and Sunny along, we're getting out of here.”</p><p>“Where we going?”</p><p>“Anywhere. Anywhere, but, uh, here. Let's go.”</p><p>Skipping his concession speech, Obama took Michelle by the hand, and fled the scene as interns and administration staff wildly raced around, jostling papers, and entered into the dead of night, into the great unknown.</p>`)

          <p>Heartbreak.</p><p>It was heartbreak in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was taking calls from several people, none of which were from his opponent, as he had anticipated. Instead, they were donors, governors, Senators, party bosses, his running mate, all in his ear screaming in a bloody panic about the crisis. Democrats were being electorally and systemically slaughtered. Analysts and experts had thought the midterm gains for the Republicans would stop at 2010, but they were wrong.

I'll be lucky if I'm just relegated to that little, uh, you know, that nice factoid in the future, first Black president, when I expect folks are going to rather forget I existed. I can't imagine a post-racial America would look too good having dumped their first Black man like this.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Won't look too good in the history textbooks. Not much of a feel good story.”</p><p>“Right, well I've got people on my lines, too. I don't know how in the name of God this could happen. I really don't. Jesus Christ, ever since Lehman it has just been shit.”</p><p>Obama leaned back in his chair and huffed. “I'd rather not think about that right now, David. About, uh, legacy. I don't have that luxury anymore. In your case I can only hope you've got some, um, Plan B after all this. At least for you, maybe most Americans don't know who you are. I don't know how I will avoid the infamy.”</p><p>Axelrod combed his sausage fingers through his receding hair. “Well, I came in, because for some reason, I don't know, I got a line on this Obama phone here.” He picked it out of his suit jacket, dangling it in the air. “Some...guy. He dropped it on my desk at the beginning of the day. Wouldn't say his name either. They were even using some voice modifier, I think. Jesus, Barry, what is this? Are you...you're not actually some kind of...I don't know... too be frank, I probably don't want to.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Obama reached out an open hand. “Just give it here, David.

          <p>Heartbreak.</p><p>It was heartbreak in Chicago.</p><p>Obama was taking calls from several people, none of which were from his opponent, as he had anticipated. Instead, they were donors, governors, Senators, party bosses, his running mate, all in his ear screaming in a bloody panic about the crisis. Democrats were being electorally and systemically slaughtered. Analysts and experts had thought the midterm gains for the Republicans would stop at 2010, but they were wrong. It was open season.</p><p>Obama flung his Samsung across the room, as Axelrod ducked before it could careen at his forehead. “Mr. President!”</p><p>“Sorry, David. Hadn't seen you there.”</p><p>Axelrod picked up the cracked phone. “Christ's sakes, you nearly took my head off.” He tossed in it a nearby bin. “You're not the first president to lose badly, you won't be the last.”</p><p>“No. I've just, uh, just got the taint of humiliating landslide loss is all. I'll be lucky if I'm just relegated to that little, uh, you know, that nice factoid in the future, first Black president, when I expect folks are going to rather forget I existed. I can't imagine a post-racial America would look too good having dumped their first Black man like this.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Won't look too good in the history textbooks. Not much of a feel good story.”</p><p>“Right, well I've got people on my lines, too. I don't know how in the name of God this could happen. I really don't. Jesus Christ, ever since Lehman it has just been shit.”</p><p>Obama leaned back in his chair and huffed. “I'd rather not think about that right now, David. About, uh, legacy. I don't have that luxury anymore. In your case I can only hope you've got some, um, Plan B after all this. At least for you, maybe most Americans don't know who you are. I don't know how I will avoid the infamy.”</p><p>Axelrod combed his sausage fingers through his receding hair. “Well, I came in, because for some reason, I don't know, I got a line on this Obama phone here.” He picked it out of his suit jacket, dangling it in the air. “Some...guy. He dropped it on my desk at the beginning of the day. Wouldn't say his name either. They were even using some voice modifier, I think. Jesus, Barry, what is this? Are you...you're not actually some kind of...I don't know... too be frank, I probably don't want to.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Obama reached out an open hand. “Just give it here, David. Some things you were kept out of the loop for, for your, uh, own peace of mind.”</p><p>Rubbing his temples with one hand, Axelrod dropped the cheap, throwaway phone in his boss's, before leaving the room, defeatedly. Pulling the phone to his ear, Obama nonchalantly answered.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“I'm sure you saw the returns.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It isn't your fault. It's ours.

Anderson Cooper was reflecting on a swing in favor of the Republicans. They had several congressional races edge out their way. Indiana was being closely watched. Montana, too.

A few months difference, that's all it could've took.</p><p>“Yeah, you're, uh, right, David.” He dusted himself off and gave it a rest, feeling it best to stop dwelling over the finer details.</p><p>Axelrod sensed it right to inject an air of levity to the situation and supplement his boss with a warm exchange, but decided against it at the last second, so he just stood there for a few additional seconds waiting for Obama to say something. When he didn't, Axelrod tried to jump to a conversation starter to change the subject, but found it hard thinking of something that could take the mind off of an election that would lead to the eviction of him and his family. Then he remembered.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, Barry,” he took out a cheap throwaway phone from out his suit jacket, “some, guy, he gave me this earlier today. He looked kinda odd...”</p><p>Axelrod tried to remember what it was about the man, he felt like there was something transparently strange about him, but the misplaced hope of victory from earlier that evening gave way to an absent-minded sense of displacement that he didn't pay it much mind. So he had forgot up until now.</p><p>“I don't even know how he got the credentials to be here, to be honest.”</p><p> Obama reached out and took it from his subordinate's grasp. “Thanks, David. I'll take it from here.” He signaled for Axelrod to leave the room, which he gladly accepted.</p><p>Closing the door, Obama sat back down and dialed the only number available, before putting it to his ear.</p><p>“Speaking.”</p><p>“Guess we can call this a wrap.”</p><p>“There's still the possibilty of...” Obama peered at the television screen again, he must've missedwhen they declared Bachmann the winner. He was a bit thankful for being spared that humiliation.</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>“It was a good effort, and we'll grant you that, but we didn't recruit you just so it could all fall apart. You're a smart man, Barack. You know better than to expect a congratulations for giving it your all. We had an agreement, an arrangement. You failed to make good on that, and we'll pay the consequences that'll be ushered in by your failure to succeed.”</p><p>“I'm not, uh, asking for your pity or a participation trophy, you can stop with the implication I am.” This looked to be devolving into a lecture.</p><p>“Stop acting hostile and listen, Barack. This wasn't a game to us as it may've been for you. You can retire and live a comfortable life, you got your end of the bargain. We'll live another story, everyone we're fighting for will live another story, with the reality of the world you've created. You did some good so we can see you'd still be able to recognize that. You have a lot to make up for, and this pitiful sobbing over a loss that never should've been isn't going to cut it.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“So, listen up. We want you to go out there and concede, but following that, we expect you to start paying your dues. We need you to direct the...”</p><p>Obama hung up, opened a window behind him, and casually dropped the phone out of it before turning back around to see Michelle.</p><p>“Oh, uh, Michelle. Sorry.”</p><p>Michelle shook her head slightly. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen.

Would rather pour myself in gasoline then get tangled with Republicans.”</p><p>Axelrod was curious who was on the phone. Was it Boehner? Was he negotiating somehow? He had to know. “Barry, who are you talking to?”</p><p>Obama tried to swat him away, making a throat slash motion in an attempt to dissuade him from asking. The line on the other end had caught wind and had a curiosity form themselves. “What's going on? Who are you speaking to?”</p><p>Obama sighed and closed his eyes. “Axelrod. David Axelrod.”</p><p>Axelrod raised an eyebrow. He hoped he wasn't throwing a wrench into his boss's plans, what almost certainly had to be an ingenious Machiavellian power-grab of proportions not seen in American history prior. He was ready to leave and allow him the luxury of peace and quiet in his efforts.</p><p>“Let me speak to him.”</p><p>Obama hesitated at first, but felt he may as well. There wasn't much else to lose. He reached out his hand and gestured Axelrod over, despite the doubt nagging, harassing the back of his mind that he'll need to call a janitor in to mop a certain color of red out from the walls once the call concluded.</p><p>Axelrod bent over and spoke into the phone, greatly confused. “H-hello?”</p><p>“Mr. Axelrod.”</p><p>“Yeah, I'm David Axelrod. Who is this?”</p><p>The phone emitted an ear-piercing screech. Obama and Axelrod coiled in pain as their ears were stung with the piercing noise. Mercifully, it let up, and the voice returned to clarity.</p><p>“Answer the question, porky.”</p><p>Axelrod was slightly discombobulated and nearly fell over, leaning over Obama's desk, he rapidly blinked his eyes and attempted to refocus his attention to the call.</p><p>“The Electoral College, in Obama's current state, where would that land us?”</p><p>“Uh, s-sir, the, the Electoral College, it's...” Axelrod was on the brink of fainting, but held on, “...under the control of the Republicans.” He chose to lay on the floor. “The...the Electoral College, when it ties, like it just did, it goes to the House of Representatives. The Republicans...control... the House...”</p><p>“I see.” The voice from the phone didn't attempt to conceal their disappointment. “You still there?”</p><p>“What the hell was that?”</p><p>“A little something some friends are cooking in Cuba. It's in early stages right now, but it's making good progress. You'll be fine. Now can you speak?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah, let me, take you off speaker.”</p><p>Axelrod rolled over and decided to rest, his breathing heavy and labored. “Uuh.”</p><p>Obama took the phone off speaker and returned it close to his ear, although now with much hesitation. “So this is it, I guess.”</p><p>“So close, yet so far. We'll never have the opportunity we had when you started again. The chance to remake the economic structure of the banking system, to seize control of the corporate husks of the Democratic Party with their supermajority and dictate their actions with your every command. God. What we could've done. That's all gone now.”</p><p>Obama went over to lift Axelrod onto a chair to sit down and catch his breath, before returning to his business. He fiddled with the phone a little and huffed. “Suppose we're through?”</p><p>“An astute observation, your professorial skills are hard at work tonight seemingly. Do us a favor and dispose of the phone. You won't like what it does when you leave it hanging around.”</p><p>Obama's eyes widened and nostrils flared, he quickly took notice and threw the phone out of the window, watching it plummet before it combusted into a fiery flame as it hit the concrete below. He pulled his head out back inside to see Michelle standing there, peering at Axelrod unconscious in the chair over.</p><p>“Barry, are you okay? David! David...is he okay?”</p><p>Waving his hand nonchalantly, Obama shook his head. “Don't worry, he, um, uh, he's, tuckered out. The, uh, situation got to him a bit.”</p><p>Michelle shrugged her shoulders and walked over. “Sorry,” Obama said. “Don't apologize.”</p><p>Hugging one another, Obama looked over Michelle's shoulder at the results being reported on the screen. Maybe it wasn't time for a call now, but it soon would be.</p>`)

Parents lifted their children high above their shoulders to see the television screens broadcasting the victory of the first Black president. The first Black president, who like the first white man in the office that he occupied, won everything. It was more than a landslide, they were seeing history in the making. This was no mere man, this was a legend.</p><p>You only needed one word for them, the great men of history: Caesar. Napoleon. Washington. Gandhi. Obama.</p><p>This country, a racist country, built on the backs of men and women with the skin color of him, he held it in his fist. Puddy. He was a god now. They have paid recognition to the majesty he bestowed upon them, with his mere presence. He didn't need feats nor accomplishments that would define him or hog the limelight. He just existed. He was that great. He was Barack Hussein Obama and he had just become the first president in the history of the United States to truly win an election through unanimous consent. No meddling needed. Far beyond that of the votes of the white landed gentry. This was real. He had ascended and the country below him was enveloped beneath his feet, in the shadow of a giant.</p><p>Obama had his feet propped up on the Resolute Desk, ahead of him Biden and Clinton cowered at his immense legend. His word would be bond. They were only peasants in his godly presence. Obama was picking the lobster out from his teeth. Enjoying the celebration as he was justly owed on the way back from Chicago, sampling Michelin Guide-worthy meals, popping confetti and laughing it up with the respectable company of Rahm and Axelrod, the plane ride was enough to intoxicate the president in the atmosphere, but far be it for him to prove susceptible to the adoration of others. He only required that of his own. It was all he had left.</p><p>“I believe you two know why I've assembled the two of you today,” Obama started. “2016. Who I'd grant the, uh. Pleasure. The pleasure of becoming my successor in this office.”</p><p>If he had it his way, he'd serve another term. He could serve as president for life. There proved no need to delegate the duties of the office to others as he was forced to do, but really, he didn't mind. Sure. He would like to have some say in the governing, but this truly bored him. The governing. It was all too dirty. Rather than that, he was owed the title of king and the ability to rule by decree. It was only then he could see continuing to spare the prime of his life to the nation, more so than he already had. Rather than that, he didn't mind it a whole lot.</p><p>“Joseph,” Obama suddenly uttered. Biden rose to his feet. Obama gestured for him to sit. “Down. Joseph. Sit.” Biden slowly backed down and giddily sat himself down in his chair. Clinton looked like she would when they'll open her casket for viewing. “I've been, uh, honored, to have you by my side these past four years,” Obama tried not to corpse, “and truly, without you I doubt I'd have managed to get where I am today,” alright, he was pushing it now, let's wrap this up.</p><p>“I would love it if you could serve after me, and, um, uh, be my choice come 2016.”</p><p>Biden simply got up. Obama was partially shocked at the sudden burst of action the decrepit old man was managing, but was simply too enamored with himself to conjure that ability right now. He just blankly stared at him, every move of Biden's he kept thinking of only himself and his future, or of the crowds and mass gatherings of applause he'd receive, the awards and titles, the statues and the places and buildings that would be graced with the privilege of adorning his name. Where was he? Or, yes, Biden was coming around the desk towards him.</p><p>Biden got on his knees and began kissing Obama's shoes. “Thank you, sir,” he kissed the rubbery tips again, “thank you.” Obama reflexively lifted his arm and head. “That'll do, Joseph.” Biden once again kowtowed before arising and scurrying back to his chair. Clinton was a puddle. This was the end of her road, and she needed to reflect on that. Glancing wistfully at the the desk she held aspirations of chairing over, the only solace was the comfort she could try once more when she was 80.</p><p>“Oh, and Hillary,” Obama broke her masturbatory train of thought, “don't gather any ideas of going against me, now.” He laughed.</p><p>Clinton followed suit, croaking out a mild, forced chuckle. “Never, Mr. President.” She'd've preferred Obama telling her to go fuck herself over this charade of faux pleasantries. If she could go back in time, and alter this course of history, she would do it in an instant. Damn him. Damn him to hell.</p><p>Obama rose up as Biden continued kissing his feet. “Alright, Joseph, stop the groveling now, get up,” Obama picked him up from the back of his collar and stood him up. Biden adjusted himself and combed back his hairplugs to look more presentable. “Of course, Mr. President.” The two marched onward out of the office and into the hallowed halls of the White House. Blessed to have had within it the Obama family. Meanwhile, Clinton continued to stare onward, in the darkness of the night sky, which had begun to seep out from the Washington atmosphere and into the Oval Office, enveloping her whole.</p>`)

She took a big risk, it could've all fallen apart, but the opposite would occur. This was a blessing in disguise, and now with the foundation laid, she had the world in the palm of her hand. Biden merely accepted his fate, as if his tenure in politics had been Old Yeller and Obama was polishing his shotgun. He just stared with a blank, emotionless expression as the two kept speaking like he wasn't even there. “I'd be honored if you were the, uh, one, to carry the torch into 2016. For me.”</p><p>Clinton flashed her gums and veneers, eyes closed, head slightly raised as if she was being blessed with the bright light of Heaven's pearly gates. This was about as close as she was to experiencing that ever happening, so she made sure to enjoy every last second of it. When she was finally done, she looked back down and readied herself to respond.</p><p>“Of course, Mr. President, I'd love to,” Clinton got up and was ready to shake his hand. Obama failed to acknowledge the gesture and just stared at her for a moment. Yes, he was calling it the 'passing of the torch,' but he meant it more metaphorically. He had every intention of this being to his exact specifications. No, this wasn't Hillary's ambition, it was his; by denying her this satisfaction, it'd be a reflective of his expectations for the future. Clinton noticed this, and quickly deciphered what he had been getting at. She smiled and sat back down. “Thank you, again.”</p><p>Biden continued rotting in the chair next to them, amounting to the same amount of consequence as the Oval Office drapes had to the present situation.</p><p>Obama got up and, without even so much as a prompt, Clinton shot up and joined him. Never had this been thought possible, but Clinton was merely an apprentice to the true expert. A greenhorn no more, as she originally thought of him. He was a genius, and in his ever-gracious intellect, he was granting her the privilege of his tutelage. She'd be watching the next four years of his masterful administrative work very, very closely, in preparation for her own to succeed him. They made their way out, flicking the lightswitch off and proceeding further into the belly of the White House.</p><p>Was there someone else in the room? They had forgot. Doubtless, it held little importance to their plans for the future.</p>`)

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address those still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise.

As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue.

e.pages.push(`<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address those still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness.

e.pages.push(`<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address those still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up.

No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from.

But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>`)          // idk how to add playlists but to do that you create a new playlist in code1 with just that song and put changePlaylist(nameOfYourEndingPlaylist) right here

Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016.

          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure.

e.pages.push(`<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
          <p>Jubilant.</p><p>It was jubilant in Chicago. But not for Obama. His win was impressive, he had won states never thought possible to snatch up from his opponent. Every poindexter and geek who'd bother to care about what color a map looked like was sure to ascertain this as a stunning rebuke of his opponent and a testament to the skill and talent he possessed. But Obama already knew that, he didn't need a large enough electoral margin to validate that of which he was already certain of, that he was truly a great man.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>`)          // idk how to add playlists but to do that you create a new playlist in code1 with just that song and put changePlaylist(nameOfYourEndingPlaylist) right here

          <p>Revolutionary.</p><p>It was revolutionary in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle.

The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Revolutionary.</p><p>It was revolutionary in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address those still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Barack. Barack...excuse me...” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a variety of portraits demonstrating a concoction of disbelief and anger. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...fucking invalid you have sat across from me. Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. You fucking idiot. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, fuck you.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable. He didn't want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk as in a playful manner. Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

Obama didn't think he'd grow so fond of this old man, his odd quirks and archaic way of thinking. Sure, he was something of the old world. He still believed in institutions, that the other side could be negotiated with. That would be a problem; but still, it wouldn't prove impossible to fix. Obama thought of some solutions as to how, and he figured, if he helped him out early, got him over the finish line, he could sneak his people in early. No separation between 'Biden people' and 'Obama people' that might cause a rift in communication. Deprive Obama of influence if Biden ever managed to make it on his own. No, this was the way. This was the direction he knew he needed to take.</p><p>“Oh, that right,”  Obama found himself genuinely laughing at his number two's folksy demeanor, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, which she had failed to impact in any meaningful way. No, it had went badly. The administration she had served was one of consistent failure, be that in operation or belief system. She could hardly continue parading around in it with the way Obama had been acting, it was everything she had feared. She wouldn't go so far as to say Obama might actually be some radical thinker in the same light as Bill Ayers or Louis Farrakhan that she made sure to consistently imply and dog-whistle, and helped inspire McCain to preach wholeheartedly, back in '08. Yet, she'd be lying if she said she didn't maintain some real concerns that Obama was, in the most generous sense, an idiot. An idealistic idiot, who held the belief that he was this revolutionary warrior out to restructure the capitalist system. The thought this was the reality of the situation made her light-headed.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room. Obama and Biden stared at her for what felt like a minute but was just 10 seconds.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, the arrogant crow thought she was going to get this job on a silver platter. As if Obama would forget so easily. Biden got slightly giddy, his right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Joe, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we're be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Okay. Alright.” Clinton's leathery face crinkled into a million wrinkles as her face expressed a concoction of portraits all expressing varying degrees of disbelief. She did not hitch her ride to this bullshit administration, stand idly by as Obama implemented idiotic policies and projects with the full expectation she'd be rewarded at the end of it all. She did not sign up for this. “Barack...I'd like to speak to you, in private where I can express my feelings on this, this hasty decision you're making now...”</p><p>Obama clasped his hands together and listened as Clinton droned on, unable to complete her sentence. Biden was amused. He was getting everything he had ever wanted, that, and for once he wasn't the one stuttering into a discombobulated state during a one-on-one conversation.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Hillary. I'm granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to take a course of action that would violate my, uh, authority on this issue. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage me, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Jo-, well maybe not Joe, but, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Hillary, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Hillary.”</p><p>Clinton's faux laugh had turned into genuine laughter now. Obama felt his authority being denied the ultimate reverence he felt it was owed. Instead, she just sat there, laughing. After what was actually a minute this time, she wiped her tears and spoke up.</p><p>“You're not doing a damn thing to decide how I act in 2016, <i>Barry</i>. You, nor that...invalid you have sat across from me. Sorry, Joe. No offense.”</p><p>“Oh, of course, Hillary, none taken.”</p><p>“And Pelosi sure as shit isn't going to involve herself. Are you serious, right now? Threatening me in this manner? You won a second term, you're not the fucking king of the party now, Barack. You have some damn nerve, but I am just so amused by it all. No, you're going to find out quickly you're a small fish in a big pond who knows how to get a crowd riled up. There's little else going on with you, it's about time someone told you that.”</p><p>It appeared to be the case that his attempt at some light intimidation was backfiring in spectacular fashion; Obama was worried now. Biden looked very uncomfortable, he didn't want to cause a fuss nor did he want a battle for the nomination, even if it was one where he'd get a fair hand in fighting. He was never good at genuine primary battles, he flamed out hard in '88 and was little more than a distraction in '08, only remembered for a gimmicky, unoriginal comeback he tried to coin against Rudy Giuliani and for being saved from political irrelevancy by the real winner.</p><p>“If that was all, I'm going to go now.” Clinton got ready to leave, all but certain her claim to the nomination come 2016 remained assured, and she'd smash Joe Biden like an ant. It might even work out for her, beating a dementia-addled joke of an opponent over someone of real ideological fiber who could divide the party. Yes, this was better than an Obama endorsement, much better.</p><p>“Wait, uh, Hillary. We aren't finished here, come back and si-” Clinton opened the door, still laughing, exiting the office she intended to return to behind her.</p><p>Obama and Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving them in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Obama and Biden slowly looked up into it, finally enveloped whole.</p>`)

          <p>Revolutionary.</p><p>It was revolutionary in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that come with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address those still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod was in a heated contest with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, and he had every right to be. As the vice president, he had a perfect route to succeed the president. He just needed a little extra push to get him there. And he was going to get it.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along. “Sure was, Jack.

Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required.

He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise.

The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>`)          // idk how to add playlists but to do that you create a new playlist in code1 with just that song and put changePlaylist(nameOfYourEndingPlaylist) right here

He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously.

          <p>Revolutionary.</p><p>It was revolutionary in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>`)          // idk how to add playlists but to do that you create a new playlist in code1 with just that song and put changePlaylist(nameOfYourEndingPlaylist) right here

The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>`)          // idk how to add playlists but to do that you create a new playlist in code1 with just that song and put changePlaylist(nameOfYourEndingPlaylist) right here

    e.pages.push(`<h3>Nobody is Above the Law</h3>
              <p>The International Criminal Court had eagerly anticipated the transfer of detainees George Walker Bush, Richard Bruce Cheney, Donald Henry Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice to the United Nations Detention Unit in Scheveningen, The Hague. The Obama administration's decision to direct the DOJ to charge the four, among other lieutenants and lower-level staffers and officials, with war crimes relating to the 2003 invasion of Iraq was controversial, to say the least. Protests erupted, though small in number. The photos of a former president being escorted away into custody drew international attention, and laid the foundation for what would become the greatest prison outbreak of all time.</p><p>Bush was carving childrens' icons into the brick walls of his confinement. He had perfected the illustrations of Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny to a degree of such fine impeccability he could effectively kick the bricks out and have an arguable case be made for a job application as a cartoonist. The pitter-patter of the water drip being made by Cheney just below him was effectively concealed by the sound Bush would make slamming his chisel into the wall. A guard moved over and peered between the bars of his cell, overlooking him adding Daffy Duck to his growing collection.</p><p>“Alright, George,” the guard dragged his baton across the bars, “give it a rest with the drawing. Hand over the chisel or I'll get you sent to solitary.” Bush looked over, tapped his chisel two times subtly on the stainless steel leg of his cot, and rolled it over through the bars and into the hands of the guard. He flashed a smile. “My bad, chief.” The guard pocketed it, cocking a single eyebrow before moving on with his patrol.</p><p>Bush scurried over to the drainage pipe of his sink. He took out a small piece of paper and wrote something down using a tiny piece of pencil lead he had stuffed into his sock, before attaching it to a tiny piece of string and rolling it through the lead pipe that traveled down through to the floor. He kept pushing it down until he heard a barely audible <small>*clink*</small> that let him know when to stop. He let go of the string and walked back to where he had been sitting, doodling his cartoons.</p><p>Below his cell, under the next floor, Cheney was cranking a water valve he had managed to dig under and into beneath the concrete floor he routinely paced over. He had managed to bust a hole right through into the sewage pipe that traveled underneath The Hague's prison complex, largely configured to space wide enough for the collective waste of every prisoner in the facility, but also just large enough that it might accommodate the four criminals' escape. He heard someone approaching, and quickly jumped out and laid down his emergency map of the Middle East, topped with tiny flags placed throughout it for the best spots for ExxonMobil and Halliburton to seek investment in following troop orders. He started studying the topography of it as the guard peered over.</p><p>“You criminal bastard, still finding glory in your conquests?” Cheney barely turned just to say, “fuck off.” The guard spit on the ground before walking away.</p><p>Once he was confident the guard had moved away, Cheney took out a makeshift radio constructed out of the discarded and smashed pieces of an older model made as promotional material for Ang Lee's 2003 <i>Hulk</i> that he repaired using bubblegum and some old Silly Bandz. He radioed in. “This is Angler. I repeat, this is Angler. Is the line set?”</p><p>The radio crinkled a tiny bit, emitting the voice of Rumsfeld on the other end. “This is Infinite Justice. The line is set, waiting for your call.” He nodded, then brandished an X-ACTO knife form his boot. “Copy that. Let the others know, the plan is a-go.”</p><p>It was eight hours later, the plan was in operation.</p><p>Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rice were marching through in single-order line through the raw bacterial gunk of the many imprisoned war criminals' behinds on their way to freedom. They crawled out, just a little over two feet from the prison encampment, and into a nearby waste disposal pit. They plopped out and, under the stream of rain, basked in the return to the outside world. But the bliss was short-lived, as suddenly, the alarms of the prison began to blare. The four turned and in a panic got ready to set their course for the nearest train depot to cap off their escape. Quickly brushing the crap off their bright orange jumpsuits, they prepared to make their exit. And yet, Cheney placed his hand on Bush's chest.</p><p>“No, they expect one of us in the shit pit brother.”</p><p>“Have we started the fire?” Bush asked.</p><p>“Yes. The fire rises.”</p>`)

              <p>Air date - November 2, 2014 | Season 1, Episode 23</p><p><b>Episode Transcript</b></p><p>OLIVER: Our subject for the night is the TPP. And no, contrary to popular belief, TPP is not an acronym for Titanium Toilet Paper used when The Charmin Bears need some extra-reinforcement for their arses. That's right. You know how they are in fact colour-coded based on the toilet paper they're hawking? Well, these bears' colour is Xanadu green. Why Xanadu green? Because these bears have a one-track mind, and when they have their Charmin supply, they're rushing out of grocery stores carrying only whatever was in the closest vicinity of their Charmin toilet paper. The cereal aisle. You heard me, that's right. And when you're eating nothing but high-fructose corn syrup cereal, you'll wish you had some Titanium Toilet Paper.</p><p>[<i>Audience laughs and cheers</i>]</p><p>What we're instead talking about is the Trans-Pacific Partnership otherwise abbreviated to the TPP.</p><p>[<i>Cut to stock footage</i>]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The Obama administration has announced their fast-tracking of the Trans-Pacific Partnership has gone off without a hitch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: President Barack Obama was happy to announce today the successful fast-tracking of the TPP in the East Room with representatives from participating countries and members of Congress.</p><p>OBAMA: Today is a, uh, grand day, as we take this leap forward with our global allies in unshackling restrictions on trade between our countries.</p><p>[<i>Cut back to Oliver in-studio</i>]</p><p>OLIVER: Now this is a long-time coming. Back in 2010, President Obama fast-tracked measures through Congress ensuring the ability to ratify the TPP into law. Now we're seeing the final stage of ratification where Obama has gathered the involved countries and will give the trade pact full approval as they provide their signatures to the deal this week.</p><p>[<i>Cut to stock footage</i>]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The TPP is the largest trade deal in history. Some of the largest countries in the world including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Japan have joined in, while excluding China with hopes of putting the pressure on them to start cooperating better. The Obama administration is expected to get it enshrined by the end of this week.</p><p>OBAMA: We've worked together as an administration to get our country working again! Out from the recession and into a renewal of growth!</p><p>CARNEY: The important thing to consider about this is the benefits involved when it comes to an increase in our economic future over a period of time...[<i>jumpcut</i>]...this will eliminate tariffs with the dairy industry here, and for telecommunication services in Vietnam and with other industries in these participating countries where we can start welcoming in some fair play.</p><p>[<i>Cut back to Oliver in-studio</i>]</p><p>OLIVER: Sounds good, right? There are legitimate concerns when it comes to Chinese practices such as depressing their own currency or skirting rules instituted by the World Trade Organization, and the general premise of this trade deal sounds promising for an increase in economic output, the creation of jobs, but there are those sounding the alarm.</p><p>[<i>Cut to stock footage</i>]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Speaker Pelosi has announced her personal opposition to the White House's push for TPP approval, silently rallying Democrats to oppose President Obama's legislation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: President Obama's gamble to get approval through Congress for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has managed to gain an unexpected foe in Speaker Pelosi, but an unexpected ally with Republicans, including House Minority Leader John Boehner.</p><p>SANDERS: Our past trade agreements have failed workers and led to the loss of millions of jobs, the TPP will join this record and help reward countries, countries that abuse their workforce, pay 0.56 cents an hour in countries like Vietnam, and you put workers in America in direct competition with those who are paid 0.56 an hour...[<i>jumpcut</i>]...the abundance of cheap labor in these countries have attracted American companies to go overseas, and if we pass this it'll make it even easier for these same companies to close the doors of their factories here and bleed these other countries dry for dirt cheap.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED UNION LEADER: Trumka said it best himself, when this thing goes through we'll see NAFTA on steroids.</p><p>[<i>Cut back to Oliver in-studio, the audience gasps</i>]</p><p>OLIVER: Yeah. NAFTA. Maybe the worst thing you thought you loved back in the 90s, but didn't understand the full extent of, to get reminded about.</p><p>[<i>A picture of Bill Cosby appears on the side</i>]</p><p>OLIVER: Okay, second worst.</p><p>[<i>The audience laughs</i>]</p><p>OLIVER: But, seriously considering the full extent of this trade agreement. The TPP is big. The largest of its kind. And there are some major issues in the details of this, elements that may prove truly problematic in only the near future. And it goes farther than that of manufacturing jobs. It erases regulations on unsafe products and toxic emissions. The pharmaceutical industry and Republicans are ride or die when it comes to this, and it's plain to see why that is. Nobody wants corporations to begin running rampant unfettered, like they were Janice from accounting when your place of employment hosts an all you can eat Chipotle buffet...LEAVE SOME FOR US JANICE. LEAVE SOME FOR US. SHE DON'T GIVE A FUCK. SHE DON'T GIVE A FUCK.</p><p>[<i>Audience bursts into mass laughter and applause</i>]</p>`)

              <p>10:34 AM, March 21st, 2013</p><p>By Mike Allen</p><p>After President Barack Obama's re-election in 2012, the consensus was that he would use the (relative) goodwill in Congress and the honeymoon period to get through some easy-to-pass legislation, adding to his repertoire of domestic accomplishments alongside his alignment-changing appointments to the Supreme Court or passage of the public option.</p><p>Instead, Obama is pushing through a comprehensive bill that'll seek to pass large reparations for Black Americans who are descendants of slaves. It was first announced in his <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>State of the Union</u></span> last week, where he announced the Post-Slavery Reparations Program for Black Americans (read the bill <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>here.</u></span>), and it has since faced a barrage of opposition in Congress, but also strong support when it comes to Democratic leadership.</p><p> “I've heard from the paper the Republicans are throwing a big fit over it,” South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn said. “It's only natural, when you do a crime, you have to pay the fine. I don't see anything wrong with what we're working towards.”</p><p>Apart from Republicans, conservative Democrats have been aghast at the proposition. Senator Joe Manchin has avoided all questions regarding it, and many House members of the Blue Dog Coalition have rejected it outright. “It's patently discriminatory,” Utah's Jim Matheson said to media outlets following the president's decision to put this through Congress.</p><p><b>What it is:</b> The Post-Slavery Reparations Program for Black Americans, introduced as H.R. 40 by John Conyers in the House, would establish a governmental office to investigate claims for reparations and plan payouts from a $11 trillion fund that would be established by Congress.</p><p><b>Will it pass?</b> Despite <span style="color:lightblue;">opposition</span> from numerous conservative Democrats in the House and Senate, Obama has undertaken a massive lobbying effort to promote it, one of the more notable examples being a <span style="color:lightblue;">feeble-looking</span> Biden touring Capitol Hill to promote it.</p><p>In the end, President Obama has put himself in a precarious position regarding his political capital, but pulling off not only the planning board, but securing funding for it, it would cement the Democratic Party as a party of his own. With the top brass firmly behind him, and support from rank-and-file members at an all-time high, even amid the backlash from Republicans and a sizable chunk of independents alike, little doubt exists the president doesn't have a long political future as a party boss ahead of him even when his newest term expires.</p><p>“I don't recognize this as my party,” said Matheson, “but I sure do recognize it as his.”</p>`)

              <p>By <u>Miranda Hayes</u> — June 12, 2023</p><p><i>Dr. Miranda Hayes is a columnist for EducationWeek and an expert on the subject of school choice and charter schools.</i></p><p>California has become the last state in the union to give its approval towards taxpayer-funded vouchers for private and religious school attendance. The news would've come as something of a political tsunami to someone only a decade ago, but now the modern reality as Governor Gavin Newsom signs off on the plan is only the culmination of years of work towards helping to introduce the touchy subject to a wider audience in the United States.</p><p>The presidential entrepreneurialism of the Barack Obama years continue to reap the rewards of its government expenditures aiming to help promote and grow the private education system in the United States. Not thought possible previously, even states like California have fallen sway to the charm of the influx of federal cash possible if only states start adopting the White House's thought; whether we're speaking of former or future, it would prove redundant, as they've all adopted similar policy viewpoints on how competition can aide in the progress behind American youth's development in the K-12 climate.</p><p>Shortly following his reelection, President Obama helped sign a successor to his early term legislation Race to the Top (RTTT), in many ways it adopted various components from RTTT and merely helped to expand and strengthen the crux behind it. Similar to how RTTT broadened the scope of how standardized test scores factored into the ways in which school districts statewide would receive government funding, high-performing charter schools saw lucrative gains with the boost that was supplied in the expanded definitions of RTTT's categorical phases.</p><p>In the most basic sense, Obama's new initiative, coined the Betterment for Broadened Growth (BBG), encouraged Common Core standards to a much greater compacity than was originally realized prior, with curriculums structured around the best ways teachers can adapt their lesson plans to better fit the “teaching to the test” framework. It was bold, wide-sweeping, and ambitious, even if on surface-level seemingly mundane. The passage of it managed to even fade under the headlines at the time, even as it garnered strong bipartisan support, a rarity in the modern day.</p><p>With BBG seeing passage, applicants to the program more than doubled compared to RTTT, which saw thirty-five states including the District of Columbia apply. Come BBG, almost the entire nation jumped into the fray, with hundreds of millions awarded to the winners. Even states that opted not to apply in the contests of RTTT or BBG implemented policies that corresponded to a similar volume as those who had.</p><p>Following the implementation of both programs, tax credits for private-school scholarship programs have soared to heights never seen prior. Voucher programs, once thought a deeply contentious partisan issue, has become accepted rhetoric among both members of the Republican and Democratic parties, as Pennsylvania under its Governor Josh Shapiro and Arkansas under its Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders both seeing fit to push their pet projects over the line to help aide such ventures. Shapiro has yet to go as far as Sanders, who has not only fought hard in favor of voucher programs' expansion, but taken steps to gradually phase out the Arkansas Department of Education entirely, though that remains a hotly contested issue even still. But in Sanders's favor, it might just be the next path forward.</p>`)

              <p><small><b>Robert Reich</b></small></p><p><small>Jun 06, 2023</small></p><p>❤ 1,138 ⚇ 148</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Gy9sTi0.png></p><p>Friends,</p><p>It's only been a decade since President Barack Obama sought to expand the Supreme Court via executive order, an action which, inevitably, didn't lead to anything.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Since that day on January 21, 2013, only a day after his second inauguration when President Obama made his mission, and thus the Democrats' mission as a whole, known, the issue has proved contentious, but overtime become a much more digestible argument (what some may call a shifting of the Overton window as is popularly phrased on the internet) that has been able to sway even those who would normally be aghast. Today we see the presidential candidates speaking openly on the subject, with many Democratic contenders affirming they'd keep true to the pledge of seeking to accomplish Obama's original wish.</p><p>The initial executive order would fall through quickly, being challenged by virtually every lawmaker on the Republican aisle and not recognized by any impartial authority on the matter. That's the moment his party picked up where he left off, with Representative Maxine Waters introducing legislation that would actually remake the face of the SCOTUS, legislation which would add justices and require a supermajority on the bench to overturn any federal law. That also died rather fast. The matter seemed to fall apart, and at the sacrifice of a non-negligible hit to his personal popularity, Obama would seek what many critics of his left had always said was a fatal flaw looming over his legacy: a lack of a real domestic (also foreign, but that's neither here nor there) achievement.</p><p>Yes, the public option, for what is was, was big. Certainly. However, change cannot satisfy itself on crumbs, what was demanded of him was to push that envelope further. In this context, the public option was one thing, but what if, down the line, a Republican trifecta emerged? A lot of vacancies would open on the Court right at that time? The gradual erosion of the achievement Obama helped cement would be only a matter of time, a few years, maybe a decade or two, but it would like many things we've seen in our time become an issue of potential evaporation (i.e. female bodily autonomy, gun control, foreign policy doctrines). None of this is ever left a guaranteed staying power just because a president and a Congress at the time passed it, many things like it have been done away with if only because public sentiment failed to maintain its long-term sustainability.</p><p>With all that being said, let's return to the matter at hand. Obama's quest to expand the Court, like that of another Democratic president long ago (I am of course referring to Franklin Delano Roosevelt if you didn't catch my meaning), was of heavy consequence out of the gate, many Republicans made it an issue. But with something of a surprising skill that even shocked me, the presidential administration failed to budge when it came to dropping the matter entirely. Like it had been possessed, or some shadowy cabal had seen fit to do what needed to be done and almost puppeteer Obama around, he spoke of such strong and principled passion that it effectively refused to go away. No. When you thought Obama, you thought 'when is that damn Court going to get reformed?'</p><p>With baby steps turning to a brisk walk come marathon running, we've reached our sprint. As I speak, the Democrats in the majority of both Houses are working diligently in passing the legislation that Roosevelt and Obama wished to see come to reality years prior. The hoopla and anger from the various spectrums of the political scene are converging upon Washington this week: pro-choicers, anti-choicers, pro-gun, anti-gun, LGBTQ, hateful churchgoers, all you could expect that have some stake in this contest are here and they're yelling, loud. With the vote in the House expected to clear easily, the only mountain left to climb now lies at the Senate, expected to end in a tight finish. If it succeeds, we can expect President Michelle Obama to, of course, give it her full blessing, and we'll have reached the end of our long national nightmare.</p><p><b>But, hey, I don't want to jinx it.</b></p><p><center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uKLXcG4.png></center></p>`)

Turning to our guest Senator Harry Reid, we're ready to ask him on whether Obama, in a complete turn from 2008 where he had the ear of the voters and beat Hillary, the complete opposite now, and whether that reflects something deeper in the party itself.

Joe Biden would come out an hour later, and bore a face of determined anger. Ricchetti placed his hand on his shoulder and told him his services would always be available to his employer, only for the vice president to turn back and say: ''Good. Because I'm going to need you for this upcoming campaign, Steve.'' <i>The Last Stand: Inside the Doomed Campaign of Biden 2016</i> chronicles the bombastic, flailing and all-around captivating primary campaign ran by Joe Biden against the establishment pick, former Secretary Hillary Clinton. Through the twists and turns present, <i>The New Yorker</i>'s Henry Gallagher maintains vivid detail of the thought process dictating Biden's decision-making, from the fateful day President Barack Obama crushed Biden's lifelong ambitions to serve to a destiny-defining meeting held between Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Biden in Washington that ushered in a clandestine alliance between the two old men. Gallagher is able to juggle the various conflicting accounts that would emerge from the time such as a falsehood of Biden wishing to remain out of the race following his son's death, the depths that the two contenders would stoop to in their respective smear campaigns, and the extent to which the Obama White House conspired to aide the Clinton campaign to win despite a faux veil of neutrality. Would Biden have won the general election where Clinton failed? What insights can Gallagher provide into Biden's future? All these questions and more are explored. This book is required reading for any political junkie wanting the true scoop on the current behind-the-scenes power struggle that remains the bane of the post-Obama Democratic Party.</p><p><i>Correction: An earlier version of this review misstated who Biden had spoke to at the beginning.</i></p><p><b>MORE FROM PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</b></p><p><br><center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XoUu91M.png></center><br></p>`)

              <p><center>By BILL SCHER | May 31, 2016</center></p><p><i>Bill Scher is the senior writer at the Campaign for America’s Future, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show “The DMZ” along with the Daily Caller's Matt Lewis.</i></p><p>Hillary Clinton has worked for nearly half a century to establish her bona fides on the left. In 1968, she stuffed envelopes in New Hampshire for Eugene McCarthy's anti-war presidential campaign, and four years later, she registered Texas voters for liberal icon George McGovern. During Bill Clinton's first campaign for governor in 1978, she riled traditionalists in Arkansas because she hadn't taken her husband’s last name. She had enough of a liberal fan base that in 1992, buttons read “Elect Hillary's Husband.” In 1993, she shattered the first lady mold by becoming a major policy aide with a West Wing office. In her first year, she fiercely fought the corporate health insurance lobby in her quest to enact universal health coverage. Then she allied with the liberal darling of 2008, Barack Obama, and together they both managed a comeback bid after a complete economic collapse which sought to jeopardize their fledgling administration. In 2013, she'd take her place as the United States's first female vice president.</p><p>So how did we arrive at a place today where, to some on the left, she is “the candidate of the war machine” with a “deeply pro-corporate ideology” who is “building on the legacy of Ronald Reagan.” How does one go from a symbol of women's equality and battler of corporate interests to being perceived as the personification of the corrupt intersection of corporations and government?</p><p>The short answer is her record, and the record of her husband. Her 2002 vote in the Senate to authorize an invasion of Iraq was the first big crack in her bond with the Democratic base. Her 2008 presidential campaign further alienated anti-war voters when she criticized President Barack Obama's pledge to meet with leaders of rogue states in his first year. She fed the perception of a craven, calculating politician when she gave a convoluted answer on whether undocumented immigrants should get driver's licenses. When Wall Street shenanigans tanked the global economy the following year, Bill Clinton's deregulation policies were fingered by many leftists and politically opportunistic Republicans alike, and her ties to the financial industry were put under the microscope.</p><p>But even that doesn't fully explain why Hillary Clinton doesn't have more street cred today with the progressive movement—and why she herself often appears to lack faith in it. It's an attitude, and voters notice. It's the way Clinton talks when she dismisses Sanders' ambitious proposals by saying they “just won't work” and “the numbers don’t add up.” Her squeamishness toward his desire to mobilize the grass roots behind single-payer health care (“I don't want us to start over again [and] plunge our country into a contentious debate”).</p><p>The best explanation may be deeply personal and goes back to one of the worst moments of her life: the searing experience of being entrusted with the biggest piece of her husband's domestic policy agenda in the first two years of his administration—universal health coverage—and failing totally, arguably contributing to the 1994 loss of both chambers of Congress and with it, the end of hope for an ambitious legislative legacy for herself and her husband.</p><p>As described in biography, <i>A Woman in Charge</i>, written by Carl Bernstein, the “near universal view” of White House staffers was that afterward, she sank into a deep depression. The preternaturally prepared Clinton had her confidence shaken, reportedly telling current Clinton antagonist but then-top strategist Dick Morris, “I'm so confused. I just don't know what works anymore.” However, we don't know the exact nature of her emotions because, as Bernstein writes, “Hillary appears to have kept to herself her deepest feelings about the wreckage of the twenty months between inauguration day and election day … Except for conveying her general despondency she did not even discuss with her close friends … her role in the debacle.”</p><p>Most strikingly yet rarely remembered, her health-care failure came from trying to win the battle Bernie-style: publicly attacking corporate interests and overcoming corporate influence by rallying the public behind reform.</p><p>***</p><p><b>To win in November, she doesn't need Bernie voters</b> to agree with her pragmatic approach to politics. She only needs them to believe that their disagreements are largely about tactics and scope of ambition. She needs them to believe that, at her core, she isn't a neoconservative or a tool of Wall Street.</p><p>But without filling the gap in the narrative between her youthful activism and current incrementalism, others step in to fill in the blanks. The record of the 1990s was a “total repudiation of the FDR/LBJ legacy,” and Hillary Clinton “has been taken in by a fundamentally right wing paradigm,” argued <span style="color:lightblue;">Huffington Post blogger Benjamin Studebaker</span>; never mind the higher taxes on the wealthy or the anti-poverty Earned Income Tax Credit expansion the Clintons managed to establish in the second term.</p><p>The post-presidency Clinton Foundation isn't seen as a good-faith attempt to encourage corporate social responsibility; instead, it's, in the words of <span style="color:lightblue;"><i>The Nation</i>’s Naomi Klein</span>, “part of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.”</p><p>Her relative hawkishness isn't accepted as stemming from a sincere belief in the principles of humanitarian military intervention shared by most Democratic presidents; there must be a nefarious motive. As Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs speculated, “Is it chronically bad judgment? Is it her preternatural faith in the lying machine of the CIA? Is it a repeated attempt to show that, as a Democrat, she would be more hawkish than the Republicans? Is it to satisfy her hard-line campaign financiers? Who knows?”</p><p>Depending on how old they are, different generations interpret her record differently. Democratic voters age 45 and older, more than two-thirds of whom voted for Clinton, remember when the Clintons first took the national stage in 1992. They were the Democrats who saved the Carter-Mondale-Dukakis party from political oblivion and subsequently faced down the Gingrich Revolution. Show them examples of when the Clintons veered right, and they'll remind you they did what they had to do to win, and when seemingly no other Democrat could.</p><p>Democrats younger than 30, 70 percent of whom voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, were not yet teenagers during the Bill Clinton presidency. A college student today had not been born when Hillary was going 10 rounds with the health insurance lobby. Their political awakening stems from the 2009 market crash and the Iraq War debacle, and their introduction to Hillary Clinton was her war vote, her husband's repeal of Glass-Steagall, and her boss's face associated with developing news of banks going bust. While older voters see her as a left-of-center figure weathering decades of brutal attacks while valiantly navigating the realities of Washington, younger voters are quick to tag her as the embodiment of everything wrong with the current political system.</p><p>If younger Democrats were more aware of the enmity Hillary Clinton and the health insurance lobby once had for each other, they still probably would have felt the Bern. They still would have rejected the notion that the corrosive nature of big-dollar fundraising was worth stomaching to win elections. They still would loathe Wall Street deregulation and the Iraq War vote. They still would believe only a revolution could change Washington.</p><p>But if they knew more about her personal journey, they might be more likely to view Clinton the way many view Obama: as a decent person trying to push a lot of boulders up a big Washington hill. And that might have made it a little easier for a steadfast Bernie supporter to eventually get to “I'm with her.”</p><p><b>This article tagged under:</b></p><p><u>Health Care</u>, <u>2016</u>, <u>Hillary Clinton</u>, <u>Bill Clinton</u>, <u>Democrats</u>, <u>POLITICO Magazine</u>, <u>Hillarycare</u></p>`)

              <p><small>Students brought change to their campus following an uptick in racial injustice over the summer, and President Glenn Beck emerged as an unlikely ally in their fight</small></p><p><small>August 27, 2016, 12:55 PM EDT / Updated August 27, 2016, 2:53 PM EDT</small></p><p>Students at Princeton University saw success after they had protested for the removal of former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's name from the university's prestigious School of Public and International Affairs due to his “racist thinking and policies.” Student activists also occupied the university president's office last year demanding the change be made, where Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber <span style="color:lightblue;">agreed that the president was racist</span>, but also argued contributions that he made should be weighed in equal measure.</p><p>Wilson was president of Princeton from 1902 to 1910 and served as New Jersey's governor from 1911 to 1913. Though a progressive, Wilson also supported the Lost Cause of the Confederacy and segregation, including appointing Cabinet members who segregated federal departments. About 30 Black and white students, from a group called the Black Justice League, took part in the protest, demanding a range of changes to improve the social and academic experience of Black Princeton students, including the removal of Wilson's name from the campus.</p><p>A review board ruled in favor of removing Wilson's name, alongside a host of other changes that were passed in acknowledgement of the students' demands, but an unexpected voice was there on behalf of the students the entire time, that of President Glenn Beck.</p><p><span style="color:lightblue;">Writing an official statement prior to the review board's decision Tuesday</span>, Beck said “the administration backs wholeheartedly efforts by the student populace to remove President Wilson's name from the campus premises,” adding, “we urge Princeton University trustees to consider recognizing the voices of students of color and to take measures necessary to push for real change. Avoiding discussion of the president's policies, he was a vicious racist, and as the administration to succeed Wilson 100 years to the date, we urge progress be made in rectifying this.”</p><p>The statement of support should come as no surprise, as the president has had a long history denouncing Wilson, though mainly in relation to policies he implemented that would enlarge the federal government. Indeed, the Federalist Society also gave their two cents, commending the students for their work in removing Wilson's presence from Princeton: “<span style="color:lightblue;">Asking a private school to stop honoring an authoritarian hatemonger who also happened to be one of the most destructive presidents in the history of the United States is about the sanest thing we've heard happening on a college campus in a long time.</span>”</p><p>Though he might have political reasons in siding with the students, many on the conservative side of the aisle have noticed the president adopting what some have called a new leaf when it comes to social issues. His recent appearance at CPAC earlier this year had to end about a half-hour before it could properly finish after Beck began to advocate in favor of Black Lives Matter, urging conservatives to “see things from their perspective,” which garnered <span style="color:lightblue;">a chorus of boos in response</span>.</p><p>Though Beck has walked back his comments since, saying he “doesn't support them because they're a divisive, anti-Israel organization,” the view that the president has fallen far short of expectations when it came to what a new, bold brand of conservatism should look like continues to plague him. Elected in a shock after Jon Huntsman and Republicans in Congress agreed to cut a deal and propel Beck and Haley to the White House, it had been anticipated the transaction of power would fall in hardline conservatives' favor, but the president's low favorabilities suggest otherwise.</p><p>Beck has found it quite difficult retaining alliances or advantages in the world of Washington since; whether it be his ongoing feud with The Drudge Report or anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, <span style="color:lightblue;">who the president accused of being an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood</span>, or an inability to transfer some of that moderate appeal over with Haley, who is still licking her wounds after <span style="color:lightblue;">her interview with Matt Lauer last year</span> where she said the Confederate flag had been “hijacked” in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting, Beck is no stranger to the many perils the presidency brings. All the more reason, as has been suggested, that Beck has held true to his one-term pledge, though he claims that was always a personal, and not a political, decision.</p>`)

              <p>Published Jul 12, 2013</p><p>By Howard Bates; Yussef Faasil<br><br><span style="color:darkblue;">KEY POINTS</span></p><p>• <u>Fire in New York City has created headaches for administration in wake of single-day sales tax decrease</u></p><p>• <u>Owners of supermarket victim to fire under active investigation by authorities</u></p><p>• <u>Mitt Romney addresses nation in aftermath of fiery incident</u></p><p>The controversial 'National Day of Mega Sales' as heavily pushed by the Romney White House and Republican House experienced the worst publicity possible early yesterday, after a supermarket located in Midtown Manhattan, Norton-Hyatt, fell victim to a raging fire. Early estimates are already pinning it as the worst non-wildfire in American history. The death toll is floating above the 300 mark, according to sources with knowledge of processes involving the search for survivors and victims' remains in the aftermath of such incidents.</p><p>Reportedly, a grease fire was sparked in a fast food outlet located in the food court area of the supermarket's shopping center. Discovered roughly two minutes after it initially started, orders to evacuate came out immediately. However, there existed limited space to safely and orderly leave the market from, with only two, one located in the front and another specifically marked as a fire exit placed near the rear of the mall, being made available.</p><p>It is being alleged that supermarket owners, father and son duo Isaiah and Wyatt Williams, had told store management to keep the doors closed via the store's electronic security system after being informed of the evacuation, fearing thievery of goods. After around four minutes of delay, the security personnel abandoned their posts and the doors were once again opened. The Williams have denied such, and affirmed the security system had experienced a system failure as a result of the fire, as well as a miscommunication between them and their store management having had occurred, allowing for a stall in the evacuation process.</p><p>Promoted in the wake of President Romney's failed effort to push tax reform through the divided houses of Congress, the single-day event was cooked up by administration officials and economic experts from several fiscally conservative think tanks in a legally dubious move. Romney held doubts, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>but according to reporting by <i>Politico</i></span></u>, he was convinced by Treasury Secretary Mike Leavitt, who lobbied hard on behalf of it, plus a legal counsel meeting with law experts from the Heritage Foundation suggesting the measure was in the grey area, and wouldn't necessarily constitute an abuse of presidential powers. Signing an executive order to get the ball rolling, Romney made it conditional for states to receive funding for infrastructure loans, a package passed by the split Congress, to lower their sales tax, if they had one, to an average of 0% for a day. As Romney rationalized, “the temporary tax alteration will help serve to demonstrate the positives of a newer system to the individual governments of tax-burdened states.” He further suggested it would help accrue data for later pilot programs, and benefits would be experienced overtime for just the one-time decrease alone in consumer activity.</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta “went there,” according to outlets, asking Romney if his administration's push to promote a single-day, national 'mega sale' to build public sentiment in favor of a sales tax reduction might've served as a catalyst for the fire, further calling it a “gimmick” in his inquiry to the president. The line of questioning prompted an emotional response from Romney: “The assertion that our administration's incentives for a one-day sale to generate some economic rejuvenation might've caused this is repugnant,” Romney responded. “I'm going to — I'm — I'm requesting a retraction from your outlet on that. I take great offense to that, and I don't appreciate the assertion. You should be ashamed for having asked that question. CNN owes an apology to the families for using their loved ones' deaths as a political tool.”</p><p>The president has been experiencing several emotional outbursts as of late, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>as first reported by <i>The Washington Post</i></span></u> last month. Though keeping his public appearances of vulnerability mostly concealed, he has, if anonymous sources are to be believed, cried at every closed-door meeting since January.</p><p>“It's a tragedy all around,” Jim Weissman, the lawyer retained by the Williamses, told media outlets. “We're all dealing with the ramifications of it and the damage created. My clients are working closely with the FDNY and cooperating with investigators. No further comment at this time.”</p><p><span style="color:gold;">MORE LIKE THIS STORY</span></p><p>• <u>U.S. credit rating downgraded ahead of shutdown talks</u></p><p>• <u>NASDAQ takes dip; Tesla, Take-Two up</u></p><p>• <u>Fed Chairman Glenn Hubbard to make announcement on interest rates</u></p>`)

The extension was named the Ann Romney MS Survivors Rights Package, named for the First Lady, who was present for the proceedings, and who has had multiple sclerosis since the late 1990s. The First Lady spoke during the ceremony, thanking the president, before she publicly embraced her spouse for the many press and cameras present.</p><p>Romney's move is the first extension to his new healthcare program, colloquially referred to as Romneycare, which passed through the Republican Congress with ease following his landslide win against Democratic opponent, incumbent President Barack Obama, in 2012. The healthcare reform is a change of pace when taking into account President Obama's conceptualization of healthcare, which Romney routinely attacked on the campaign trail.</p><p>All of which is not to say Romneycare does not have opponents of its own, rather the president's right flank have derided it as '<u>RINOcare</u>,' claiming the initiative is as unfriendly to private healthcare providers and businesses as they say Obama's was. Romney, who made efforts to reach out to his many critics on the conservative side during the campaign, has actually taken a different tune as of late. According to a <u>recent report by <i>Politico</i></u>, the president hasn't met with the House Freedom Caucus in nine months, and has even taken efforts to court moderate Democrat voices present in the national legislature.</p><p>Just recently, the president was spotted departing from a private meeting with Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin and Senator Mark Warner at Mastro's Steakhouse in Washington.

              <p>Published September 23, 2015</p><p>President Cheney assured the public he would remain firm on his pledge to serve a single term in office, despite renewed calls from within his party for the incumbent to seek reelection. His recent 49% approval rating is a shocking turnaround from around the time the former vice president ascended to the highest office in the land, in January 2013, where he stood at a record low 22% during his first week in office, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>according to a USA Today/Morning Consult poll of likely voters</u></span>.</p><p>His first year, too, was complicated by the president's frequent clashes with the Democratic Senate and a House far narrower than Republicans managed to acquire following the 2010 midterms. Much of his agenda, including tax cuts and an attempt to reverse President Barack Obama's healthcare reform, failed to gain traction and only resulted in harming the president's reputation in the eyes of the general public. His negative reputation would soon prompt an announcement by the president that he would not seek a second term, a decision heavily speculated to have been encouraged by Vice President Steele, alongside the Republican National Committee, in fear he'd be dead in the water come 2016 and would only negatively impact the party downballot.</p><p>Despite it all, similar to his former boss, President George W. Bush, the Republican managed to make lemonade out of lemons when his administration, on March 8, 2014, shot down a hijacked airline with a course aiming towards the major metropolitan city of Beijing, China. That flight, Malaysian Flight 370, was reported by American intelligence agencies to have been piloted by a radicalized and mentally unwell pilot, with aims to commit a terrorist attack on the Chinese people who were located where the flight was destined to land.</p><p>“It was a tragic day,” Cheney recalled in a one-on-one interview with CBS Sunday Morning's Ted Koppel, “but action had to be taken, to protect the men and women of China, and secure America's place as defender of the world against enemies, foreign and domestic, a reputation we had lost under the watch of my predecessor.”</p><p>President Xi Jinping was reportedly “taken off guard” by the incident, addressing the event by confirming Chinese authorities had registered none of the same suspicious activity the United States had reportedly recorded. Instead, Xi had suggested the only activity it did register was the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>the American vessel which took down the aforementioned flight</u></span>, that had, according to Xi, “trespassed on Chinese territory without any prior authorization or permission,” and “appeared to be locking target on a nearby Chinese aircraft carrier,” located within the same proximity as the airplane.</p><p>The president was dismissive of the Chinese head of state's skepticism in his recent interview. “If we had intentions to strike a Chinese military vessel, we would've succeeded. But we didn't. The aircraft carrier's presence was entirely coincidental.” Asked by Koppel why the United States, just so recently after Cheney seemingly <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>implied military intervention to ensure Taiwan's independence would be authorized</u></span> during a meeting in the East Room, would go out of their way to protect China from an unrelated threat, Cheney was adamant it was out of altruism. “We had the pilot on our watch for a long time, Ted. His private flight simulator in his home, we detected threats present in the software suggesting plans by him to strike in America, and China, and other countries. The Central Intelligence Agency has released the documents for public view, it's all there. So when we had the opportunity to protect them, we took it. We only ask other countries to...not necessarily do the same, since they may make mistakes we wouldn't. Instead, trust us to make the right one, everytime.”</p><p>Xi has remained defiant, however. “China does not accept the United States's narrative, and we will continue to decry their aggressive expansion into Chinese waters.”</p><p>Regardless of the international dispute, the American public firmly remain behind the president. Polls suggest if Cheney were to go back on his promise and seek a second term, he'd enter with a respectable 3-point lead over Democratic frontrunner and former vice president Joe Biden. By no means a large or definitive start, but leagues better than where he was expected to be placed only two years prior.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span style="color:red;">More on CNN</span></p><p><span style="color:lightblue;"><u>White House apologizes for selling 'Jet Fuel Can't Melt Cheney/Steele Beams' t-shirts on website</u></span></p><p><span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Dick Gephardt for Speaker?

His surrender of conservative principles at the behest of the leftist mob? I don't know, what I do know is I can't wait to get to the end of President Gingrich.</p><p>It was bad enough, we all said, when Barack Obama was president. Never before was a man in the position of the Executive Office so brazen in his bid for socialistic dominance over the American landscape with his implementation of the disaster known as Obamacare, or in his generally incompetent handling of the economy. Jaws practically dropped when he let Lehman go kibbutz, but it wasn't surprising when he gave General Motors a life perserver. I mean, would Obama, a natural coward, who let Osama bin Laden off the hook, be the one to stand to the thuggish unions? Preposterous. If my good friend Steven Crowder, whose a pretty big guy and does MMA stuff on the side all the time, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>could get assaulted a few years ago by these same Jimmy Hoffa-acolytes</u></span>, they'd tear a gangly guy built on a diet of arugula like Obama apart. So none of that was ever a surprise. Hopes for him were never high.</p><p>So, with all that in mind, it was something of a do-over for America when Newt Gingrich was elected to be his successor.</p><p>Sure, he wasn't my first choice, but anything was better than Obama for four more years, I truly think this country wouldn't have survived it. It all started well, too. The Gingrich administration's first venture, a wide-ranging tax cut on capital gains and the death tax, was something we were badly in need of to stimulate the economic growth of a country desperate for one. It was looking like Gingrich could've been our Ronald Reagan.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>We really should've been clued in on it sooner. Recall back in 1983, Gingrich, just a backbencher, a particularly loud and vocal one, would rail on the Reagan administration while it was working just fine, and on the most ridiculous of pretenses: “Really, Reaganomics has failed. We must regroup. The national government is running amuck. Without a freeze, I don’t see breakout out of higher and higher deficits.”</p><p>Avoiding for the moment the urge to correct Gingrich's blatantly wrong and misguided criticism, this should've been our warning sign. Gingrich only began to jump on the train to promote Reagan's legacy when it became politically opportune, even stretching to the nineties you'd get him railing on him. He never had foresight, he was always a clout chaser conservative. The man volunteered for Nelson Rockefeller in 1968, I mean really, this is on us.</p><p>Keep this in mind when reflecting on the past four years. What have conservatives conserved under President Gingrich? Outside of moderate successes in the first quarter of his term, the moment Ferguson hit, Gingrich went turncoat. The so-called architect of the Republican Revolution, although I now choose to believe he stole that credit from Dick Armey and just slapped his name on the Contract with America for fame, became an advocate for affirmative action. He formed a money pit known as the Inclusivity and Diversity Affairs department by Executive Order, chaired by Obama-era crony and Gingrich best pal, Van Jones. The cowardice was on full display. And, needless to say, this department did absolute bumpkis, but it got worse.</p><p>In some foolish endeavor of misguided political triangulation, Gingrich decided to pull a Clinton, and sold his soul to the environmental lobby when he passed that horrid abomination known as the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Act. A carbon tax? Limits on carbon emissions? I'm sorry. I forgot we elected Howard Dean as president in 2012, because Gingrich broke out his tie-dye and threw out his dignity with that move. Don't blame Santorum for jumping ship this year (on the topic of the vice president, was Mike DeWine really the only replacement Gingrich could find? He may as well have picked Steve Gunderson or dug up Sonny Bono's bones).</p><p>Hop over to 2015, Gingrich is presiding over a meeting to, get this, “deregulate the automotive industry.” Okay. Sounds good, right? Maybe he'll redeem himself and prevent future Democrats like Obama bailing out unionized hiveminds like GM in the future. No. That isn't what he does. Instead he says there could be found a “middle-ground” (never a good sign when a Republican is saying this), and insists he's found the solution. He had hopes to rein in spending for highway funds, fearing it may deplete the transportation department's allocated funds. That's not an entirely unfounded concern, government is bloated. I'd prefer cuts made to useless social programs funding moms with six kids whose income is derived from the unemployment office, but at least Gingrich is beginning to think like a fiscal conservative. It could pose a risk to Gingrich's plans for a balanced budget come 2018, too (good luck with that, by the way).</p><p>So what does he do? Gingrich...says he wants to crack road width in urban areas down from 10 feet to 5 feet, and begin a 20-year development plan to phase out the Interstate Highway System, to be replaced by, hyperloops. This is our conservative champion, ladies and gentlemen. The solution is not helping promote public transit (<span style="color:lightblue;"><u>another patented Gingrich pivot, might I add</u></span>), it's to build more roads. We should be expanding freeways. I'm preaching to deaf ears here, I'm aware. At the very least, he said the hyperloops would be constructed through private companies, so there's that.</p><p>Anyway, now we're in 2016: the Ghostbusters are women, college campuses are a breeding ground for PC culture gone mad, and Gingrich's poll numbers are in the toilet.</p><p>This man can kiss the White House goodbye, guaranteed, come November, and we will have him to thank when President Hillary Clinton throws us in the meat grinder. With her myriad of scandals, this should be a layup, and it is a layup, for any Republican but Newt Gingrich. That's too high a bar for him, who can only excel in letting conservatives down.</p><p><b>READ MORE STORIES ABOUT</b></p><p><span style="color:blue;">2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION/NEWT GINGRICH/HILLARY CLINTON/BARACK OBAMA/FERGUSON/VAN JONES/CLIMATE HOAX</span></p><p><br><center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EAZIh3H.png></center><br></p>`)

He identified it to have been the result of SpaceX's rocket, coined the Blue Dragon, and announced his intent to direct Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto to launch an investigation into Musk and SpaceX for their involvement in the situation.</p><p>10:35am: <b>Reception of the news</b> has been something of a sight to see:</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OFkk6XP.png><br></p><p></p><p><center><i>The Onion</i> pokes a bit of fun</center></p><p>10:56am: The <b>White House announcement</b> is breathtaking on a number of levels.</p><p>Kerry's call to action further intensifies what has been an extremely poor year for the embattled businessman and former CEO of PayPal. Previously, Musk had attempted and failed to purchase Snapchat. The attempt to acquire the large social media platform failed when it was blocked in federal court due to Musk's purchasing of stock in parent company Snap Inc. prior to the deal. He also suffered a spectacle of a divorce from actress and wife of six years, Amber Heard, which resulted in large sums of money being lost in the following court proceedings.</p><p>Aside from Musk's personal troubles, it came as a shock due to the thus far ambivalent stance the Kerry administration has taken on space programs, which were former president Newt Gingrich's bread and butter. Kerry even suggested on the campaign trail in 2016 when facing Gingrich he might rollback several initiatives that had been taken by the Republican, but walked it back after polling showed it to be one of the few truly popular moves that had been undertaken by his then opponent.</p><p>With Aether II's destruction, many observers are taking it to mean Kerry is demonstrating a firm stance in support of the United States's bid to maintain their mission to colonize the Moon, which had been set to begin by 2023 next year (delayed from 2020).</p><p>11:09am: Several members of Congress from both parties announced their <b>support for launching an immediate investigation</b> into the affair and how such a mistake in SpaceX's Blue Dragon's coordinates and programming would've allowed such a situation to envelop; this was an especially pressing concern as Musk's SpaceX received several large contributions in loans from the federal government during the Obama administration, before President Newt Gingrich would cease such rollouts following his inauguration in 2013.</p><p>Senators Mehmet Oz (R-NJ) and Jason Kander (D-MO) announced plans to create a Senate subcommittee to further look into the circumstances behind the incident.</p><p><center>My and @JasonKander offices are in close cooperation seeking explanations behind this potential case of gross misuse of federal funds that may have helped destroy extremely sensitive and vital government property</center></p><p>— Senator Dr. Mehmet Oz (@DrOz) June 15, 2022</p><p>Former president Newt Gingrich, who launched the groundwork for a renewed interest in space exploration in 2014 when he made funding for NASA a large component of budget allocation, was “furious and distraught” according to sources.</p><p><center><span style="color:lightblue;">Here's Newt</span>:</center></p><p><center>“I support President Kerry in taking every means necessary to uncover SpaceX's role in Aether II's destruction. I further urge the Justice Department subpoena Mr. Musk and other high-ranking officials at the company to uncover the full extent to which their incompetence could allow for such a tragic circumstance to befall our nation. I had read Musk's denial of such malpractice being the cause, I cannot in good conscious believe him. The techno-futurist baloney was not enough to excuse the elimination of millions in taxpayer resources due to his private interests in space exploration, when we had made it clear under my administration such pursuits would be a government-regulated endeavor. I hope for a swift decision to be made.”</center></p><p>Gingrich further blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for “having a hand in the creation of an environment that promoted private space companies over supporting NASA in their mission.” President Obama had yet to comment. It may have been 'memory-holed' now, but recall the conservative backlash of 2015 towards the Gingrich White House's policies, with particular regard to concentrating on efforts to prioritize NASA over private competition in the realm of interstellar expeditions. The infamous “American Judas” CPAC speech by Senator Rand Paul directed at the then-president was a large component that drove his unsuccessful primary challenge. We can only imagine Gingrich feels something of vindication now, if only a bit.</p><p>12:13pm: Former president Barack Obama finally <b>spoke up on the situation</b>, taking to Twitter to announce his support for President Kerry's action and calling for Congress to further follow in his footsteps.</p><p><center>PIC: Obama statement on SpaceX disaster and Republicans say <span style="color:blue;">#ThanksObama twitter.com/kfile/stat…</span></center></p><p><quote>— Andrew Kaczynski (@KFILE) June 15, 2022</center></p><p>12:43pm: Thanks everyone for <b>participating in the live chat</b>.

Attending in recognition of a recent breakthrough in aerodynamics discovered by student Maulik Patel, who was receiving a 5,000 dollar grant as part of the administration's Interstellar Innovation Program, Santorum was supposed to simply hand the medallion and ceremonial giant check to Patel. Instead, Santorum cracked the medal in half, revealing it to be made of chocolate, before taking to the microphone. “I'm sick of this charade,” he said, “I didn't become a Republican Party politician so I could be the spokesman for NASA. I've counted, there've been 140,962 women that've been forced into back alley, coat-hanger abortions since me and the president have taken office due to our administration shutting down access to abortion, who we may also confirm have been rendered completely infertile due to complications that resulted from such procedures. That's simply not enough.”</p><p>President Newt Gingrich addressed the critiques made by his number two hours later after being asked for comment by reporters. “In the instance where the party platform conflicts with my ability to self-aggrandize and indulge in my own legend, I frankly don't give a shit.” Gingrich has, according to <i>The Onion</i> Geppetto index, changed his position on the legality of abortion five-hundred and ninety-two times in just the last six weeks alone. Gingrich has maintained a comparatively consistent message on positions pertaining to other issues, such as a ban on all bidets in the United States for being “too European” and barring State Secretary John Bolton from appearing on television anymore. The partnership between him and Santorum has worsened over time, however. He previously suggested he'd swap out Santorum with everyone ranging from actress Sarah Silverman to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. “I'll take anyone willing to remain in my shadow,” Gingrich said. “I just don't trust monogamists. If you can't multitask in your personal life I can't expect you to be able to do the same in the workplace.”</p><p>Santorum has said his plans for the future remain up in the air. He said he may pose a primary challenge to the president in 2016 or alternatively found a cultist community in the far backwoods of Idaho that'll hunt down and kill horny teenagers that may be camping and engaging in premarital copulation in similar fashion to villains of low-budget slasher flicks. “I don't like to tie myself down, I'm keeping my options open.”</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Y0Rhrbb.png><br></p><p>- <u>Former President Obama Volunteers Himself to Coal Country Democrats For Ritualistic Flogging In Campaign Ads</u></p><p>- <u>Republicans Upset Republican President Is Passing Republican Policies That Remind People They Hate Republicans</u></p><p>- <u>Tom Harkin Requesting Secret Service Protection After Waking Up To Find Pig Testicles Left By Joni Ernst In His Bed</u></p>`)

The American embassy has released a statement claiming the president “wasn't given the proper context” beforehand about the notorious hate group he was speaking to. In his speech, Arpaio made much work whinging over his failed domestic bid to construct a moat across the border between the U.S. and Mexico, which had been denied funding by the American legislature.</p><p>The domestic and international condemnation was swift and furious. Prince Charles was reported as having “flown into a ballistic rage” when he received word of the president's visit just an hour after having shook his hand, whereas Prince Harry went so far as to try and coax journalists present to delete photographs taken of him standing with Mr. Arpaio.</p><p>Arpaio continued to deny knowledge of the group's extremist and racist belief system to media outlets, Press Secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the denial to reporters later earlier today and stated someone would be sacked for the cock-up. The BBC reports that the president, at one point, made mention that he had “the reputation of being the biggest racist in the United States,” to which the EDL members in attendance clapped and cheered in response. A confused Arpaio would question afterward, “what are you clapping for? That I am or that I'm not? Well, I'm not.” He proceeded to exit the stage and take photos with Tommy Robinson, the hate group's founder and leader who decided to continue his work with them in 2013, even suggesting in a speech during Arpaio's visit that seeing him defeat former U.S. President Barack Obama was “encouraging” and was a catalyst that persuaded him to continue his efforts.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/91louBb.png><br></p><p>Arpaio was to meet with Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and even tried to after meeting with Robinson, but the entire affair was subsequently cancelled, with U.S. officials even outright ejected from 10 Downing Street once the news hit. Mass protests in the heart of London over Arpaio's visit had already been transpiring, but grew much more intense once the Robinson meeting became widely circulated news. The U.S. Congress, led by members of the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, did issue a follow-up statement apologising for the misconduct of their president: “We hold nothing but anger at the president's decision to give credence to extremists and racists, and call on him to apologise justly.” Arpaio said he “had no clue who [he] was speaking to” and suggested because of that he “wasn't entitled to apologise.”</p><p>The issue is becoming a minor controversy abroad, adding another row to the beleaguered campaign of Arpaio's vice president, Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Jindal, unlike his boss, would apologise, saying the administration “abhors hate and neo-Nazism.” Similar sentiments were expressed by White House officials, including infamous archconservative Pat Buchanan and previously recalled politician Russell Pearce, who both denied knowledge of Robinson's reputation.</p><p>Worst news couldn't be less welcome for the president, as Mr. Arpaio is hot off a recent impeachment vote, with a vote in the lower legislative body of the U.S. House clearing the bar easily on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, but which fell well short of such a vote succeeding in the chamber's upper house, the U.S. Senate. The Cabinet of the president has rejected calls to issue the 25th amendment, too, which would remove Arpaio from the post of president, replacing him with Mr. Jindal. U.S. Vice President Bobby Jindal affirmed he “stands by the president” when questioned by reporters, though stressed he was “[his] own man.”</p><p>Arpaio announced in early 2014 he would not seek reelection, claiming to have accomplished all he set out to do when he first ran in 2012. Jindal is due to face U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of the state of Vermont in the American presidential election this upcoming November. Jindal has avoided fully embracing his endorsement from Arpaio, who at present moment holds a 23% approval rating, a slight increase from this time last year.</p>`)

Leonard Hidecker/The New York Times</small></p><p><b>By <u>Martin Brady</u></b></p><p>Jul. 27, 2014</p><p>Controversy persists over President Joe Arpaio's authorization for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE to “conduct wide-scale immigration sweeps” over major metropolitan cities following his latest one on Baltimore, Maryland, the ninth one this year. An immigration sweep, as it's colloquially called, involves federal authorities descending on an area, in this case an entire city, to quickly inspect and detain those suspected of violating immigration laws.</p><p>Arpaio has defended the measures as “necessary in the fight against illegal migration.” Yet his administration has had several of their ventures halted and in some cases overruled by the courts through challenges filed by defendants of those subject to the new laws.</p><p>Greyhound Lines is already facing a lawsuit filed by Washington state for allowing ICE agents to conduct warrantless searches against passengers who were detained, arrested or deported after the agents boarded them. Officials in the administration have rejected <u>calls by those including Democrats in the House and Senate, and civil rights organizations like that of the ACLU and NYCLU, that the policies violate the rights of those subject to searches</u>, citing sanctuary city laws in cities like Los Angeles and New York City that have prevented local officers from being deputized as federal immigration agents.</p><p>While such a defense hasn't necessarily been rejected outright, the main point of criticism is directed at the targets of the sweeps themselves, which have predominately targeted minority communities located in the cities, with a recent sweep <u>alleged to have exclusively singled out the Caribbean Americans in the Park Heights and Pimlico neighborhoods of Baltimore</u> last month. Escalating rhetoric from the White House has also been found to have had the effect of arousing and encouraging white supremacists and other hate groups to form their own paramilitary vigilante gangs that have been found to regularly patrol select areas heavily populated by minorities that are mentioned in the weekly press briefings sent out by the administration, which have called such areas “lacking in resources and local government attention when it comes to migrant hordes,” further recommending “the involvement of those afflicted to take action in spite of potential resistance by pro-illegal authorities.” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he plans to work to pass legislation that'd aim to crackdown on this recent uptick of hate and violence, though it's unlikely to pass due to the Republican-held House and Arpaio's veto power serving as roadblocks, both of which have denied the veracity of such claims as “exaggerations” and “distractions.” That hasn't stopped it from becoming a major rallying point for those running in local congressional House seats and in statewide races in this year's upcoming midterms, however.</p><p><b><span style="color:lightblue;">A Guide to the Arpaio White House</span></b><br>Confused about the inquiries and legal cases involving President Joe Arpaio and his allies?

Democrats in Congress are working towards eliminating the executive office's powers in cases of criminal contempt, and with that preventing future cases of presidents being able to pardon themselves in the future. <u>Here's how that has progressed since his controversial move</u>.</center></p><p>Though the tactic is one similarly experienced from Arpaio's tenure as sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, prior to his election to president in 2012, the mastermind behind the nationwide campaign to increase the pressure on immigration and border security is none other than Pat Buchanan. The notorious firebrand conservative had been promoted to serving close to Arpaio's ear on recommendation by Steve Bannon, chairman of <i>Breitbart News</i>, <u>though they claimed to have never even met</u>. The promotion wasn't without controversy, as several Senate Republicans, including John McCain and Rob Portman, criticized his placement. Consideration to appoint him to the position of Homeland Security secretary was nixed due to the slim odds of success facing Buchanan had his name been put forward.</p><p>Buchanan, <u>writing in a recent op-ed for Fox News</u>, suggested further efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration will become necessary and the sweeps on cities are only “a temporary solution for a long-term problem.” He suggested the implementation of a two-year freeze on new immigration and legislation to officiate English as the national language for the United States as the next steps needed to be taken for the country to “begin the healing process,” as he previously suggested in his 2011 book <i>Suicide of a Superpower</i>.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fsY0NrN.jpeg><br></p><p><small>President Arpaio addressing members of the press in 2013.

Buchanan has been quoted as saying, “we're keeping a good pace, though we've got to better accustom ourselves to the problem of trade,” referencing his disagreement with Arpaio on the fight over NAFTA, which the president has yet to commit to tackling. “At the end of the day, if we only engage in empty calorie populism, this will all be for naught the next time a Democrat or a Republican who subscribes to globalist ideology gets elected.”</p><p>See more on: <u>Joe Arpaio</u>, <u>Pat Buchanan</u>, <u>Immigration</u>, <u>2014 U.S. Elections</u></p>`)

              <p>By <span style="color:lightblue;">JAMES BUFORD</span> | jbuford@nydailynews.com | New York Daily News</p><p>UPDATED: December 16, 2013 at 6:42 p.m.</p><p>President David Petraeus was gifted an unexpected surprise while delivering a eulogy for former South African president Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Tuesday.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the late civil rights icon and first president of South Africa, the former apartheid state where Afrikaners held dominance and subjected the native population to routine discrimination, Petraeus had hoped for proceedings to transpire without incident. Unfortunately for the scandal-plagued incumbent, that would not be the case. Three minutes into his eulogy for the late head of state, a woman in business attire would be seen marching through the audience. Security briefly blocked her from proceeding, until she flashed what appeared to be a form of identification, and was given permission to continue.</p><p>Heading to the main stage where Petraeus was speaking, she interrupted his speech and said something inaudible, not captured by the president's microphone but what was reported by onlookers and those nearby as having been: “President Petraeus, you've been served.”</p><p>Petraeus bent down to retrieve the folder from the individual, visibly confused over the commotion and ability of the person to have been able to bypass Secret Service. Giving the contents a glance, the president's face grew angry as his eyebrows raised and a frown emerged, which he quickly covered up with a cough as he pocketed the contents of the folder into his suit jacket and continued with the eulogy.</p><p>It would later be revealed by sources that the folder contained Petraeus's divorce papers, and he had just been served in a public setting. His former, now estranged wife, Holly, denied request for comment by reporters. The White House has similarly refused to acknowledge the incident, now gathering millions of views on the internet through circulated clips on YouTube, with Press Secretary Sheri Annis declining to answer several questions regarding it. Vice President John Kasich did, however, let it slip during a recent visit to Niagara Falls in New York yesterday evening that “those things aren't just random, they're planned. I'd like to hope that wasn't the case.” Kasich didn't elaborate further.</p><p>Congressional Republicans are furious, with Utah Senator Orrin Hatch promising to subpoena Secret Service director Julia Pierson and hearings to be held over what they're calling a “breach of security and betrayal of public trust.” Congressional Democrats have remained tight-lipped, though a staffer for Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland would be privately admonished for tweeting about the incident accompanied by a laughing emoji, according to reporting by the <i>New York Post</i>.</p><p>The president has been embroiled in controversy since the Obama DOJ had leaked the information behind his affair with military intelligence officer Julia Broadwell last year. Despite the hit to his personal favorability, the Republican managed to reverse course and stage a stunning comeback, where he unseated Obama the November of that same year. However, drama over Petraeus's marriage status has remained, with Holly Petraeus confirming her intention to split from the president shortly after he was inaugurated earlier this year. Criminal proceedings over Petraeus having allegedly shared classified information with Broadwell has also been ongoing, though isn't expected to result in a felony conviction of the president.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hTKoGPh.png><br></p>`)

              <p>A very presidential interview.</p><p><small>BY <u>PETE HANSON</u> | Updated: Jun 12, 2021 1:50 pm | Posted: Jun 12, 2021 6:41 pm</small></p><p>A first for us, we managed to scoop an interview with inarguably our most consequential and important interviewee in company history. Yes, you read the title right, President David Petraeus sat with us over the internet for the exclusively-online E3 this year to exchange words on his role in the newest addition to Activision's blockbuster franchise, Call of Duty: Advanced Black Ops.</p><p>We kept the discussion strictly to the game (when possible) and avoided politics, asking how Activision got the leader (well, former) of the free world involved with the franchise, which keen players will remember would be the second instance of Petraeus appearing in such a format, and what he hopes it will help do for the American and international audience that'll be engaging with it.</p><p><i>The interview below has been edited for length and clarity</i>.</p><p><b>IGN: Tell us about your role in the game – will you be portraying yourself?</b></p><p>David Petraeus: Well, I am. I'm playing myself as the president, which I was prior to this past January, of course. I am familiar with the game, in the knowledge sense. I don't play video games. I just know prior to the 2012 election I was included in the game they had around that time and it was in the headlines when I was looking at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Probably would've been embarrassing for the both of us had I lost seeing my inclusion in the game, also I was apparently the Commander of the United States Central Command as I was until I threw my hat in the ring, so the game was actually out of date already by that point.</p><p><b>IGN: What was the process like behind capturing your performance? Were you nervous at all? Did they film you remotely or in-studio?</b></p><p>David Petraeus: I was actually in the studio, it was shortly after I left Washington for my vice president, former vice president, I should say now, and his inauguration. I was bouncing between the folks at Activision's place and recording stuff for some other thing I forget at the moment. So, when I had gotten there, they said I could either a) just record my lines or b) record my lines and get all dressed in this diving suit looking thing with these, a lot of white balls attached to them. They said it's to record the movements for the game. So I said, why not, give me the diving suit, and I recorded my voice and movements.</p><p><b>IGN: Can you tell us your scene or what you'll be doing in the game?</b></p><p>David Petraeus: I'll try and keep it brief, I don't know how much they want me saying. But I'm playing myself and it's revolving around our nation's own deployment into Venezuela in 2017, when we fought to protect the Venezuelan people from Maduro. It's only around a couple scenes, but I give briefings and such regarding our purpose being there similar to what I did at the time. I felt it a good opportunity to expand upon the history behind all of that and further provide education into that subject area.</p><p><b>IGN: Were there any conditions placed on Activision for you to provide your involvement?</b></p><p>David Petraeus: Yes, of course. I mean, the developers behind it had sought resources from our country's armed forces so they themselves have their own restrictions when it comes to stuff like that. It's the same case with movies and when they do the same thing, it didn't reflect much of my own demands because by the time my involvement rolled around that was all approved and I just saw the script. The script was fine to me, I also had my people give a look at it and it was good. I just wanted it to accurately demonstrate our purpose and intentions when it came to that.</p><p><b>IGN: Can we expect further appearances from President David Petraeus in future installments? You're already something of a recurring character.</b></p><p>David Petraeus: I don't know about that. The first time wasn't with my involvement, keep in mind. Someone else provided the voice for that, too. This is probably just a one-time thing from my end, but, as you know, our occupation of Venezuela is still ongoing. So perhaps a sequel, if it may be in order, could use my help. I'd be happy to get involved if they reach out.</p><p><span style="color:red;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p><i>Pete Hanson is IGN's Executive Editor of News.

              <p>October 19, 2015</p><p>By Todd McGuinness</p><p>Findings by multiple independent arms-tracking organizations, based on a year of meticulous documentation of weapons recorded and detailed on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria, have revealed that a significant portion of the Islamic State’s (ISIS) arsenal originated from the U.S. military.</p><p>These research groups have come to a series of shocking conclusions, detailed in the report, which compiles a long list of weaponry that was once owned by the U.S. military but has now ended up in the hands of ISIS and its affiliates. This American-made arsenal includes thousands of rifles (M4 Carbines and M16 rifles), sniper rifles (.50 caliber), grenade launchers (Mk 19), machine guns (M2 Browning), mortars (M29), shoulder-fired rockets (Mk 153), artillery (M119 Howitzer), anti-tank missiles (Javelin), night vision goggles, cargo trucks, Humvees, pickup trucks, armored bulldozers, MRAP mine-resistant vehicles, Armored Personnel Carriers (M577), and main battle tanks (M60A3 Patton). The report also notes that several different air defense systems and pieces of rocket artillery have been identified in the ISIS arsenal.</p><p>“This is an extremely shocking discovery,” said Dan Schorr, one of the report’s researchers. “Most of these weapons could have only passed through a few hands between the United States and ISIS.” The report further details that much of this highly sophisticated weaponry was likely captured by ISIS during the Battle of Damascus from the forces of the Syrian Democratic Front.</p><p>The Pentagon has yet to respond fully to the accusation that its arms program, 'Operation Birch Juniper,' which was initially founded to assist anti-Assad Syrian groups in overthrowing the dictator and later to assist them in defeating ISIS, has inadvertently supplied American-built weaponry to the group.</p><p>President Petraeus has not wavered in his commitment to support the overthrow of ISIS and has recently considered several options to escalate the United States' role in defeating the group.

    e.pages.push(`<h3>President Bachmann and adopted son create stir | <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> | Politics</h3>
              <p>The White House is embroiled in controversy following President Michele Bachmann's decision to adopt 31-year-old British far-right political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos last month. Yiannopoulos, born and raised in the town of Chatham in England, had been residing in the United States on an O-1 visa and reportedly fostered a friendship with the president following a meeting orchestrated by staffers in her administration. <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>According to sources</u></span>, the adoption had been pitched by Bachmann when Yiannopoulos began speaking of his complicated parental situation and, as Reuters reports it, “offhandedly mentioned he was a homosexual.” Bachmann, reportedly, gasped and began caressing his cheek, saying, “you poor thing.”</p><p>Following the authentication of the adoption following months of legal issues being settled, it had further been confirmed, this time by <i>The New York Times</i>, that the president had planned a private 'baptismal ceremony' for Yiannopoulos. Bachmann denied allegation she was partaking in the practice of gay conversion therapy with her newly adopted son, instead insisting it had been Yiannopoulos's idea.</p><p>Yiannopoulos addressed reporters, saying he's “engaged in acts that had been taught to me by authoritative figures in my life” when he was younger, who he further claimed consisted of “radical Social Justice Warriors and feminists.” The baptism held for Yiannopoulos sparked intense discussion over the message the president was sending, with several Democratic politicians claiming it to have been blurring the lines between the separation of church and state, with others more bluntly called Bachmann a “bigot” for orchestrating the event at all.</p><p>Bachmann denied such allegations, instead releasing a statement through the press secretary that she “was partaking in a private affair” that didn't relate to her government duties. The baptism was not filmed, however it was captured by White House photographers who have yet to make them public. The photos have been requested for public release under FOIA laws by several media organizations following the event, which Bachmann claims would “make the situation one made public by the mainstream media” and free her of any claims that suggest otherwise. Though, she reiterated her belief that the premise of separation of church and state was “a myth propagated by those who wish to eliminate Christian voices from our government” (this is not true, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does indeed outline a separation of church and state when it comes to what laws may be enacted by Congress).</p><p>The president also intends to have her new son join her in speaking to CPAC, a gathering of prominent conservative voices and politicians that meet on a yearly basis. Yiannopoulos will speak to the attendees and, according to sources familiar, make his and his mother's opposition to same-sex marriage a core focus, with Bachmann hoping to lead a repeal of <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i> sometime in her second term. How she intends to do so is currently unknown.</p><p><span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Sources suggest she will showcase her policy successes that were achieved during her first term</u></span>, most prominently her push for the mandatory chemical castration of registered sex offenders. The law has overridden state restrictions on the practice for those that may have previously forbid or didn't have any prior law regarding it on their books. Controversy persists as the ACLU continues its lawsuit over the legislation, with representatives for the legal nonprofit arguing it violates the Eighth Amendment regarding “cruel and unusual punishment.” Though her rivals in the Democratic primary have thus far all failed to state their position on the issue, Bachmann has repeatedly mentioned it, and those close to the administration say it'll be a key component of her reelection platform.</p><p>The tactic is speculated to be of a similar manner to that of the Republican strategy employed during the 2014 midterms, where the party, in light of their shock success in unseating incumbent President Barack Obama two years previously, felt “emboldened” to take on much stronger positions on social issues. Though it varied in success (of particular memorability was the South Dakota Senate election where Republican nominee Kristi Noem <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>accused her opponent, incumbent Democratic Senator Tim Johnson, of being a “groomer” for not opposing gender affirmation care</u></span>; she managed to scrape by with a 2-point win), it didn't see the drastic losses some pundits had anticipated heading into it. Instead, the Republicans picked up multiple Senate seats, mainly those of states that typically vote red at the federal level, including Arkansas and Louisiana.</p><p>Following her attendance at CPAC, the president will travel abroad to Israel, where she plans to meet one-on-one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discuss issues regarding the growing threat of Islamic extremist groups present within the region.</p><p>Read more:</p><p><center>- <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Imprisoned Pvt.

              <p><center><small>In a new book, Frederick Keating details the process behind the overhaul of the East Room into a layout of 5x5 cubicles</small></center></p><p><center>By Jock Little</center></p><p><center>Photography by Julia Kendrick</center></p><p><center><small>September 1, 2016</small></center></p><p>One of Michael Bloomberg's more audacious and peculiar proposals during his 2012 campaign for president revolved around the suggestion of transforming the East Room of the White House into what he described as an “office plan” where members of his Cabinet's staff would come together in an open and inclusive space. It's not always the president expresses plans to fundamentally transform the way 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue itself looks and operates beyond how First Ladies choose to decorate the building around the holidays. Jimmy Carter would attempt to bring in solar panels that would subsequently be removed by his successor, Ronald Reagan. In this instance, the successor of Bloomberg's, whether it may come this year or 2020, is going to find much more difficulty in doing away with the changes he's brought to their residence from before he arrived.</p><p>In a new book by <i>AD100</i> designer Frederick Keating, the refurbishment and redesign of the East Room into Bloomberg's vision is meticulously detailed. <i>All Business: The Extraordinary Story Behind the Bloomberg White House</i> (<u>Simon & Schuster</u>, <u>September 1</u>) is a complete and comprehensive guide behind the 15$ million undertaking to transform it into a bureaucrat's sanctuary. Open cubicles, workers diligently moving across the room from multiple desks at a time, and a president at the heart of it all seeking to hear from each and every employee about what they're thinking and working on at any given moment of time. It all traces back to Bloomberg's time at his eponymous Bloomberg LP, the financial data and information company the president founded all the way back in 1981.</p><p>“I'm transforming this place, fundamentally, into one of work and dedication,” says Bloomberg, quoted in the book, lifted from memos and other material he'd correspond with to Keating and others involved in the renovation process. “Digital correspondence is not going to help us, we need to increase the rate of face-to-face interactions. As president, I need to be there and overseeing just what my guys in the administration are doing. All the time. I know from experience back in New York that an open office plan is going to do exactly that.”</p><p>As such, the first thing to transpire was discarding the interior decorations of the East Room left from before he'd kickstart his plans. A few of the material would be donated to the Smithsonian Institution, though most of it would be aunctioned off to wealthy bidders, with proceeds returning back to the federal government. This included Giuseppe Cerachhi's marble bust of George Washington and the gilded grand piano donated by Steinway & Sons back in 1903. This created some controversy, but it was as Bloomberg had wanted it to go, valuing results over reverence of the past, as he described it.</p><p>An infamous complication arrived, following the official launch of the East Room office space in September of 2014, when intruder and Iraq War veteran Omar Gonzalez, suffering from PTSD, ran through the East Room and completely destroyed every piece of equipment present. A quarter of the budget that had been allocated to the project was gone in an instant, and it brought some major egg on the president's face as a result. That wouldn't be too big of an issue for long, however, as through some crafty and shrewd bartering, the equipment destroyed would be replaced by state of the art computer hardware from 1998, Apple iMac G3 desktop computers, installed with the latest version of Windows 98 from that year. “Was it a setback? Certainly,” Bloomberg commented in an interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC the following month, “but there's never been an issue we as Americans cannot overcome.”</p>`)

As far as political satire goes, the episode leaves much to be desired. Christie is portrayed as a ravenously hungry, cartoonishly sadistic bully. There's no real insight offered into his pro-Wall Street policies and how they've affected the country since he took office fourteen long months ago…</p><p>First, the episode's title appears to be a reference to the movie, “The Manchurian Candidate,” with the word “fat” forced in as a weak attempt at a movie reference. It doesn’t really work, especially since there is nothing else in the episode referencing the movie, but I always enjoy it when Family Guy episode titles are allusions to pop culture.</p><p>The episode starts with Peter relishing in Christie's election, since, as Peter puts it, “fat people are moving up in society” (liberal Brian, of course, is particularly upset by the election results, even though he can't help but bark at Obama every time he’s on TV). Peter decides he's entitled to more deference and respect from everyone given fat people's new exalted status. In one of the better scenes of the episode, he takes a baby out of a toddler swing seat at a park, crams himself in the swing seat, and demands the mom push him because “fat people rule the world now.” The seat painfully stretches as Peter stuffs his large body into it, and Peter can barely hide is physical discomfort beneath his self-satisfaction. It's cartoonishly absurd and really hits the mark. Unfortunately, the gags are mostly misses from there.</p><p>Lois and Peter visit the Pewterschmidts, and Peter begins ordering his in-laws' maids around. Peter's behavior in this scene is too childish and cruel to be funny. For example, he orders one maid to bathe him with a sponge under his fat folds, and missing child Madeleine McCann falls out. Not only is this unfunny given the tragedy of McCann's disappearance, but the writers seem to have recycled a prior gag where Stewie falls out of Peter's fat in 'He's Too Sexy for His Fat' (airdate June 27, 2000).</p><p>Carter catches wind that Peter is ordering his maids around and asks Peter what's gotten into him. After Peter (once again) explains that fat people rule the world now that Christie is president, Carter offers to introduce Peter to our nation's obese leader at a fundraiser. Delighted, Peter accepts Carter's invitation. The fundraiser sets up the contrast between Peter and the Griffin family's middle class values and those of the rich who back Christie and his Republican allies. As introduced by Carter Pewterschmidt, the attendees include fictional Wall Street villains of the Great Recession, including “Sub-Prime Mortgage CEO Duke Moneybags” and “Credit Rating Inflator Extraordinaire Max Cash-Steele.” Did the writers think these names would ever get a chuckle out of any viewers? To me, it seems they were under pressure to churn out an episode about Christie, the GOP, and Wall Street's overwhelming support for Christie, but didn’t have their hearts in it and lacked ideas. I did laugh, however, when after introducing Peter to some the attendees, Carter tells Peter that there are “plenty of other fat cats around” and the next shot zooms out to show literal fat cats all over the lavish display of food at the fundraiser.</p><p>Christie arrives at the fundraiser and begins choking after he attempts to eat an entire pig roast in one bite. The episode is full of cheap shots at Christie's weight, which I think distract from the commentary (as shallow as it is) about Christie's pro-Wall Street policies. The show has nothing to say, for example, about Christie's signature “Troubled Asset Stabilization Program,” which was just a belated giveaway of $500 billion to banks. Peter rushes in to perform the Heimlich maneuver, which Peter announces that he learned in a prior career as an EMT (there is a gross-out cutaway gag where as an EMT, Peter performs the Heimlich maneuver on a victim and then saves the forced-out food — chewed up lobster — for dinner). After Peter saves him, President Christie offers Peter a job in the Secret Service as his personal body guard.</p><p>Peter announces to the Griffin family that they're moving to Washington, D.C. for his work as Christie’s body guard. Lois is excited “to become one of those alcoholic, pill-popping D.C. socialites.” I’m not really sure what that was a reference to other than the writers' perception (or the writers' perception of their audiences' perception) that women in D.C. are dependent on alcohol and prescription medication. Peter tells Chris and Meg that he's “sure they'll turn out perfectly fine growing up in D.C. just like all the Republican presidents' kids,” which sets up a cut to a montage of Republican presidents' troubled children (including Reagan daughter Patti Davis, George W. Bush, and his twin daughters). Again, these strike me as below the belt shots at Republicans rather than real, cutting commentary about their policies.</p><p>Brian refuses to move because he can't stand the idea of supporting President Christie in any way. Stewie refuses to move to D.C. without Brian, and surreptitiously stays behind in Quahog (how the Griffins don't notice that their infant is missing is never explained). This begins a side plot about the two getting into trouble while home alone without Peter and Lois. The side plot is clearly based on the film “Risky Business” — the two get in trouble when they hire a call-girl, make a mess of the house, and struggle to put everything back together. I've written this many times before, but this show can't seem to decide whether it is trying to appeal to adults in their forties familiar with 80s pop culture references or adolescent boys. But honestly this side plot is the best part of the episode.</p><p>In D.C., Peter spends enormous amounts of time following Christie around, and the two become buddies. At first, they mostly watch sports and eat fast food together, but Christie reveals himself to be too cruel for Peter to accept.  The turning point in their relationship is when Christie invites Peter to watch a family be evicted from their home by a mortgage company. There is another mean spirited, not-so-funny gag where Christie adds that thinking about foreclosure evictions is the “only way” he can “climax” with his wife, and a fictionalized version of First Lady Mary Pat with very exaggerated, unflattering features enters the scene. Anyway, Peter, whose sense of empathy throughout the show is terribly uneven, feels for the evicted family and begins to question his decision to work as Christie's bodyguard.</p><p>Peter's break with Christie comes when Christie reveals that he is going to replace the country's drinking water with Mountain Dew so everyone can be fat, which would bar anyone from teasing Christie over his weight (and so Christie can get a campaign donation from the owners of Mountain Dew). Peter imagines Lois, Chris, and Stewie drinking gallons of Mountain Dew, becoming morbidly obese, and struggling to breathe (one of the show's funnier gags is when, as part of this sequence, Peter imagines Meg as morbidly obese as part of this sequence and breaking the fourth wall, declares, “I don’t care about her.”). Peter can't bring himself to let Christie follow through on his plan. Peter stops the plan by revealing it to the public delivering a decent speech editorializing about selfishness and greed in politics.</p><p>The Griffins move back to Quahog. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie (almost) get the house back in order just in time for Peter, Lois, Chris, and Meg to get home. The episode ends with a some classic Family Guy dark humor: a dead call-girl falling out of the ceiling onto Meg, seriously injuring her, only for the family to ignore her pain so they can unpack.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this review.

It's a lovely day today in America for those of us who still love it and don't just sit in their corners contemplating the day they can burn it all to the ground. It happens you feel much more fulfilled when you don't bottle your own self-loathing and reflect that back on the country that's given everything to you. Funny that?</p><p>Anyway. Reflecting on some national news, since taking back the House and Senate back in November, Democrats have had a single mission — removing President Christie from office. Today, streams of Democrat politicians in the House introduced articles of impeachment over the so-called Airportgate scandal, and they have the backing of Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>They aren't interested in working with the president you elected, or re-elected by an overwhelming margin, might I add, to solve the nation’s ills. No, they want to score political points to please the radical activists in the Occupy wing of their party. In fact, speaking of which, Speaker Pelosi has only held votes on <i>ten bills</i> since January. That's a quarter of the votes compared to this same period last year. Their agenda is not about serving you. It is about obstruction. Plain and simple.</p><p>So all of this raises the question, what is Airportgate really about, and who is actually responsible for the shutdown of the Detroit airport in January 2016?</p><p>The Democrats want you to believe that this was some harebrained scheme by mid-level aides to the president to force Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, also a Democrat, to endorse President Christie for re-election. They say the airport shutdown during the annual Detroit auto show was designed to sow maximum chaos for the city by diverting visitors during a popular event. And now, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a card-carrying member of the ACLU, a longtime Democrat partisan, and a lesbian activist, has launched a criminal investigation of not only former FAA Administrator Bill Baroni, former FAA Deputy Administrator David Wildstein, and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly — these are the alleged “architects” of Airportgate — but also of Chris Christie himself.</p><p>Of course, an investigation of a sitting president by a state prosecutor is unprecedented, one of just many norms being trampled over in the rush to condemn and remove a popular president from office. As time has proven again and again, in times where the Democratic Party and their acolytes feel their power is being threatened, these talentless partisans in power, our nations' leaders, when they feel they have no alternative recourse than to take what they deem to be rightfully theirs, they will take whatever underhanded methods necessary to do just that.</p><p>But the truth, naturally, lies beyond the Democrats' self-serving narrative. Tonight, we are joined by former United States Attorney General William Barr, a career prosecutor who has valuable insight into Dana Nessel's witch hunt.</p><p>Mr. Barr, thank you for joining us.</p>`)

Evidence of the health problems persisted amid his speeches where the president was found to exhibit several alarming symptoms, including: dysarthria, tremors, and – according to White House personnel – severe headaches that'd prevent the president from working for upwards of 2 hours a day.</p><p>Herman Cain, as vice president, ascended to the office and was subsequently endorsed by Paul, who departed Washington back to his native Texas.</p><p>The claim is the leave was involuntary on Paul's part, and Cain and the Republican Party orchestrated a 'coup' that forced Paul's hand into stepping down. This conspiracy has found a popular base of support from users on Reddit and 4chan, who have both frequently made the claim, with the latter often posting it alongside racist 'memes' of the incumbent president, all of which regularly invoke the belief Cain had a part in Paul's undoing. Even Paul himself has gone on record to suggest as much in the time since he's left office, saying in a recent interview with infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones: “I was thrown out. Herman did me in, really.”</p><p><b><big>The Facts About Paul's Resignation</big></b></p><p>President Paul's term prior to the leave saw him already on ill terms with his party's establishment. His decision to aide in Senator Ted Cruz's efforts to lead a government shutdown in the fall of 2013 saw it stretch into the new year, before his orders were disobeyed and a select handful of Republicans agreed to cooperate with Democrats to reopen it again. This plummeted the president's popularity to a low of 23%, and among Republicans he stood at a fairly poor 67%. Among presidents, their personal approval within their party averages above 70% at a base minimum, with the lowest in recent record being President George W. Bush polling at 57% with Republicans in October 2008, according to Gallup.</p><p>However, that being said, there was never any indication Paul was being forced into leaving, especially by Vice President Herman Cain. In Paul's own words since departing, Cain “was one of the only men there I could trust.” That is not to say there existed no animosity, though, as reports emerged that during debates over drafting tax reform, the two got into it when deliberating tax rates. Paul, according to <i>The New York Times</i>, demanded a total reversal from his 2012 pledge to institute a 0–2–2 proposal, which was seen as a compromise between the two candidates. When Cain heard of this, he allegedly “called the president a 'hick fool.'”</p><p>Regardless, other than disagreements over taxes, the two never seemed particularly antagonistic towards one another otherwise. Where there did exist heated resentment was between Paul and several moderate Republicans in the House and Senate, most prominently Senators John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, Thad Cochran and Speaker John Boehner. Talks frequently collapsed as Paul refused to compromise or back away from his campaign platform; he would go so far as to veto a 30-million dollar aide package meant for the CDC to combat the ebola outbreak in September 2014 after the president unsuccessfully tried to crowbar in an amendment, introduced by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, that would've established a 'public citizen review panel' for grant applications and cut funding for several CDC programs that totaled to 20% of the federal agency's yearly budget.</p><p>It was at this point even Paul was aware of his inability to work with Congress and keep government compatible with his libertarian viewpoints:</p><p><blockquote>“The president was reported as having turned to his son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, before saying, 'we're on borrowed time. I don't see any of this working out.'” – '<u>Inside the Calamity of the Paul Administration</u>' - <i>The New York Times</i>, April 3, 2014</blockquote></p><p>As such, opinion pieces and public statements from conservative and Republican Party figures began to emerge suggesting Paul had to step down for the longterm health of the country and party, as division regularly defined the Paul White House. An impeachment vote was even suggested, albeit in what was at the time described to be a 'joking' manner, by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who further said he “could easily get the vote to rally to a two-thirds majority if needed.”</p><p>Following a bloodbath result where Democrats managed to capture back the Senate and only narrowly failed to clinch the House of Representatives purely due to large-scale, systematic gerrymandering in favor of Republicans, the calls started to really intensify, with Democratic members of Congress also flirting with the possibility. None of this involved Cain's doing, who hadn't voiced displeasure with Paul or his administration, at least publicly.</p><p>The one component that is frequently cited by those in the camp that Cain may have had a hand in Paul's demise is an article by the <i>New York Post</i> in late March 2015, that, quoting an anonymous source from inside the vice president's staff, said “if we needed to, the 25th is the way to go, but we don't think it'll need to come to that.” Cain's office denied the comment came from them and rejected the story, and other media outlets failed to carry it in the aftermath. The <i>New York Post</i> stood by their story, however.</p><p>Due to conflicting claims and a lack of concrete evidence to support the 'coup' charge, we have no choice but to rule it unproven until something much more substantial may come out in the future that can either definitively prove or disprove it outright.</p><p><b><center>Sources</center></b></p><p><center>▼</center></p><p>By Liz Howe</p><p>Elizabeth Howe is a journalist from the Bakersfield area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to local government to national politics.

              <p><small>World</small></p><p>By <b>Rachel Myers</b></p><p><small>September 3, 2013 1:21 PM EDT • Updated 5 hours ago</small></p><p>(Reuters) - Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who had blown the whistle on the mass surveillance of Americans' telephone records, will not undergo criminal proceedings and may return to the United States after having received a presidential pardon by Ron Paul.</p><p>In a decision by the chief executive on Tuesday, Paul cleared Snowden of charges related to leaking classified information, which included three felony counts of conveying such information to an unauthorized party, disclosing communications intelligence information, and theft of government property. Had Paul not pardoned Snowden and he had been found guilty on all counts, Snowden could've served up to ten years in prison for each count separately.</p><p>A Justice Department official confirmed Snowden would not see criminal prosecution following the pardon. Snowden, currently residing in Moscow, has yet to comment on whether he may return or not, but has released a statement over social media thanking the president for “upholding the rights of people over the surveillance state.” Snowden had previously supported Paul in last year's presidential election, donating $250 to his campaign. “After two administrations that devalued the rights of the American citizen, it's a breath of fresh air to have one who truly cares,” Snowden continued.</p><p>Members of Congress, however, have expressed much more negative sentiments over the president's decision. Democratic Senators Ben Nelson and Dianne Feinstein have called the decision by Paul “foolish and inane,” while Republican Senator John McCain said the decision to pardon Snowden may have itself “constituted some form of treason.” The White House has responded to backlash, simply saying, “representatives and Senators have gotten to us over their shock and surprise with regards to President Paul's pardon of American patriot Edward Snowden. We understand it is a shock to them to see a White House that prioritizes freedom over tyranny and individual rights over power. We'll give them all some time to process this, and are urging McCain's handlers to keep his dosage of drugs steady as stressful situations can increase risk of heart palpitations.”</p><p><small>Additional reporting by Jim Crawford; editing by Marilyn T.

              <p>Interview conducted by <u>Graham Mackenzie</u></p><p>August 7, 2014 at 8:32pm</p><p>President Stanley McChrystal's recent initiative to double troop deployment in the Middle East has seen those in the reserves being activated due to lower than preferred numbers among those currently enlisted in active duty. Among those in the ranks, we were able to get an exclusive interview with one member who, in a way similar to how McChrystal once spoke of those higher in rank than him, feels the policies of the administration are reflective of ''the enemy'' (Stanley McChrystal's and our words, not our interviewee's). Here in Kabul, we're eager to get a sense of what it feels like for those with their boots on the ground, especially among those who would've been discriminated in such a position only a few years ago had they chose to openly speak about who they were.</p><p>Wishing to remain anonymous to avoid every comparative point you could draw between <i>Rolling Stone</i> and what we at <i>Queerty</i> are doing, the lieutenant wished to part only a sliver of available information about themselves: they were from the Midwest, they're currently closeted, and they're very displeased with one of the two top members of the current Cabinet (Hint: it isn't McChrystal).</p><p>--------------</p><p>QUEERTY: What would you say is the current climate for non-heteronormative members of the military right now?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: I don't look at my service through that lens predominately. As I see it, my service was one that was reflective of the environment that came about following the events of 9/11. It's a service to my country. Just like that of what my grandfather or great uncle did before me.</p><p>QUEERTY: You mentioned before we started the interview you were a homosexual but chose to keep that private, even in your everyday life. Why is it you continue to remain in the closet over your sexuality?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: It's a personal decision. Nobody here even knows, I don't tell anyone. You're the only one really clued in.</p><p>QUEERTY: Of course, we'd just like to know your reasoning.</p><p>LIEUTENANT: Well, the current environment is more friendly than it was around a decade or so ago, no doubt. We've got DADT repealed, so I could do it if I really wanted to right now, but I'd hesitate to say it's to the point that you can call it a safe decision. It comes with great risks, for me, where I'm from, which I'm going to remain vague on, it's one of the less tolerable areas on my region. But with that said, I'd think about it in the near future. I think coming out could aide in others who find themselves in a similar position that I'm in right now.</p><p>QUEERTY: You say that, do you hold a prominent position?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: I'm going to stop you there.</p><p>QUEERTY: Fair enough. When it comes to Stanley McChrystal, what are your thoughts on him?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: I hold great respect for the president, even though I'm a member of the opposite party affiliation. I can't stand his second-in-command, though.</p><p>QUEERTY: Vice President Perry?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: Yeah.</p><p>QUEERTY: Could you go into greater detail on that?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: Well, Perry's social views are about the crux of why I can't identify with Republicans. With Stanley, I don't think he's a Republican, he may even be a Democrat really, that doesn't escape anyone, not least of which the Republicans right now. So, in that respect, I wish he'd just drop him or switch. Go all out. The rest of his Cabinet isn't half-bad. I greatly appreciate the selection of Mike Mullen and James Stavridis, who are heading State and Defense right now. Those folks speak to me as common-sense choices who reflect who McChrystal actually is.</p><p>QUEERTY: But even in that instance, doesn't Perry's selection at all reflect McChrystal? He had every choice to pick someone else.</p><p>LIEUTENANT: Right. I don't really fault him for that, it's mainly party politics at work. I'm going to assume he'd have selected someone less strict in their views like he is had he been able to avoid that.</p><p>QUEERTY: So you hold no disagreements with his current operation otherwise?</p><p>LIEUTENANT: No, absolutely not. In fact, it's why I stand by my belief McChrystal has some sense about him. His decision to increase our numbers here in Afghanistan is a wise decision. The Taliban at the moment are reeling exactly because of his decision-making. I loved Obama, I volunteered for him even, but I'm on the fence if you ask me whether we'd be seeing the progress we're making under him that we are right now. The Taliban just recently tried to storm the Serena Hotel, we were able to stop them in their tracks. If we were instead seeking to retreat right now, to do the opposite of what we are doing, and were gradually depleting resources, I don't think that would've went as well as it did.</p><p>QUEERTY: Very positive words.</p><p>LIEUTENANT: Well, don't go quoting me now.

This year his work has come under scrutiny because while his models show McChrystal the favorite in the race, he is less bullish on his chances than other forecasters.</p><p>“You'd rather be in the president's shoes than Rick Perry, but it's not an incredibly safe position,” Silver said.</p><p>The reason McChrystal's polling lead, though more sturdy than Obama's was four years ago, may be in doubt, is that the race is closer in some swing states, especially in the Midwest. That means that if he loses only one big state forecast for him, he loses the White House, Silver said.</p><p>The other issue is that McChrystal's base is difficult to determine, having switched parties from Republican to Democratic in early 2015, leading to a chaotic latter half of his term featuring the president going out of his way to repair burnt bridges. Following a nationwide apology tour with Barack Obama, the very man he beat for president in 2012, and other bigwigs involved with the Democratic Party, he's all but completely bled his support with Republicans, who've since fled en masse. When you have a situation as uncommon as that, Silver said, that leaves many questions as to whether McChrystal can effectively corral Democrats to stick with him into the general election, all the while his former vice president, now general election opponent, runs a scorched earth campaign.</p><p>“McChrystal commanded a very formidable performance in 2012, a modern electoral landslide, over 350 electoral votes,” he said. “But now he's totally threw whatever coalition he had then into the air and is trying to run something completely different four years later. It's very difficult to ascertain the likelihood he comes out of this intact.”</p><p>The McChrystal-Flynn ticket is currently ahead of the Perry-Giuliani one by 3 points in Silver's model. A 3 point lead is not safe enough in Silver's model, even if he still gives McChrystal a two-thirds chance of retaining the White House.</p><p>The <i>FiveThirtyEight</i> editor-in-chief defended his projection model from critics who say it should take into account early-voting data.</p><p>“I would be a little bit careful,” he warned of those numbers. “Republicans in 2014 told themselves a lot of stories about how they would be saved by the early vote and fell short of expectations in the midterm [congressional elections]. I wouldn't count out the odds that the tables have turned now, I mean the president's party certainly has, after all, but, we'll certainly see.”</p>`)

An alternative version that had been brought by McChrystal would've broadened the scope of the national service beyond that of the armed forces, like AmeriCorps, however it received extensive reworks after Republicans in the House gained access to the legislation, <span style="color:red;">led by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor</span>, which increased the emphasis on the “strength” within the bill.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of legislative messes for the president, between bungled debt negotiations and reports of tension developing between him and Republicans in the legislature. One meeting reportedly culminated in the president storming out and shouting repeatedly that “[they were] never on [his] side” in policy discussions, resulting in a months-long period where Vice President Rick Perry had been delegated the task of handling discussions revolving around the crafting of legislation as McChrystal focused predominately on foreign affairs, according to our reporting from the time.</p><p>But even that stalemate is quickly crumbling, if anonymous leaks are to be believed. <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Politico</i> have each reported on McChrystal's growing distrust of his second-in-command, with claims that the president fears he was “misled” when he had selected him during the 2012 presidential campaign, where an alleged agreement existed that would have Perry avoid involvement in administrative duties. Now the White House is at a boiling point.</p><p>Though this is the perspective from nearly every accredited journalistic source, the administration tells another story. Press Secretary Ben Domenech painted a much brighter picture at the latest press conference from earlier today, following the failed vote, characterizing the leaks of disfunction concerning the administration as a “smear job” propagated by political opponents. An event is scheduled in the near future where the president and vice president plan to meet in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and, as sources from inside the White House claim, “make-up” in the aftermath of the firestorm.

              <p><small>OCTOBER 9, 2015 • 1:21 PM EST</small></p><p>By Phil Johnson</p><p>For the entirety of Jon Huntsman's time as president, and even before, he has been at odds with the right-wing of the Republican party. Glenn Beck galvanized conservatives in 2012, and, as explored in Don Gonyea's recent book, <i>Fracture: The Schism Within the Republican Party</i>, mobilized conservative resistance to Huntsman to much fanfare. However, after rising star on the Republican right Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who managed to win the 2015 CPAC straw poll over the incumbent Huntsman, declined to participate in the 2016 primary, along with Jim DeMint of South Carolina, social conservatives are turning to firebrand representative and native son to the Hawkeye State, Steve King, who has recently flirted with possibly launching a renegade bid that'll challenge Huntsman for the nomination.</p><p>Huntsman has predominately focused his efforts on emphasizing his moderation and foreign policy achievements throughout his tenure in D.C., although his presidential campaign has taken a notable shift following King's rumored entry. His campaign material has regularly touted Huntsman's fiscal record, both as president and during his time as governor of Utah, in far frequent occurrences in recent months, as well as his efforts to promote monetary responsibility in Washington. Of most consequence, Huntsman's successful brokering of a deal to minimize spending increases while also avoiding a government shutdown back in 2013. Though, this has in recent years become a point of contention that the president may have “sold out” his principles, at least, if comments by Cruz and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama are anything to go by.</p><p>Some reporters, such as our own Richard Conner, have speculated that Rep. King is to test the waters of discontent with Huntsman within the Republican base, possibly paving the road for a stronger conservative challenger. His odds are long, so long it is already being mocked as doomed to fail by some on Capitol Hill, especially among allies to the president like Senators Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake, who've openly talked down such furor that has been bubbling in the GOP. There exists speculation, too, that King may just skip the primary race altogether in acknowledgement of his chances, and take his discontent to the general in a bid to succeed Beck's 2012 run as an independent candidate. Whether the congressman pulls the trigger or not is still unconfirmed, but he'll need to decide soon, as window to become an eligible candidate for the Republican nomination will close by the end of the month.</p><p>Neither the Jon Huntsman's campaign nor the congressional office of Steve King could be reached for comment.</p><p><b>RELATED STORIES</b></p><p><u>In a Crowded Contest, Sherrod Brown Continues to Lead the Pack as Frontrunner</u></p><p><u>Ohio Senator Rob Portman Affirms “Unequivocal Support” For President</u></p><p><u>North Carolina's Pat McCrory Takes Swing at Huntsman, Expresses Hope for “Ruckus” in Primary</u></p><p><u>President Huntsman's Free Trade Program Continues to See Dip in Popularity: CNN Poll</u></p>`)

              <p><b>By Associated Press</b></p><p>Jan. 17, 2014 10:50 PM PT</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Jon Huntsman is facing renewed inquiries over his family business, the Huntsman Corporation, and their ties to the People's Republic of China following the president's decision to <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>cut capital gains taxes for businesses with investments in China</u></span>, but excluding Iran, Syria and Venezuela from any benefits. The move was included in the latest, 900-page tax reform legislation Huntsman helped oversee and pass alongside Speaker John Boehner and a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Senate a month prior. This has incited the wrath of some in Washington, even from his own party, over concerns that the president may have misled Congress into giving the Huntsman clan a bonus.</p><p>“The president has very serious questions to answer for,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, “the Huntsman Corporation was already one of suspect for pollution charges and outsourcing of labor in the past. Now we're seeing what could very well be a conflict of interest.” Following the report, the Democratic minority in Congress pledged to form committee hearings and investigations into the Huntsman Corp. and its ties to China if they were to win back the majority come 2014. Due to extensive gerrymandering, not to mention the president's relative popularity, the odds of that are very long.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VzppQCE.png><br></p><p><small>FILE - In this Jul. 19, 2013, file photo, Pres.

Barack Obama over their growing interest in its western neighbors. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)</small></p><p>The president continued to deny the charges being brought against him, saying he has “always recused [himself] from situations involving Huntsman Corp. and [his] political career, be it as governor of Utah or as president of the United States.” He further suggested the move to cut the capital gains tax was emblematic of the free trade platform he had originally promised to enact while running for president in 2012: “None of this is any different from anything I said back then, when I was a candidate, I was for this, unlike many times a candidate becomes the politician, I didn't back away and I still stuck by that.”</p><p>Along with the Huntsman administration's vision for an expansion of economic opportunity on a global scale, the president is seeking to maintain his own foreign policy doctrine, a blend of the previous presidencies that came before him. Less neoconservative or expressly opportunistic as many critics were quick to label President Barack Obama, the Huntsman agenda is one of relaxed foreign policy although selectively engaged in affairs that are deemed as a “threat” to United States interest if left be. He did indeed support withdrawing from Afghanistan, as many on his right flank were quick to attack him over during his 2012 primary campaign, and now with a President Huntsman, the American presence there has been removed. However, as one source close to the White House has described, “the president is not, contrary to popular thought, opposed to intervention when needed.” That point being ever as clear with regards to his decision to throw down the gauntlet in Syria, as he has <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>authorized limited missile strikes</u></span> on the country without congressional approval for the past several months, which even led to an extinguished impeachment attempt brought against him by U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p>Now with Russia's Vladimir Putin threatening to engage in hostile action over the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, President Huntsman's foreign policy, in both the economic and military sense, is due for something of an update, if insiders in Washington are anyone to believe. Rumors of a planned expansion to include Russia and Belarus alongside Iran, Syria and Venezuela to the exemptions are being floated by prominent Republican politicians and policy advisors, with Treasury Secretary John J. Mack suggesting it “<span style="color:lightblue;"><u>wouldn't be too bad an idea</u></span>” when questioned in New York City last week. Huntsman has kept his cards close to his chest, but if the next few months are as eventful as they're appearing they may be, he might not be able to for much longer.</p>`)

Two years ago, the president formed a committee to investigate Obama's birth certificate, which he had previously claimed was fake. During this investigation, it was found that measures were being taken to deport the former president, after a tape leaked of a conversation between Trump and Attorney General Rudy Giuliani revealing as much:</p><p><blockquote><center>AUDIO TRANSCRIPT:</center></p><p>TRUMP: Rudy. It's a little bit hard to understand you, maybe the reception is coming in bad. But, look, Obama. I want a complete and total shakedown. This needs to end in a deportation. A deportation, Rudy. I want Obama deported. I want you to find me the evidence.</p><p>GIULIANI: Mr. President, I've had the DOJ look through it, I'm not finding anything on it. I can't promise anything on that right now, at least not yet, unless we find something, we can. I'm looking through it all I just don't see it, Donald. I'm going to direct them again and if we can't find anything we might have to drop it altogether.</p><p>TRUMP: Rudy, I'm saying to you, find me the evidence. Find me the real birth certificate. I want to, I want a discovery. I want you to go and discover something. Get me a discovery and I can look into it myself, Rudy, okay?</blockquote></p><p>Two weeks ago, the tape was released to the general public, leading to the House of Representatives to adopt impeachment articles against President Trump. Trump's approval rating has now reached an all-time low, standing at only 34% as of <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Gallup's recent estimations</u></span>. The White House continues to vehemently deny the existence of the tape, with the president himself having called it “fake news” and “doctored” at his most recent press conference yesterday.</p><p>When reached for comment, Obama declined to make a statement, however, former vice president Joe Biden condemned Trump's actions as bigoted, and encouraged the Senate to remove him from office.</p><p>This comes amid a series of recent struggles for Trump, given his reelection bid, in which he is lagging behind presumptive nominee Martin O'Malley. <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>A new Emerson College poll</u></span> showed him behind by nearly 10 points following the impeachment. Despite entering office with an approval rating of 59%, his popularity quickly declined after the economy failed to properly recover, along with his refusal to give more established voices in the Republican Party a say in his administration. Amid a primary challenge from Governor John Kasich of Ohio, Trump has frequently reshuffled his cabinet with much more conservative members in an effort to block out Kasich's appeal. Despite this, however, Kasich has won a sizable portion of delegates, even winning some contests outright such as in the state of Vermont.</p><p>The president is also being investigated for allegations of paying hush money to porn actress Stormy Daniels in 2011, hoping to prevent his campaign from being harmed had it come out during the election. That story was also recently leaked through a tape with Trump and Michael Cohen, in which the president mentioned having done so through a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>The Senate trial is set to be held next week, where, according to multiple anonymous staffers, Trump has a very real chance of being removed from office following confirmation by Arizona's John McCain that he'll vote in favor of it.</p><p>This remains a developing story.</p>`)

But when Donald Trump signs the “Fair Trade for North America” agreement, it, of course, turns out to be a fraud.</p><p>NAFTA is estimated to have cost our country nearly 800,000 jobs in the years since it was signed, and was used by greedy corporations as a way to slash wages by just sending the jobs to Mexico, where there are fewer labor protections than there are in the US. Those are 800,000 people who aren't going to be able to go home and feed their families.</p><p>Despite the Donald's rhetoric on trade back in 2012, and from his bully pulpit as the leader of the free world, he once again found himself beholden to his donors, as seen when he slashed taxes for them and their corporations last year. When discussing the issue on the campaign trail, Trump conveniently seemed to have forgotten to mention the fact that at least as many jobs will be outsourced under this agreement as they ever were under NAFTA.</p><p>The logistics of the deal are, just frankly shocking, as they should be to anyone who's been following the news cycle over the past few months.</p><p>BROOKS: Paul Krugman's pointed out that in many ways, it could end up causing more harm than NAFTA ever did.</p><p>SEDER: Oh, easy. For example, it’s still cheaper for these corporations to outsource their jobs to Mexico, make a car, and send that car back over here. Maybe he thinks those “illegals” will go back to Mexico to go take our jobs, because those jobs aren't here anymore.</p><p>Despite the wishes of the majority of the Democrats in Congress, the deal failed to get any environmental protections passed, and will continue to harm our planet to help the top 1% get their yachts and their golden toilets. The Democrats of this generation, this class, they just don't know anybody who is going to be subject to this stuff. It's ridiculous, and a lot of them voted for this. Barbara Boxer was on MSNBC defending this! This is the kind of thing you get when you elect a billionaire as your president, of course. I would reiterate I was no big fan of Obama, but do you think this would've happened if we just voted for Obama again? I don't think so.</p><p>BROOKS: No.</p><p>SEDER: Yeah. Anyways, in the long run, with the whole investigation thing going on, I'm still a little hopeful Democrats grow a spine and kick him out of the White House before things get worse. With that being said, if there's nothing else to add?</p><p>BROOKS: Looks it.</p><p>SEDER: Alright, so, we'll be back Wednesday, where we'll go over the bailouts.</p>`)

Browns general manager Andrew Berry has been tight-lipped on the buzz, but released a statement saying “I can't comment on the story, but it would be the highest honor to have Madam President grace our team with her leadership, which our country was lucky to have these past eight years.” Berry has been on the search for a new head coach since Kevin Stefanski was unexpectedly terminated early into his contract after a shockingly poor season.</p><p>The White House has been silent on the matter as well, leading many to speculate this is indeed her next stop once she departs Capitol Hill on January 20, 2021.

              <p>OCTOBER 19, 2018 • 3:29 PM EST</p><p>HEARD ON FRESH AIR</p><p>Terry Gross</p><p>Several Republican congressional candidates ahead of this year's midterms are calling for <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Keith Ellison</u></span> over <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>domestic abuse allegations being directed at him</u></span>. As Ellison faces increasing calls to step down over accusations that he physically abused an ex-girlfriend, one prominent conservative is coming to his defense: his colleague, Justice Clarence Thomas.</p><p>Since August, Justice Ellison has been at the epicenter of the greatest crisis to hit a sitting Supreme Court justice since 1969, when Justice Abe Fortas resigned in the midst of an ethics scandal. In August, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>the son of an ex-girlfriend of Ellison's claimed in a Facebook post</u></span> that the Justice had become physically violent with their mother. Justice Ellison has denied all claims made, though the backlash, especially among those on the right, has proven intense. The post has since gone viral, and has been shared by prominent conservative media and legal figures, among them Tucker Carlson and L. Lin Wood.</p><p>Justice Thomas has made himself an odd man out in conservative circles, however, coming to Ellison's defense when speaking at a conference in Philadelphia yesterday, hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal foundation. “He should be given an opportunity to explain himself. He shouldn't just be cannibalized by a media frenzy,” said Thomas. The comments were Justice Thomas's first on the accusations against his colleague, and the first to be made by any of the justices sitting on the Supreme Court regarding the controversy.</p><p>More from NPR:</p><p><center>• <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Survey shows broad opposition to consumption of food products that test positive for high levels of rat feces</u></span></center></p><p><center>• <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Former southwestern Pennsylvania mayor sentenced to life in prison for 2013 shooting of unarmed Black man</u></span></center></p><p><center>• <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Steven Spielberg on adapting Valve video game to the silver screen: 'It's the biggest project of my career'</u></span></center></p><p>The response from the crowd was mixed. Some attendees clapped, others booed — a reaction to the conservative legal icon unlikely to have occurred in any other circumstance. Follow-up speaker Eugene B. Meyer, the president of the Federalist Society, would reportedly say “the best thing about living in a country like the United States is we hold the right to disagree, and when it comes to comments made tonight, I might be enjoying that privilege more than I normally would,” which elicited laughs and cheers, and is thought to have been made in reference to Thomas's remarks.</p><p>Following their August recess, House Republicans leading the Oversight Committee have convened <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>a series of hearings investigating Justice Ellison</u></span>. The Republicans' investigation of Justice Ellison has metastasized to include his finances and speeches. It has grown to become a hot-button issue on the campaign trail ahead of the midterm elections, where vulnerable Democratic incumbents, like Senators Sherrod Brown and Bob Casey, have been made to take a stance on whether or not they'd vote to impeach if it were to come to a vote.</p><p>Since being nominated by President Barack Obama in 2010, Justice Ellison has remained a continuous source of controversy for those on the right. Ellison is the first Muslim to serve on the Supreme Court, or any federal appellate court, a milestone which drew the ire of many conservatives during the his contentious confirmation hearings. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>rather infamously suggested Ellison being of such a faith was “disqualifying”</u></span> in an interview with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly from around that time. Since then, Justice Ellison has kept himself in the headlines, with many of his law clerks having gone on to represent left-wing causes or lightning rod clients, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>such as Guantanamo Bay detainees</u></span>.</p><p>There exists speculation that Justice Thomas's defense of Justice Ellison is borne out of his own experience defending himself against <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>Anita Hill's accusations of sexual misconduct during his confirmation in 1991</u></span>. “He knows what it’s like to be pilloried as a public official. Clarence Thomas understands the agony of that experience,” said former Senator John Danforth, who spearheaded Justice Thomas's confirmation.</p><p>In his new book, <i>Faith and Flag: Keeping the Hope in America Alive</i>, Danforth details his view on the current political landscape — informed by his past as an ordained Episcopalian priest. In the book, he delves into his experience behind the deliberation process that took place during Justice Thomas's hearing, and in our interview with him today, he sees many parallels to Justice Ellison.</p><p><i><b>Editor's note:</b> The interview with Danforth was recorded on Oct. 8.</i></p>`)

Scalia, a staunch conservative, was known to attend the opera with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the most liberal member of the Court, where they'd attend performances of <i>La Traviata</i>. As described in NPR's Nina Totenberg's recently released book, <i>Ruth and I: Tales from the Bench</i>, which reflects of Ginsberg's years of experiences, the two were “happy warriors, playful with each other, maintaining an almost sibling-style banter.” The two even spent every New Year's Eve together.</p><p>But over the past five years, the relationships between the liberal and conservative justices have become so acrimonious that longstanding Supreme Court practices have fallen by the wayside. Most startlingly, for the first time in the Court's history, <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>the justices no longer hold conferences to discuss cases</u></span>. Instead, memos are written by each justice on each case, to be distributed between the justices.</p><p>“There’s really no precedent for the breakdown in the culture and deliberative process of the Court that we’ve seen,” said legal historian David Garrow. “You can trace that change to the appointment of Goodwin Liu. He was bound to clash with Justice Alito.”</p><p>In July 2005, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor unexpectedly announced her retirement from the Supreme Court. While usually siding with her more conservative colleagues, O'Connor proved a crucial swing vote, especially on cases which broached hot button social issues like the right to an abortion. Initially, President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, a trial judge for Washington, D.C.'s federal court, to the seat. But in September of that year, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, opening another seat. Bush decided to withdraw Roberts's nomination for O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to become the next Chief Justice.</p><p>Bush's second choice for O'Connor's seat was White House Counsel Harriet Miers, a longtime political ally of the president. She faced bipartisan opposition over her lack of judicial qualifications, lack of experience deciding issues of constitutional law, and conservative legal groups considered her to be, at best, an ideological gamble. Following the contentious nomination of Miers, who Bush was forced to retract, the nomination fell to Judge Samuel Alito of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Alito was hand picked by Federalist Society founder Leonard Leo. Indeed, he had rock solid conservative credentials, having served in the Department of Justice during the Reagan administration, where he accrued a reputation as a mafia-fighting U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, and most recently as a hard-right judge on a federal appellate court, albeit a less influential one. Alito had also been a member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton, which opposed the college becoming coeducational in the 1970s.</p><p>Long story short, Alito's nomination to replace O'Connor would swap a swing vote for a sure conservative vote.</p><p>Numerous liberal groups opposed Alito’s nomination, including the ACLU — only the third time in the group’s history that it opposed a Supreme Court nominee. During Alito’s confirmation hearings, on January 10, 2006, a thirty-six year old law professor from the University of California, Berkeley sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify against Alito’s confirmation. His name was Goodwin Liu.</p><p>Liu's testimony was mostly milquetoast, quoting statistics and citing judicial opinions by then-Judge Alito to argue that the nominee was outside of the ideological mainstream. <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>But Liu's testimony ended on a fiery note</u></span>:</p><p><blockquote>“Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of resistance; where the FBI may install a camera where you sleep on the promise that they won't turn it on unless an informant is in the room; where a Black man may be sentenced to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man, absent a multiple regression analysis showing discrimination; and where police may search what a warrant permits, and then some. Mr. Chairman, I humbly submit that this is not the America we know. Nor is it the America we aspire to be.”</blockquote></p><p>Despite Liu's polemic conclusion to his testimony, Alito was confirmed to the Supreme Court on January 31, 2006. As fate would have it, just four years later, that same law professor went on to succeed another Italian-American Federalist Society-aligned Supreme Court justice: Antonin Scalia. With a near-supermajority of Democrats in the United States Senate, President Barack Obama had an opportunity to drastically shift the Court’s ideological balance. To affect that, Goodwin Liu's place on the Court was sealed.</p><p>Republicans quickly seized on Liu's testimony against Alito's confirmation during the confirmation process, but to little success.</p><p>That takes us to today, where the animosity on the Court couldn't be more evident. Speaking to a conference, Liu earlier this week made a statement that would be considered verboten in earlier generations. Justice Alito should face an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>“I can't comment either way, it'd be improper of someone in my position to do that,” referencing a recent comment made by Texas Representative Al Green, several comments, in fact, that had the congressman say he'd soon introduce articles of impeachment against Alito for misconduct and ethics violations, pertaining to a recent <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>report by ProPublica that he took several luxury trips with billionaires</u></span> with ties to conservative political PACs. The impeachment effort is expected to fail decisively if introduced and brought to a vote, which is also unlikely. “But,” Liu would add, “if there was ever any speculation of a member of the Court's ability to make decisions on rulings depending on potential ethics conflicts, like what's being alleged right now, I'd of course support that. We can't be held to a lower standard than the judicial processes below us. That's just not right.”</p><p>The comment was taken as an indirect endorsement of Green's move to impeach Justice Alito by several conservative columnists, pundits, and the current Republican administration in Washington. The White House would <span style="color:lightblue;"><u>release a statement</u></span> calling Liu's comments “a deliberate attempt to spark conflict on the bench,” and requested the Justice retract his statement. Neither Liu, Alito, or those close to them have commented on the situation as of the writing of this article.</p>`)

              <p><center>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT</center></p><p><center>No. 12–96.</center></p><p><center>Argued February 27, 2013—Decided June 25, 2013</center></p><p><blockquote>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” <i>South Carolina v. Katzenbach</i>, 383 U.S. 301, 309. Section 2 of the Act, which bans any “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of race or color,” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and is not at issue in this case. Other sections apply only to some parts of the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the “coverage formula,” defining the “covered jurisdictions” as States or political subdivisions that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s. §1973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, §5 of the Act provides that no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. §1973c(a). Such approval is known as “preclearance.” The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized several times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or 1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time. Shortly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to bail out from the Act’s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged the Act’s constitutionality. This Court resolved the challenge on statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Act’s continued constitutionality. See <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder</i>, 557 U.S. 193.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Petitioner Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama, sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington, D. C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against their enforcement. The District Court upheld the Act, finding that the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing §5 and continuing §4(b)’s coverage formula. The D. C. Circuit affirmed. After surveying the evidence in the record, that court accepted Congress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, that §5 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage formula continued to pass constitutional muster. Held: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act remains constitutional because the “exceptional conditions” which justified its enactment in 1965  remain prevalent today.  Although the covered jurisdictions no longer engage in blatant racial discrimination, the Court concludes that more indirect means of voter suppression are prevalent.</p><p>Held: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act remains constitutional because the “exceptional conditions” which justified its enactment in 1965 remain prevalent today.

But recent events have led us to the circumstance we now are in, and after the unfortunate passing of the man, I am here now, addressing y'all tonight, to let you know, America isn't being abandoned. No, nonsense. Far from it. I'm here, and I'm telling you now, we'll get through this.</p><p>Mankind — that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests.

His family I bid only the strongest goodwill and condolences. I have combed through the list of nominees who could possible fill his large shoes, it was a difficult task and not one I took lightly.</p><p>What held the highest importance for me was nominating someone who held a strong and passionate view on federal government to refuse the enlargement of it.

Someone who maintains our liberty and keeps us safe, not through the allowance of unlimited spending or engagement abroad, and of course, I acknowledge this is not a lawmaker I am appointing, that is not the point. Rather, what I am nominating is someone who is an originalist in the mold of Scalia, as the Constitution kept to a strong bond that denounced authoritarianism and brought about fairness and the wealth and liberty of the people without contorting it in a disturbing manner that permits unlimited executive action that we've bore witness to in recent years.</p><p>So, enough of that all in mind, I won't keep y'all waiting on bated breath any longer.

It is not through the blunt hit of a baton nor through the adornment of a badge that those in our country hold power over us, this was not what Washington or Jefferson or the many others who fought for our nation had ever intended.

He has proven to me that he has the necessary knowledge that calls for originalism and the excercise of constitutional thought that dispels the notion of those who've in recent years have attempted to bend it to their own benefit. Polston is not like that, rather, he only aims to keep true to our nation's ideals and belief system.</p><p>Ricky, I'd love for you to come up and say a few words before some of the weenie Republicans in the Congress get nervous we're nominating a real conservative.

For the decades that I've been in Washington, from the start when the country seemed to be losing its way before Ronald Reagan, it seemed as if our nation was on a downward slope.

Scalia was ingenious and never failed to stick to his strong adherence to originalism, not the textualist, pro-bureaucrat twisted way of thinking that deliberately distorts the government and the Constitution. It deliberately refuses to engage with the Constitution and read and interpret the text as it stands. So, in the search for a candidate, I was aiming for, of course, the exact opposite of that.</p><p>Diane Sykes of Wisconsin is someone I firmly believe can excel in continuing where Scalia left off, if her decisions and long track record of conservative legal decisions are anything to go by.

It is in my pursuit to find an applicable replacement I've strived to work with those closest to him to find a candidate who could compare as close as possible to the originalist principles that guided Scalia's view on judicial matters. I believe I have very well found that replacement.</p><p>Though there were many great candidates, all qualified and worthy in their own right, I know in my selection of Justice Thomas Rex Lee from my native Utah we've come across someone Scalia would approve of immensely. Thomas is an intellectual heavyweight.

I have zero doubt in my mind that the capabilities of Thomas are of such great certainty that it came as no question he was the candidate the moment we hovered over his name, and, in a bit of a contradiction from earlier, this one moment does grant me pleasure, because I know it would've brought pleasure to Antonin just as much as it does me.

It is a truly dark day in America, speaking as a fellow Italian-American, to announce the passing of one of the greatest Italian-Americans in not just the history of the Supreme Court but arguably of all American history itself. Justice Antonin Scalia was a great mind, one in many ways similar to me who didn't back down before the mob of leftist anger over upholding the Constitution, being able to read the text as it is defined. He didn't back down before the hate, he stood firm, and for that we thank him duly. I pass my thoughts and prays in this time to his wife and children and grandchildren, their relative was an epic figure in our country's great history. We will remember him always.</p><p>In replacing someone of such iron will as Scalia, I sought someone of the necessary vigor who similarly didn't fail to prove to me they got the guts and strength to tackle the leftist instigators and activists who want the law bent to their own liking, to the benefit of criminals. I cannot stomach that. It was vital to him, thusly, that the candidate proved they were as their predecessor was, an originalist who ruled just as our Founding Fathers would've approved of when they wrote the Constitution itself.</p><p>It brings me great pride and joy to say I have found my man. James Ho, the former Solicitor General of Texas, is my man. He proves the doubters wrong. No, we in this administration do not look down upon immigration, as an immigrant from Taiwan himself, James is one of the good ones. He has proven to me to be one strong on our borders, resilient to the pressure to endanger our fiscally conservative practices, and he's got the balls to do it all without succumbing to the backlash, just like me when I was sheriff in Maricopa County. I see the reflection of me, Scalia, and all of America in James. I know it is only right to get him on the bench immediately so he can take pride of place as the true bulwark that he'll be taking the place of. He will be an excellent Justice, so let's give him a hand.</p><p>Enough from me. James, please get up here and tell them yourself how good of a candidate you are and how much you love America. Let's see the hate from this one.</p><p><span style="color:darkblue;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p><i>Joseph Arpaio, Remarks on the Nomination of James Ho to be a United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Justice Antonin Scalia was a great man in private and in public, and despite what may be said of his decisions by certain critics of his, not entirely unfounded, I'd hesitate to suggest that ever shined a negative light on him. Rather, he held firm to his own belief system that was entirely within reason and respectable. It is not in the place of those like us who didn't have to bear the heavy weight of the impact his decisions would have to cast judgement, instead let us take the opportunity to say thank you for a life well-lived in dedication to his country. For that, we will miss Justice Scalia dearly.</p><p>In selecting a replacement I put heavy emphasis on choosing someone who could help usher in unity, to keep both aisles of the political spectrum in alliance in this contentious time. I believe I have found the candidate who can do just that. Judge Ann Claire Williams is a highly qualified candidate, one who has been appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, to be specific, and was considered for appointment by Republican and Democratic presidents once again, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as it happens. I am assured of this, that this record is remarkable. No candidate I have found was as capable of uniting members of opposing political parties as well as she has, I can assure you all of that.</p><p>Judge Williams will excel on the court. She is not intended to be a political ploy, or a partisan pick, no. She couldn't be further from that. She is simply this, qualified. She is the best candidate on offer, and I welcome the members of the Senate to find that out for themselves. I can help them get started on that right now, by inviting Ms. Williams on stage to say a few words of her own.

As someone who practiced in law, as a fellow Italian-American, native son of the Garden State, the passing of the Justice is a difficult thing to see a great mind leave us so soon. His work interpreting the Constitution was immaculate and just what we needed, he did not define it as many activists wish judges would, they do not politicize the institution, and they do not implement restrictive, regulatory red tape that do not represent what the Founding Fathers had ever intended when they wrote the laws that lay the foundation for this country.</p><p>That all being said, it was instrumental to find a voice who could hold a candle to the late legend. Of course, keeping in mind what I had just said, I do not wish to politicize the institution anymore than I believe it has been in recent years with activist selections and appointments, so it was a challenge to say the least walking a tightrope between my own personal belief system and upholding the rule of law as it is written.</p><p>That brings me to the woman of the hour. Judge Anne Patterson was an appointee of mine back in New Jersey when I served as governor, she was selected as a compromise between me and Speaker Sweeney when it came time to narrow our list of choices. We both agreed, she was not only qualified, but a perfect choice that perfectly embodies what the Supreme Court oughta be looking like. I stand by her wholeheartedly, and I have the full confidence within me the Senate will feel the exact same way, and we'll be getting a hell of a lotta bipartisan votes in her favor.

          <p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kTmgSWr.png><br></p><p><small>Obama White House continues to pledge support for Israel amid conflict</small></p><p>By <u>Jack McRae</u>, CNN</p><p>Updated 12:35 PM EDT, Sun November 3, 2013</p><p><b>Washington (CNN)</b> — President Barack Obama ticked through a multitude of things he wished to see from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: including an increase in humanitarian aide flow directed to Lebanese civilians caught in the crossfire of the conflict and a report on the conditions experienced by current prisoners of war in IDF custody.</p><p><u>A person familiar with the Tuesday call</u> ran down the Netanyahu's responses, characterizing them as “frightened” and “anxious.”</p><p>But Obama wasn't finished. The prime minister had to announce the moves publicly later that evening, the president insisted.</p><p>By Tuesday evening, the Israeli security cabinet had approved those two measures to increase humanitarian aide flow and release an authorized report on conditions of incarcerated individuals held by the IDF.</p><p>The brief exchange over the phone marked the ninth time Obama had threatened Netanyahu with serious consequences since the breakout of war between Iran and Israel transpired nearly a year ago if he did not take serious actions to change the way the nation was handling the war. Obama, who has remained firm on his support for Israel — even amid growing political backlash at home — warned the prime minister that if conditions did not rapidly improve for civilians in the surrounding areas, he would reconsider how the US was backing Israel in the conflict.</p><p>The prime minister's office declined to comment on the phone call. The White House declined to participate in this story.</p><p>In both the official White House readout of the Obama-Netanyahu phone call and public statements following the call, US officials have declined to specify exactly what US policy changes are under consideration.</p><p>Slowing down the US's supply of weapons to Israel would be the most likely policy change, one senior administration official told CNN, <u>pointing to a recently released national security memo</u> that lays out standards foreign governments that receive US military aid must adhere to.</p><p>But that official stressed that no decisions have been made and that the question of how the US supports Israel’s current war is a complicated one. There are other levers that the administration could potentially pull, they said, including those related to military aid writ large or the United Nations, as well as drastically shifting Obama's public rhetoric about his administration's support for the war.</p><p>Criticism has been launched over Obama's handling of the conflict, directed primarily by one of his former opponent's in last year's presidential election, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders has repeatedly decried the “aggression” of Netanyahu in the war, where the death toll continues to climb as it approaches the one million mark. He has said Obama is “being played a fool” and suggested the administration has been leaking stories where Obama feigns an offensive position with the prime minister as part of a public relations campaign to cover for his relative weaknesses. Obama has yet to address or even acknowledge Sanders since he won reelection, and the Senator continues to lack any committee assignments after having been ejected from caucusing with the Democratic Party last January.</p>`)

With the state of the race as of writing, <span style="color:lightblue;">Democrats are on the verge of what will likely prove a humiliating and brutal defeat</span>, one not since 1994, though our estimates have those comparisons looking wildly incomparable in favor of this year being far more gruesome for the Democratic Party.</p><p><i>FiveThirtyEight</i> previously <span style="color:lightblue;">published an article</span> on the flooding of funds into vulnerable Democratic races seven weeks ago now from AIPAC and other interest groups with a deep investment in the ongoing conflict, and nearing the cusp of election eve, we can safely say nothing the Democrats have done since has been able to mitigate the damage it'll likely cause them at the ballot box. In plugging a <span style="color:lightblue;">spreadsheet</span> I built charting the polls across the 435 districts, the House of Representatives is looking close to impossible to win back for Democrats. Rather, by my estimates, a 52 percentage win of the total popular vote would garner 57 percent of all House seats. Right now, Republicans are polling at 58. At a bare minimum.</p><p>Outside of the House, statewide contests in Oregon and New England have strongly affirmed themselves in the Republicans' favor, with Democrat John Kitzhaber collapsing in the weeks since we last looked at his race. Democrats are now either a) seeking to contain the threat by maintaining their strength in relatively safe states (though what applies as a safe state for them at this point is largely a mystery, unless we were to count local races in the District of Columbia), or b) reflexively demonstrating their opposition to the president where they have proven most vulnerable.</p><p>It was a sight to behold when California's Jerry Brown, of all people, <span style="color:lightblue;">mocked Obama for his candor and inability to establish himself as a leader with consistent allegiances</span> at a fundraiser last month. Brown's credentials on determining who is sufficiently consistent aside, he wouldn't prove too big of an exception, however, in fact, his snide remarks were very tame compared to D.O.A. Senator Mark Pryor, who not only went as far as to decline participating in overseeing tornado damage with the president in his state of Arkansas (likely a self-inflicted wound in hindsight), but at his Senatorial debate suggested he “voted for the other option, without regrets” in 2012, implying a vote for Republican Condoleezza Rice. This article is pending an inquiry as to whether Pryor was actually making a pivot to the progressive side and suggesting he harbored love for Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Outside of federal elections, incumbent Republican candidates of such toxicity as to warrant so much as a Likely R rating in the environment we're in are basking in their rebounding odds. Scandal plagued Tom Corbett, the governor of Pennsylvania, has easily surpassed Democrat Tom Wolf in polling and in our forecasts, and is anticipated to be on track for a safe return to Harrisburg come next year. He had prior been out to lose last year, but has seen his numbers triple since.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, despite many persistent rumors and speculation, including I'm not afraid to admit <span style="color:lightblue;">my own at the time</span>, that his 2012 third-party bid would permanently kill his chances of climbing the ladder of success in the Democratic Party he caucuses with, the opposite seems to persistently emerge as the case. Rather, 2016 looks to be open season for the Senator, as he leads over virtually all other prospective contenders, including long-anticipated frontrunner Hillary Clinton and other speculative opponent Joe Biden, who has adamantly refused interest in gunning for the spot. <span style="color:lightblue;">If the polls are anything to go by</span>, that just may very well be for the best. Though never say never, especially in presidential politics.</p><p>Sanders, though having hedged his bets in recent weeks, seems to be the only prominent name still open to floating his name for the gig. He'll have a tough job ahead of him, as with Obama's anchor continuing to drive down downballot Democrats, it may prove a difficult task. Though him challenging the president in 2012 will no doubt aide his case that he is his “own man” as they are oft to say in these cases.</p><p>With that aside, the midterms are, relatively speaking, concluded if not decided before we have even received the first exit poll drop. We have the Republicans' odds of retaining the House at a staggering 99% and their odds of capturing the Senate at a hardly distant 87%.</p>`)

          <p>By Bill Hillman for Fox News</p><p>Published September 4, 2013 2:20pm EDT</p><p>President Condoleezza Rice paid Israel a visit during their war with Iran over the weekend, a conflict which the United States has heavily involved itself in following the loss of Democrat Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. A special ceremonial event was organized in which the president was given the red carpet treatment, touring around Tel Aviv and the city's surrounding areas before performing on the piano for the Israeli Defense Force.</p><p>“The president was honored to have the opportunity to give Israel's troops some joy and comfort in their time of darkness right now,” Press Secretary Ana Navarro told reporters Tuesday. “Anything the United States can do to alleviate their suffering we'd be happy to do.”</p><p>Rice played a piece from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, before transitioning to a rendition of 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' that the soldiers would boost with thunderous claps and the stomping of their boots on the floor of the Charles Bronfman Auditorium where the president played. Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu attended the ceremony, and once Rice was finished, escorted the president to a nearby military outpost. Touring the armaments, Rice took some time to write words of encouragement on the artillery shells present, including 'Finish Them!' on one, which generated <span style="color:lightblue;">some scattered backlash in the United States</span>.</p><p>“The president's actions were tone-deaf,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated, “for the gravity of the situation she should know better than to go and take it to such lows like that.” Other members of the Democratic caucus were much more explicit in their criticisms, with Senators Tim Kaine, Carl Levin and Ron Wyden together issuing a joint statement that the president “needed to stop parading around and answer Congress's questions when it comes to what the foreign aide packages are containing,” in reference to recent legislation passed through Congress that has provided Israel with billions in weapon investments, majorly with large bipartisan support, although defections have continued to increase in the distance since the violence between Israel and Iran first started last year.</p><p>Progress is being steadily made on the side of Israel, although a recent “distraction,” as some critics have coined it, involving an excursion into the Gaza Strip has made it difficult to estimate how long it'll last. Rice's comments at a recent fundraiser has further sparked questions over escalation of American involvement, with possible troop deployments to assist in Israel's wartime effort being routinely urged by Republican politicians. It's even grown to the point Rice is being hit from her own neoconservative flank, what was, and mainly still is, her base of support, over her hesitance to get directly involved. “We elected her on the basis of defending Israel and Christians in the Middle East, we've been caught lacking, we can't pussyfoot on this further,” commented Senator Lindsey Graham in <span style="color:lightblue;">a recent interview with Shepard Smith on Monday</span>, “if we don't start seeing substantial efforts now we're going to pay the consequences, and so will she.”</p>`)

He had previously showered her with gifts totaling 200,000 dollars, and paid for the composition of the song 'African Flower in the White House' in her honor. Gaddafi's mansion in Libya, which had been ransacked a few months ago by rebels, also revealed a library of photos of the former Bush administration official that were previously in his possession.</p><p>FILED UNDER: <small>FUNDRAISING, CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING, CONDOLEEZZA RICE, MUAMMAR GADDAFI</small></p>`)

Now reduced to several satellite entities controlled by a variety of elements and factions, Egypt can hardly even qualify as a functioning country compared to the Egypt of pre-2011, before the Obama regime failed to live up to their responsibilities abroad and allowed the nation to descend into chaos following the Arab Spring.</p><p>The remnants of the Mubarak government have managed to regain some footing in the time since, aided by a new Republican administration in Washington who proved more sympathetic to their necessary existence. Yet, even then, progress is far from where it needs to be for Egypt to return to the stability it saw prosperous results from under their former leader. Before he was brutally murdered on the streets of Cairo, Hosni Mubarak served as the Egyptian president and commanded his people with an iron fist. Making it abundantly clear, his reign was far from respectable, and in every respect was repugnant and deplorable. By every definition available, Egypt under Mubarak was undemocratic and tyrannical.</p><p><span style="color:red;">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER</span></p><p>I once had a colleague in a university who was teaching around the period of this brutal crackdown, and the horror stories told to me were of a brand of vile I need not dare to try and trivialize. Students of his, active in politics, eager to participate, slaughtered by the hundreds and arrested, taken into custody. Futures lost forever, books never to be written of the young, budding minds that once thought of a better world. If it were that perfect world where such dreams could take flight, I'd have no issue in saying that Mubarak deserved only the worst fate for the misdeeds he perpetuated. But we live in ours, and that's not what we can hope to have happen.</p><p>That all said, it's a lesson we should've learned in Iraq when it came to Saddam Hussein's rule, that being, sometimes bad men must hold power if we are to keep society held together. And even in that case, Mubarak was far from Hussein's brand of villainy, not to excuse his police state nor the last, desperate days of his regime, where international audiences saw a crackdown on civil rights and the mass murder of protesting civilians. It justly came as a tough decision to compel Obama to act on behalf of Mubarak in that event. Aiding a dictator would've proved a bad look under any president, not to mention one who made their name as the 'hope and change' candidate, only to be tainted with a stink of economic turmoil and partisan tar-and-feathering. In times like that, it is where presidents truly define themselves, but Obama failed to amount to such lofty expectations.</p><p>As we continue to pay the price for isolationism to lieu of fear and cowardice, we return to the present day. Republicans have announced their plans to redirect more funds towards acting president Ahmed Shafik and what is recognized to be the Egyptian government, with murmurs of further involvement continuing to linger. Whether that may play out or not remains to be seen, though I hold my doubts whether the fatigue experienced from the many other prolonged occupations may ever truly subside in our modern era.</p><p><i>Haisam Yetarian is an adjunct fellow at FDD, where he analyzes Arab-Israel relations.</i></p><p><b>TAGS</b>: <u>Egypt</u>, <u>United States</u>, <u>Barack Obama</u>, <u>Hosni Mubarak</u>, <u>Ahmed Shafik</u></p>`)

          <p><small>Russia’s actions in Crimea are, in many respects, part of an attempt to strengthen its sway over the new government in Kyiv—with the preferred outcome of a federalized Ukraine.</small></p><p><small><b>by Wojciech Konończuk</b></small></p><p><small>Published on March 13, 2014</small></p><p>The Russian military's move into Crimea, together with the ongoing tensions in several large cities in Ukraine's eastern and southern regions, demonstrates that the Ukrainian drama is far from over. It is now beyond dispute that the government established in Kyiv after popular protests drove then president Viktor Yanukovych from power in February 2014 has lost effective control over the largely ethnic-Russian-populated region of Crimea. The territory is under Russia's de facto occupation.</p><p>Russia's unexpected invasion of the Crimean Peninsula is, in many respects, part of a desperate attempt to strengthen its sway over the new government in Kyiv. Moscow's apparent plan to annex Crimea is not an end in itself. Rather, Russia seems to be acting in a more sophisticated way, and it is essential to read the situation right.</p><p>Moscow aims to influence developments in Ukraine by using Crimea and the destabilization it has inspired in the eastern and southern regions to force Kyiv to adopt an entirely new model of governance. Russia's preferred scenario is federalization (or even a confederated republic), which would grant Ukraine's regions—especially those dominated by Russian-speaking Ukrainians and ethnic Russians—far-reaching political and economic autonomy. Russia probably calculates that, thanks to its largely unchallenged influence in Crimea and possibly in other regions, it will be able to obtain effective and long-term leverage over Ukraine's main strategic decisions, including future moves on European integration.</p><p><big><b>Russia's Act of Aggression</b></big></p><p>Despite what Russian <u>President Vladimir Putin</u> said in a recent press conference, Crimea was not seized by a local paramilitary “self-defense” force but rather by a few thousand well-equipped and heavily armed Russian troops. The forces came mainly from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and the North Caucasus, and they had extensive support from the 15,000 soldiers of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.</p><p>The aggression began on February 23 in Sevastopol, the largest and most pro-Russian city on the peninsula, which has been called the most sacred of the sacred places of Russian imperialism. A rally of a few thousand people, organized by the Russian Front, a radical Crimean organization, dismissed the city's mayor and elected a new one, who is reportedly a Russian citizen. The demonstrators demanded that the autonomous republic secede from Ukraine and become part of Russia.</p><p>On February 27, unidentified armed men entered the Crimean parliament, demanding a special session to determine the region's future. Under dubious circumstances and, <u>according to Ukrainian press reports</u>, without a quorum, some of the deputies voted to hold an all-Crimean referendum aimed at “improving the status of autonomy and expanding its powers.” They also dismissed the region’s pro-Kyiv prime minister and voted for a new one, who is a member of a radical, pro-Russian political party, Russian Unity.</p><p>When several hundred unidentified armed people took control of Crimea’s airports, main roads, local government buildings, and other strategic sites on subsequent days, it became clear that these moves had not been organized by local pro-Russian self-defense groups. Existing Crimea-based paramilitary units are simply too weak and too few in number to carry out such actions. Although Putin and other top Russian officials have long maintained that the armed and uniformed personnel without insignia on the peninsula are not Russian troops, it is now well-established that Crimea was the target of a well-executed, Russian-led military operation.</p><p><i>Wojciech Konończuk is the head of the Department for Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova at the Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW) in Warsaw.</i></p><p><small><u>Security</u>, <u>Foreign Policy</u>, <u>Russia</u>, <u>Ukraine</u></small></p><p><small>Carnegie does not take institutional positions on public policy issues; the views represented herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Carnegie, its staff, or its trustees.</small></p>`)

          <p>Analysis by <u>Zachary B. Wolf</u>, CNN</p><p>Updated 3:09 PM EDT, Thu May 30, 2016</p><p>Since the contentious decision by the Republican House, where Speaker John Boehner was strong-armed by the conservatives of his party into skipping over Republican nominee Jon Huntsman for third-party protest candidate, former Fox News host Glenn Beck, the moderates of the Republican Party have developed an agitation over the Electoral College process to a similar degree as their Democratic counterparts. Since the controversial 2000 election, but also dating farther back to around the time of the 1968 election, there has been growing resistance to the process in which the United States elects their leader.</p><p>Activists in the Democratic base, who've amplified their voices since the contingent election, especially in regards to the decision to skip President Barack Obama's vice presidential selection for Nikki Haley, which Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has categorized as a “mistake” ever since, have made it a core point of contention in their primary selection over whether candidates support or oppose the Electoral College. Even among those who have kept to an institutional streak have made it clear their opposition, when not accounting for outliers such as West Virginia's Joe Manchin.</p><p>That much was all expected, however. What may have not been was the Republican response, which has seen a stark divide emerge between those still sore over the conservatives of the party's decision to boost Beck and those who were firmly in the Huntsman camp, now adamant they be repaid for having their candidate “stolen” in the aftermath. “The theft was beyond the pale,” quoted Jonah Goldberg, an editor for the <i>National Review Online</i>, “when you have something like that determining leaders, serious change demands to be made.” Not alone in their criticisms, Republican congresspeople have said as much on the floor of Congress. Senators John McCain and Susan Collins were even rumored to co-sponsor legislation to have been introduced by Democrat Cory Booker last year that'd address it, though the plan seemingly fell through as nothing came of it.</p><p>In the time since, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact has risen in popularity among red states that lean moderate, with Utah and Arizona being among some to join the pact after 2012, with a similar bid getting close but narrowly failing to pass in Kansas once local Tea Party groups rallied in opposition to it in the final stretch. President Glenn Beck has publicly called such opponents “sore losers” and, despite having held an initially cordial relationship with his one-time opponent Jon Huntsman, has since taken to Fox News and other conservative media outlets to mock him. Haley has continued to remain silent on the situation, dodging questions whenever asked since she took office.</p><p>This has had the effect of further hampering the Beck administration's legislative agenda, as efforts to repeal several Obama-era legislative efforts have routinely failed to garner enough votes among the Republican caucuses in Congress. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has attributed this to the “bad feelings” that continue to pervade the party, taking to social media to urge his fellow Republicans to “recognize the real enemy and stop fighting one another.” Huntsman, though remaining a core element of the fighting itself, has instead sought to distance himself from the controversy entirely. “I have nothing to add on the matter, except I hope to see John Kasich bring about substantive change to Washington after he beats the Democrats in November,” referencing presumptive Republican nominee, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and presumptive Democratic nominee, former president Barack Obama.</p>`)

Tbh, the problem is it is safe. Insanely safe. It wants to have its cake and eat it too. Honestly. If it were like the far-left messaging the critics on the right and Fox News are calling it I think I'd have loved it but it wasn't.</p><p>So Columbia has it where its a racist city, okay. So, question. Why did it separate from the US? Last I checked America was racist af in 1912 when the movie and video game takes place, I don't see the issue Comstock is having with America and it's never actually explained well, I never played the video game, but here its a cheap excuse, because Cumbia honestly is tame compared to irl America at that time. That biracial couple at the beginning would've been murdered outright, they wouldn't have a showy gimmicky stage show where Booker is told to throw a baseball at them. Its such cheap performative stuff on the part of the writers. And ofc the rebels are just as bad as the racists because they start burning down the entire city and Booker starts shooting them down because...I really have no idea, I must've blinked my eyes for five seconds cause they jumped through a timeline and here he's a martyr but because plot demands it they go bang bang. Really stupid, hardly the dumbest part of the movie but def the most indicting.</p><p>You'd think with how Whedon got into hot water for calling Black Widow a monster for being infertile he'd change the way he portrayed his female characters but Elizabeth is just a damsel in distress (ofc outside when she kills a parody of a revolutionary in Keke Palmer's character of Daisy Fitzroy, so there's that) but if he'd go and quit Twitter again likely not, he really got saved by all the right-wingers crying about this otherwise he'd be quitting Twitter again for everyone pointing out how outside of Palmer there are ZERO Black main or supporting characters in a story about a white racist dystopia, and including Palmer ZERO Black main or supporting characters who aren't made into antagonists. How he's getting away with that rn idk, you can really get away with a lot when you've got people on your right flank mad at you I guess.</p><p>And WOW that speech he gave to the premiere audience in LA was something. Seriously? This movie is dedicated to Obama and then he connects the setting and reelection being 100 years apart and says the movie is commentary against a country that's still racist because it denied him a second term? Cry me a river. He was a war criminal. I couldn't care less he got knocked out by another criminal, don't destroy Libya next time maybe? idk maybe he said sorry in the latest memoir he's dropped.</p><p>Anyway, Elizabeth and Booker are like cardboard. Terrible characterization, they felt like they were going through the motions and didn't feel like real people at all. Acting all around sucked, Bridges was hamming it up, that twin couple played by Neil Patrick Harris and Kate McKinnon also sucked, annoying. I'll say the set design was awesome at least and action was alright. But otherwise skip it.</p>`)

          <p>Published on Sep 12, 2016</p><p>1,188,972 views</p><p><span style="color:mediumspringgreen;">———————————————————</span><span style="color:red;">—</span></p><p>22k likes | 3.4k dislikes</p><p><strong>CLOSED CAPTIONING TRANSCRIPT</strong></p><p>CODY: Oh, Obama. To many he was the progressive voice snuffed out too soon, to others, he was a radical socialist triumphantly defeated in a modern day Republican revolution. But, say he didn't lose in 2012. Say he narrowly squeaked out a win against Romney despite the long odds of presiding over the economic crisis of 2009, and he was able to keep true to the pledges he was promising in a second term. In a second term where he'd be able to escape the lingering shadow of the banks collapsing and really be able to get what he wanted done.</p><p>Let's rewind a bit. Obama wanted to pass affordable healthcare as his core agenda, and though he needed to get over the bump that the crisis brought at the onset of '09, he was able to pass the public option. In this alternate Obama second term, Obama would be vindicated in the face of the opposition he was receiving. Alternate Obama would doubtlessly seek to pass healthcare that went farther than what he was initially proposing: you already know it, universal healthcare. Obama was a fan of single-payer, he was quoted in a speech delivered in 2003 how he wanted to see it passed, but due to the controversy persisting around the Great Recession, that agenda needed to be neutered to be more palatable. If he had been reelected, Obama would be pushing harder for it much more. Seeing this, under the assumption Republicans keep the House, Republicans led by John Boehner would likely support Obama and help him get it done. They'd see the backlash towards them and support for Obama, and wisely course-correct under the stewardship of Boehner.</p><p>Shortly after Obama lost, a leak was revealed where RNC Chair Reince Priebus planned to commission an autopsy report that would try and understand where they went wrong. It is safe to assume a major component of that report would pinpoint healthcare as a core factor in their messaging. In the very same way we would see in the United Kingdom, where the Conservatives need to compromise with the public on their healthcare system, we'd see that here, and Obama would get the necessary votes to pass his bill.</p><p>Outside of the domestic sphere, let's look at foreign policy. As we saw it, Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea, where the Russian Federation annexed the portion of Ukraine. In this alternate scenario, this wouldn't happen. Obama was friendly with Putin. We even saw him express so at the debate with Mitt Romney where he expressed opposition to Romney's, quote, '80s policy,' reflecting a shift away from the way Reagan and the Republicans handled such affairs. In this timelime, Obama wouldn't push Putin to such measures as President Romney did, where he antagonized them and labeled them a crucial 'geopolitical foe.' This is widely recognized as the catalyst for Putin's actions, where he felt it necessary to go on the offense as the United States began to make overtures against Russia.</p><p>Lastly, we have the rise in civil unrest that occurred in the latter-half of the Romney administration. In our timeline, we did see the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman under Obama, however, that failed to see anything in the same light as what happened following the deaths of Freddie Gray or Michael Brown under Romney. This is likely because Obama was able to more skillfully communicate with disenfranchised minority groups as a Black man. In the Obama was reelected timeline, we'd likely see no riots in Ferguson or Baltimore, as Obama would be able to calm the public and maintain order, unlike Romney, who as a white, aristocratic Republican personified everything the protesters felt was wrong with the system. That's a big reason why when he tried to walk with the protesters they unloaded garbage on him en masse, they would not have unloaded garbage on Obama, probably.</p><p>We will never truly know what an Obama second term might've looked like, but we can make close approximations that might get close to the truth. I am Cody of AlternateHistoryHub.</p>`)

    e.pages.push(`<h3>All Pain, No Gain: Inside The Johnson White House | <i>Politico</i> | Playbook</h3>
              <p>By JONATHAN PRINCE <small>and</small> DREW CARTER</p><p>06/08/2032 12:07 PM EST</p><p>President Dwayne Johnson's flagging reelection campaign is the talk of Capitol Hill according to sources involved and familiar with the day-to-day operations of it. The president's consistent lagging performance in most polls, dour news abroad, and the emerging spectre of economic woes are just a select few of the handicaps impacting him and his party's prospects ahead of November's election. Johnson, once capable and prepared to lead, now often looks fatigued in the occasional public appearance he'll sometimes be able to muster. How did the president, who at one point swaggered with a large and robust approval rating frequently floating in the low 60s, fall to such lows?</p><p>Elected in a shocker during the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election, Johnson's entry was the political equivalent to an earthquake. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, left blindsided by the <i>Fast and Furious</i> star's decision to throw his hat into the ring, may as well have flown a white flag the moment the news broke. Prepared to run a highly-partisan campaign revolving around controversial conservative pundit Larry Elder's candidacy, Newsom instead ran a shambolic and poor operation, unable to defend his fragrant violation of his own state's COVID-19 quarantine protocols quite as well as he might've otherwise, and was overtaken by his opponent's celebrity and charisma.</p><p>“The hierarchy of the California Democratic Party is about to change,” Johnson famously said during his victory speech.</p><p>Strikingly similar to another muscle-bound bodybuilder turned actor turned California governor, Johnson made his loyal allegiance to the reelection of his party's president a core priority leading into 2024. While that election would go quite differently than it did for Arnold Schwarzenegger and George W. Bush in 2004, Johnson's profile was quickly on the rise. Reelected by a comfortable margin, Johnson's management of California was, as one reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> adeptly described it, “politics as usual.” Ever averse to controversy at every turn, Johnson delegated his government to a variety of political science professionals and party elite within the state legislature. Apart from some minor controversies, like allegations that Johnson broke the exact same rules his former opponent had broke during the pandemic before he became governor in 2020 or taking part in the second season of the NBC sitcom <i>Young Rock</i>, based on his own life and centered around the premise of the governor running for president in 2032 (the network and governor were able to work around potential campaign finance law violations due to his scenes having been filmed prior to his gubernatorial bid), he was able to keep and maintain a relatively clean reputation with the general public.</p><p>With an open field for the 2028 Democratic nomination, Johnson virtually steamrolled the competition. Rising above the petty policy debates that the American public have long been uneasy with, he largely ignored establishing concrete positions beyond the simple slogan: 'Humble. Hungry. Get a Hard Worker in Washington.' A simple phrase, but one that effectively sold Johnson as the tough and easy to like candidate that all of America could get behind. The only moment of genuine ferocity during the primary campaign season for the Brahma Bull came when his nearest contender for the nomination, New Jersey Representative Josh Gottheimer, questioned if Johnson truly was “natty.” Following the off-the-cuff remark, Johnson shot a dramatic head turn and a cocked eyebrow at his fellow Democrat, before admonishing him for taking the race to a new low. Though never explicitly denying the accusation, Johnson subsequently shot up in the polls as the enamored party membership signaled their approval of Johnson's friendly and charismatic persona.</p><p>( <span style="color:blue;">Also on POLITICO: Taiwan Strait clean-up continues in aftermath of 'thunder run'</span>)</p><p>Easily sweeping the primary competition, Johnson was able to continue that momentum into the general, skillfully besting Republican nominee J. D. Vance with minimal hardship. Despite entering the White House with plentiful political capital, the president betrayed his namesake as he would effectively resign himself to not rocking the boat, even with the amount of power he had obtained providing him a clear path if he had chose to. When requested by supporters, not to mention the progressive base of his party, to begin pushing for innovations in healthcare, as an example, Johnson was quick to shy away and instead advocate for “a united America.” It was around this point Johnson held the highest approval of his political career, with peaks in the high 60s, even rising into the range of the low 70s. It seemed as if Johnson's decision to pursue nonpartisanship as the core tenant of his administration was a savvy and teflon strategy.</p><p>But not all would remain well, as bad news came with the leak of President Johnson's vulgar comments following a strategic meeting with Hillary R. Clinton, where he was recorded as telling staffers that the former vice president's advice to him was the “biggest piece of dogshit that I've ever heard.” He further asked them why he should be listening to an “election loser” who had “cost Obama his legacy.” After the news caught wind of the remarks, Johnson issued an immediate statement claiming the recording was “a product of artificial intelligence,” which had possibly been manufactured by his political rivals. Once more evidence came out that his comments were genuine, the president issued a follow-up apology, but it would prove too late, as Clinton would respond that she would not be endorsing Johnson during the upcoming primary, creating intense headaches for the Schwarzeneggian chief executive.</p><p>( <span style="color:blue;">Also on POLITICO: Governor Tagovailoa, Miami-Dade County officials sound alarm on experimental energy provider Treer</span>)</p><p>But even among the left-wing of his party, Johnson has repeatedly and consistently sought to delegitimize their influence and actively fought them. When confronted on signing legislation to clear away student debt, as heavily lobbied for by Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Johnson allowed it to die in the transitional period of the late year it had been passed by without so much as lending it a signature nor a veto. Ocasio-Cortez called Johnson a “joke of a party leader” shortly afterward, and Johnson was left to do damage control in repairing the fracturing relations with the progressive bench of his party. But such measures were short-lived, as it was revealed not long after by <i>The New York Times</i> that Johnson had been working behind the scenes to sabotage leftist members of his party in congressional races, planting testimonies from the administration's staff that falsely accused several progressives in Congress of “conspiring with Republicans” in hopes of shutting down the government, and directing party funds to aide centrist candidates' Super PACs, even in cases where the moderate candidates were attempting to primary out incumbents to their left.</p><p>Internal conflict has also remained a frequent fixture of the Dwayne Johnson administration. One recent meeting, centered around diplomacy with India amid growing domestic revolt over the country's ruling BJP and their treatment of ethnic minorities, frequently had the president ignoring his top advisors, refusing to listen to suggestions that had the president take a course of action that wouldn't avoid vague gestures and instead forced him to take a clear position. It got to the point an unidentified advisor said the president was bound to lose if he didn't start outlining where he stood, which resulted in Johnson slamming his arms on the Resolute Desk and shooting him a crazed, manic glare, much unlike the cool, charismatic persona he's crafted. He allegedly proceeded to scream, repeatedly, “I'm not supposed to lose!” He then, according to insider leaks, maintained the same posture and facial expression for the next five uninterrupted minutes. Afterwards, Johnson returned to his standard demeanor and apologized for the outburst, before taking a leave of absence for more downtime in the White House gymnasium he helped lead an expansion of a year or so prior. Before he made his exit, a staffer grabbed Johnson by the sleeve, with everybody's attention turning to the two. The staffer reportedly asked the president if he was okay and needed a mental health evaluation, to which Johnson chuckled, saying: “I've never considered committing suicide. I'm a president. And presidents don't commit suicide.”</p><p>In 2032, the president's issues have materialized in what seems to be a juggernaut ticket on the Republican side of the aisle, one which very well may threaten the possibility of reelection for the son of Rocky Johnson. Unable to rally behind candidates perceived to be more moderate and palatable to voters in the aftermath of Vance's loss, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson clinched the nomination, allied with House Speaker Abe Hamadeh as his running mate. The very threat the ticket poses to millions of Americans and the sanctity of America's institutions has raised the alarm bells throughout the Democratic Party, most especially when it comes to their leading man, who has been subject to relentless calls to call it quits. Resistant to such pleas, the president has soldiered on even as his popularity plummets to a record-low of 34% according to the latest estimate by Gallup.</p><p>The president's recent pivot to confrontational attacks have shaken his once pristine reputation, with direct insults and threats of violence against his opponent leading many in his party and in the media to question his mental fitness for the office. Comments by the president have drawn rebuke for their seemingly lackadaisical and cavalier tone. One recent offhand comment by the president at a rally in Minneapolis drew concern, when he said: “Carlson talks tough on China, I've done more than talk tough I've played tough and had them crawling on their knees when I was through, whether we're talking China or Chyna, and believe you me either of them would snap that bowtie-wearing dweeb in two.” Such crash and vulgar commentary has created nasty headlines and doubtlessly helped hurt the president's cratering favorability image. Another noteworthy incident involved the president posting to social media his joy at, according to him, “enjoying my first ever Philly cheesesteak,” while campaigning in Pennsylvania; this despite the fact the president has claimed he was engaging in the consumption of his “first ever Philly cheesesteak” a separate five times in the past 8 years, everytime posted to social media. These incidents, among many others like them, have all been subject to messaging tweaks that they're merely light-hearted “jokes” by his campaign team, no different than Carlson's jabs that the president is experiencing “roid rage on a national scale,” but such excuses have fallen flat.</p><p>In light of the Goldwater Rule, and with no concrete basis to launch any such comments from, many outlets have refused to go so far as to categorize Johnson's latest actions and outbursts as characteristic of an emotional breakdown, but various members of both parties haven't been so squeamish. “He's lost his mind,” Senator Malcolm Kenyatta of Pennsylvania, who unsuccessfully attempted to primary the president to no avail, bluntly stated to press in a recent interview. “If he had any sense, he'd let his ego stop dictating his actions, but now that he's successfully isolated himself, he's going to take us all down with him at our most crucial hour.” Asked if the president truly was experiencing the mentally deteriorative effects of long-term steroid usage, Kenyatta simply replied: “No comment.”</p><p>Ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with protests expected to measure in the tens of thousands, Johnson will need to rally his party at their most crucial hour. Even in light of skepticism from his left and right flanks, not everyone is so down on the <i>Southland Tales</i> star and WWE Hall of Famer. “He's going to win this an [sic] prove the doubters wrong,” wrote old Hollywood friend Kevin Hart on social media. “If I know Dwayne Johnson, and I know Dwayne Johnson, you're all going to be smelling what the Rock's cooking soon enough.”</p>`)

              <p>Published December 2, 2012</p><p>Allan Lichtman, the mind behind the '13 Keys to the White House,' which serves as a prediction system for estimating who will be the next president of the United States, is taking heat after incorrectly predicting incumbent Democrat Barack Obama would stay for another four years. Lichtman, a professor and former political candidate out of Maryland where he was arrested on charges of criminal trespass, argues he wasn't wrong at all, in fact.</p><p>With Obama managing to lose the popular vote and electoral college, Lichtman is serving up an alternative reason why the keys missed the mark.</p><p>“The keys to the White House are malleable,” he told us over the phone. “Between the time I expressed my estimation as to who would win based off the keys, the dynamics had changed.” Lichtman had stated Obama would win with the keys all the way back in July 2010, and repeatedly mentioned how he was confident in such an outcome transpiring. He had not previously suggested the keys were changing, though acknowledged the fallout from Lehman and the poor approval ratings plaguing the administration were a cause for concern by 2011. He nevertheless remained firm the passing of the large stimulus bill in 2009 shortly after the Great Recession hit would, overtime, improve Obama's economic outlook.</p><p>Lichtman had previously called the 2000 race for Al Gore, which he has attested as the keys predicting the popular vote winner over the actual winner of the election. Now with that benefit removed, he's eating crow among the online pundits. Since November, YouTube has seen many 'Barack Obama Can Never Lose' compilations, consisting of pundits and figureheads who held high confidence in the president such as Rachel Maddow and Bill Maher, along with Lichtman, being stitched together with energetic circus music playing over them making much hay of these (non-)Jimmy the Greeks of horse race contests.</p><p>Lichtman refuses to submit to mockery, though. “The keys did not fail, I failed the keys,” he said.</p>`)
