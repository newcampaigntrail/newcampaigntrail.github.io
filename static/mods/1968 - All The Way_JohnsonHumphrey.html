Charlie sat in the centre, on a crate, rocking slightly, his wild eyes reflecting the flames or merely projecting the fire within. His voice was like poetry, weaving through the wind like smoke, shrouding around them all.</p><p>"It’s happening," he murmured, fingers tracing lazy circles in the dust. "You all saw it, you all heard it." He grinned, a sharp and wide thing that sent shivers down Squeaky’s spine and raised every hair on her arms. "They put that man in the Big House. Just like I told you they would. Just like I said. The pigs let the Devil in. The Antichrist is here."</p><p>Squeaky’s fingers dug into her knees. She had seen it—on the broken old TV in the main house, the flickering, grainy images of Wallace’s victory speech, the crowd cheering, their faces twisted with something ugly. A shift in the world, in the balance. Helter Skelter had arrived.</p><p>"They’re gonna make it real easy for us now," Manson continued, his voice joyous, in an almost sing-song rhythm. "They’re laying the groundwork. The race war’s coming, man. It’s all lining up, just like I said. The black man’s gonna rise up, gonna take what’s his. And then—" he made a swift, slicing motion through the dusty air, "—he’ll need us to show him how to run the show. And we’ll be waiting. Oh man. We’ll be ready."</p><p>Someone whispered, "Yes, Charlie." Squeaky exhaled, realizing she had been holding her breath the whole time.</p><p>"Wallace is the last gasp of the old, man," he went on. "A death rattle. A corpse dragging itself with no legs. But they don’t see it yet. They think they won something. They think they got it all locked down." He giggled, shaking his head. "Oh man, they got no clue what’s coming. No clue at all."</p><p>The fire crackled, spitting embers into the darkness. Squeaky looked around at the others—eyes wide, mouths slightly open, all caught in the spell of his voice. It wasn’t just the words. It was the way he knew. He had always known.</p><p>He suddenly leaned forward, staring straight at her, and she felt her heart stutter.</p><p>"You feel it, don’t you?"</p><p>She swallowed hard, nodding. "Yes, Charlie.

But at the center of it all was her Lyndon, towering over the others like a prizefighter in the ring.</p><p>“Landslide Lyndon!” he roared, grinning wide, his cheeks red with victory. “They thought I couldn’t do it. Thought I’d go down in flames, that they could sink me.” He clapped his hands together, nearly sending his drink flying. “But I showed ‘em! FDR-LBJ! FDR-LBJ! You get it? Roosevelt and me, biggest damn victories in history!”</p><p>The room erupted in cheers. Staffers slapped backs, and glasses smacked together.

Just rubble, just ghosts.</p><p>His ‘uniform’—what the Americans referred to as pyjamas—was sodden with dust, his rifle slung over his shoulder out of habit more than need.

The great beast himself—Lyndon Baines Johnson—was finally at rest.</p><p>He let his eyes drift to Lady Bird, the ever-loyal soldier, standing ramrod straight despite the weight of a grief that Nixon suspected was heavier than anyone knew. He knew—oh, he knew—how Johnson had gone. An empty house, a body found before the press could get wind of it. The story carefully sculpted, just like everything else about the man’s final days. And now the Johnsons wouldn’t let history have the truth. So neither would Dick.</p><p>And yet here they were, the same men who had howled for Johnson’s blood, who called him a butcher, a crook, a tyrant. Now they wept into their handkerchiefs, spoke of his “great service,” of his “commitment to the Union,” of his “undaunted courage.” If there was one thing Nixon had learned in all his years, it was that Americans had no patience for failure, but every last one of them adored a fallen man.</p><p><em>Lose like a bum, and they'll trample you.</em><br><em>Die like a king, and they’ll name a damn airport after you.</em></p><p>He had beaten him.

Just one more time. Then he’d be untouchable.</p><p>The thought was warming, intoxicating. He let it settle over him, basking in the absolute finality of his triumph.</p><p>Still, there was a part of him—that felt something almost like admiration. For all the bastard’s faults, for all his blunders, Johnson had been a fighter. An SOB, sure, but a fighter. He had climbed and clawed and connived his way to the top, earned his seat at the table. And for a man like that, a man who lived politics, breathed it, bled it—losing like that must have been worse than death.</p><p><em>And maybe that’s why he took the gun.</em></p><p>Nixon gave one last look at the casket, at the crowds, at Lady Bird’s immovable stance.

It had happened exactly as he had feared, as he had told him it would happen. A truly embarrassing night for the party, a slaughter so complete it left the old bulls of the Senate shaken, speaking in hushed voices about what would come next. For Russell, there was no need for discussion. He knew. He had known for years. This was the natural consequence of Johnson’s arrogance, his foolish overreach. He had warned him, again and again. Push too far, and the country will push back harder. And by God, had they ever.</p><p>He poured himself a drink, the ice clinking as he leaned back in his chair, eyes settling on the rotary phone perched on the desk. He knew the call was coming. Just a matter of when.</p><p>It came just past midnight. Russell let it ring twice, then picked up.</p><p>"Well," he said, keeping his voice even, measured. "I expect you’re calling with an apology."</p><p>A dry chuckle from the other end, bitter and ragged. "That what you want to hear, Uncle Dick?" Johnson’s voice was thick, weighed down by exhaustion, by something heavier still.</p><p>"It’s what I ought to hear," Russell replied. "You took this party straight to hell, son. You dragged it kicking and screaming, and now you’ve left it in ruins."</p><p>There was silence. Russell could hear faint breathing, the sound of ice shifting in a glass.</p><p>"Well, when you’re right, you’re right Uncle Dick" Johnson said finally. His voice wavered, quieter than Russell had ever heard it. "They hated me. I thought… I thought I could bring ‘em around. Thought if I just did enough…"</p><p>His voice began to buckle. "But they wanted me gone—hell, they made sure I was gone."</p><p>Russell shut his eyes. Damn it all. He should have been relishing this, should have taken some satisfaction in knowing he had been right from the beginning. But there was no pleasure in hearing the President of the United States reduced to this.</p><p>"It’s over, son," he said, softer now. "Ain’t no use cryin’ over it. The people made their choice. And you—you did what you thought was right."</p><p>Johnson let out a shaky breath. "They’ll undo it all, won’t they?" His voice was distant, hoarse.</p><p>Russell exhaled, rubbing his temple. "Maybe," he admitted. "Maybe not. But you don’t get to decide that anymore."</p><p>Another silence, longer this time. Then, so softly Russell almost missed it: "It’s not our time anymore."</p><p>"Look. Get some rest, son," Russell said. "That’s what you do first. Get some rest. You’re still President after all."</p><p>Johnson didn’t argue. The line went silent.</p><p>Russell sat there for a long time, staring at the phone, listening to the empty hum of the receiver before it finally clicked.</p></div></div>`);

But at the center of it all was her Lyndon, towering over the others like a prizefighter in the ring.</p><p>“Landslide Lyndon!” he roared, grinning wide, his cheeks red with victory. “They thought I couldn’t do it. Thought I’d go down in flames, that they could sink me.” He clapped his hands together, nearly sending his drink flying. “But I showed ‘em! FDR-LBJ! FDR-LBJ! You get it? Roosevelt and me, biggest damn victories in history!”</p><p>The room erupted in cheers. Staffers slapped backs, and glasses smacked together. Lyndon was already onto his next thought, barking instructions, rattling off phone numbers. The machine never stopped.</p><p>Lady Bird watched him, smiling at first, waiting for his eyes to find her, for just a flicker of recognition, of gratitude. He was so good at this, the bigger-than-life Lyndon, the storyteller, the powerbroker. But she had known the man behind it, had seen him in his worst moments. She had stood beside him when others abandoned him, had lifted him up when even he doubted himself.</p><p>She took a step closer, standing at his elbow, waiting for him to turn. He will, just give it a second.</p><p>But instead, Lyndon turned, glass empty, and without looking, handed it to her.</p><p>“Bird, get me another, will ya?”</p><p>She hesitated for just a moment, fingers curling around the cold glass. Lyndon was already jabbing a finger at an aide.</p><p>“Damn it, I wanna talk to Bobby—no, not that one, the other one, give me the goddamn phone!”</p><p>Lady Bird swallowed, forcing a breath. “Lyndon—”</p><p>He barely glanced at her. “And fix your hair, Bird, it looks like a goddamn nest.”</p><p>No one laughed. No one even looked at her. The room moved forward without her, consumed by Lyndon’s orbit, eager for the next order, the next proclamation, the next victory.</p><p>She stood frozen, holding his empty glass, feeling the heat creep up her neck. He wasn’t trying to be cruel—he just was like this. He couldn’t help it.</p><p>She gripped the glass tighter, her breath hitching, a sharp sting behind her eyes. Not now. Not here.</p><p>The lump in her throat swelled, her vision blurred. She turned away quickly, heading for the bar, clutching the glass as hard as she could wishing it would shatter in her palm.</p></div></div>`);

The RPYF wasn’t some sellout SDS knockoff. They weren’t posers looking to dodge the draft and keep their place in the corporate world. They were the vanguard.</p><p><em>"I’m sure we’ve all seen the results of the latest ‘election’. Surprise, surprise—the elite isn’t going to save us.

What this country needs isn’t an election—it’s a revolution."</em></p><p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group. Fists clenched. Eyes narrowed. Hungry.</p><p><em>“As Trotsky said, ‘The oppressed class cannot liberate itself without breaking the chains that bind it to the ruling class.’ These people—the Johnsons—they aren’t going to step aside because we asked nicely. History tells us unless a movement refuses to fight, it is hopeless.”</em></p><p>She knew what people said about her. That radicals like her got movements crushed.

Ho Chi Minh sat at his desk, hands folded over rice paper. For the first time, he truly felt old. The spirit that once crawled through caves, ate rations in sodden fields, and rallied comrades across the countryside now struggled to string thoughts together. The war was everywhere: in the hum of insects, in the whispered voices of aides, in the silence between artillery strikes that no longer made him flinch. He was tired.</p><p>Even wearing glasses made his face ache. He knew with certainty he would not live to see the war’s end. Johnson wouldn’t either. That peace would belong to another generation. It was natural for revolutions to outgrow their leaders—but he couldn’t shake the ache. He wanted desperately to witness the culmination, to know the sacrifice had meaning. To breathe even a single day of peace in a free Vietnam.</p><p>And yet, there was still time.</p><p>He dipped his brush into ink and began—not to Johnson about terms, but an open letter simply titled ‘To the people of the United States.’ Not a political argument. A plea. A final effort for peace. A recognition that the war could only end one way.</p><p><em>"The days go by, we are all brothers, in each and every land. We fight against oppression, in order to be free.

Johnson would fight to the grave, as would he. And whoever came next would carry the war further still. He feared a day when even the Vietnamese would forget why they fought. When vengeance would replace liberation.</p><p>He folded the letter with care. It would be sent in the morning.</p><p>Then came the first rumble.</p><p>Faint. Distant. Then the walls shuddered. Sirens. Boots. Screams. Plumes of smoke rose as bridges crumbled and the earth shook with every blast.

Even more so on her underlings—she adored watching them try to wriggle out of the little verbal trap she had laid, understanding perfectly that no journalist or editor worth their salt could afford to give a real answer. And certainly not to the most influential woman in the whole news industry.</p><p><em>"Well … I don’t like to … my wife and I don’t discuss politics in public, she says it’s not polite,"</em> said the young man, who worked to pour some scotch and soda into his mouth, hoping to avoid another question.</p><p><em>"My, you’re secretive, gentlemen—I believe we’ve found the Wallace supporter amongst us,"</em> she said, eliciting the polite laughter of her patrons, attendees of the Graham election night party. <em>"There’s no need to play coy here. Believe you me, the more you try to hide it, the more people are dying to know. Whereas ask the same question to me and you’ll get a straight answer: I’m all the way with LBJ."</em> She gently clinked her glass with several others.</p><p>It was a curious kind of soirée on a very curious night. Any Washington party inevitably turned into a who’s who, and even on election night, Republicans, Democrats, and of course newspaper publishers intermingled, teasing one another. Katherine viewed such events as a healthy venture, a sign of a healthy democracy—that bitter rivals could eat and drink together without the butter knives being lodged in anyone’s backs.</p><p>But tonight was a different kind of night. In ’64 it was a damn sure thing—the Goldwater gang had thrown in the towel before the cocktails could be served and the presses of the Washington Post were already streaming out the pre-written pieces. And in ’60? Well, Philip had been managing things back then.</p><p><em>"Y’know, I must have told this story a thousand times, but if tonight isn’t the night I’ll tell it again: Philip was the person who told Jack Kennedy he just had to pick Lyndon. He said, ‘Jack, you’ve got to go with Johnson’—to put personality aside and think of the bigger picture."</em> She swirled through the room in an evening dress, her assistant feeding her updates via a landline in the room over.</p><p>After a while, it became hard for Katherine—hardly a poker player—to hide her own anxiety, twirling one of the pearls in her necklace as she confronted the news of Nixon’s improving chances.</p><p><em>"Now nothing’s certain, Katherine,"</em> said Ben, the Post’s new executive editor, who had begun to attend these events as if it were written into his contract. <em>"It’s been a rough year for the President."</em></p><p><em>"Oh, some things are certain, Benjamin. The sun will rise in the morning, rivers will flow to the sea, and Lyndon Johnson will be re-elected. What is it that Lincoln said—never trade horses in the middle of the stream? And that’s what this war is—a mighty stream."</em> The cheery grace she had at the night’s beginning had evaporated, replaced with the cold matriarch. <em>"And it would be unbecoming for a country to not recognize the President’s depth of devotion."</em></p><p>Her aide was gesturing to the phone now, but just for the moment—just for a few seconds—she chose to delay things. <em>"And whatever difficulties he’s faced, win or lose, as a country we owe him a great level of gratitude."</em></p><p class="ending-quote">She began that walk from the living room to the hallway, gripping the phone in one hand and her drink in the other, twisting the cord into knots.</p></div></div>`);

The secretaries, once cordial, now gave vague excuses or transferred him into an endless loop of extensions that led in circles. The Doctor’s patience eroded with every tick of the clock. The campaign was over, the election settled, and Henry Kissinger had backed the wrong horse.</p><p>It was only a few offhand comments, many months ago, that he had said Johnson was being <em>"prematurely written off"</em> and that the Republican Party looked poised to renominate Nixon—who was bound to self-destruct. A momentary lapse in judgment, and now Kissinger was about to be frozen out, while these ego-stroking morons were about to take the reins and steer the country off a cliff.</p><p>Kissinger couldn’t sleep. The thought of those buffoons inhabiting the White House gave him indigestion and killed his appetite. Desperate to save them from themselves, he pressed down on the receiver again to hear the same saccharine message:</p><p><em>"I’m sorry, but Mr. Haldeman is unavailable at the moment. Would you like to leave a message?"</em></p><p><em>"No thank you, Miss,"</em> he said politely. He had already left a message—he had left three goddamn messages—and all of them went unreturned.</p><p>These people had no idea the trouble they were wading into. Like apes who just got a hold of the nuclear codes, they needed someone in the room who could tame them. Nixon needed him—and now he had to read in the papers that Nixon was thinking of giving key positions to cowboys and loudmouths. Like it or not, Nixon needed him.</p><p>His soles ached from endless pacing. He rested for a moment to nurse his grieving feet, when the phone finally rang—a reply from the office of Charles Colson.</p><p><em>"Henry,"</em> Colson said, his tone dripping with smarm. <em>"What can I do for you?"</em></p><p>Kissinger inhaled sharply, already sensing the contempt lurking beneath the greeting. <em>"I wanted to discuss my potential role in the administration. I believe the President-Elect will find my counsel invaluable. This is an administration that can’t afford to wait—there is a lot of ground to cover, given the dismal way Johnson has handled things."</em></p><p>There was no immediate response. Dead air hung between them. Then Colson let out a short, dry laugh. <em>"You know, Henry, we’ve been talking about you. The consensus is that you’re a damn fine office intellectual, really—just top-notch. But this administration... it’s a team effort. And frankly, Henry, we’re not sure you’re exactly... on the team."</em></p><p>Kissinger clenched his fist, forcing his voice to remain even. <em>"I have served the interests of this country tirelessly and would serve this President with that same level of dedication. Surely my record speaks for itself?"</em></p><p>Colson sighed, the sound long and exaggerated, playing with Kissinger’s fate like a cat with string. <em>"Well, we’ll see how things shake out. Maybe you’ll hear something soon."</em></p><p>Another click. Another dead end. Surely this couldn’t be it. It wouldn’t be. There were other avenues to go down. This presidency was going to go down in flames—Henry was certain of it. These men thought because they could fool half the country into voting for them, they could fool everyone else too.</p><p>But still he waited by the phone.</p><p>The waiting was excruciating.</p><p>An hour passed.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Finally, the phone rang.</p><p><em>"Dr. Kissinger, I have Haldeman on the line. He says he can spare a moment."</em></p><p>Kissinger exhaled, patting down sweat from his scalp as he climbed up off the floor and into his chair, composing himself. <em>"Put him through."</em></p><p>He took a second, then calmly: <em>"This is Dr. Kissinger."</em></p><p class="ending-quote">Then Haldeman’s voice, smooth and unbothered: <em>"Henry. The President-Elect has been asking about you."</em> Kissinger exhaled, allowing himself a silent smile. <em>"I see."</em></p></div></div>`);

His lapdog LeMay stood beside him, an immovable slab of a man, his great ham hock of a head whirling around so fast it looked like it might topple off his shoulders. The men were laughing now, laughing and shaking hands, congratulating themselves for taking the country out of the frying pan and throwing it into the fire.</p><p>Then things began to shift. A ripple in the air, a wrongness creeping in at the edges. The corners. The walls began to bend. Wallace’s grin stretched wider—too wide—splitting his face like an open wound. LeMay’s eyes glowed, his flesh glistening, the flashing bulbs sputtering flames. An intense heat built up, and the carpets began to swallow the audience. The words coming from the speakers contorted into animal howls and shrieks.</p><p>It didn’t stop there.</p><p>Wallace’s skin rippled, bubbling up like molten lava before bursting into yellow pustules.

The rigid general with his ham hock head was gone. In his place, a hulking bright blue wildebeest, snorting, dragging his hooves on the podium, horns sprouting out of his head, jutting through his service cap, his nostrils flaring with each breath. Stamping the floor as microphones crackled and popped beneath his weight. His small black eyes locked onto the cameras, and he stepped forward, clearing his throat as the shit-throwing baboon hopped to one side.</p><p><em>"The end is in sight,"</em> he bellowed, as the journalists feverishly took notes, respectful of the general’s transformed state. <em>"We drop the bombs. Hanoi. Moscow. And for good measure, San Francisco."</em></p><p>The crowd murmured, nodding in agreement, as did the baboon. The air was thick with something—an invisible weight pressing down on my skull. A sharp sting at the base of my spine. Slimy sweat slicked my palms, my vision swimming. The walls of the room bulged and flexed, like the whole goddamn building was breathing.</p><p>No time. No time to think. I needed to move.</p><p class="ending-quote">Then the beast that had once been LeMay let out a triumphant snort. <em>"God bless America,"</em> he growled, and lowered his massive head, ready to stampede over me.</p></div></div>`);

J. Edgar Hoover lined up his shot carefully, his grip firm, his expression unreadable beneath the thick-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. Beside him, his deputy Clyde Tolson stood with his arms folded, watching intently.</p><p><em>"Good form, Edgar,"</em> Tolson said, right as Edgar raised the club. <em>"You've always had such a steady hand."</em></p><p>Hoover smirked, adjusting his stance. <em>"Don’t try to distract me, I’ve got enough on my mind at the moment."</em> He pulled back and swung.

They had the place booked out. When Edgar played, the rest of the course was cleared—no interruptions. Edgar needed the time to think, of just how the Bureau needed to handle this election fiasco.</p><p><em>"Johnson’s the smart bet,"</em> Hoover said, adjusting his glove. <em>"He knows the job, and barring any hiccups, is going to let me do mine. But the problem is his heart’s failing. I give it a year, maybe two, and then where does that leave us?"</em></p><p>Tolson nodded, tapping his putter against his shoe. <em>"The country needs someone who will let the Bureau do its job. Johnson is restless, and I’m sure you’ve seen the memos regarding resignations."</em></p><p><em>"That’s all election talk,"</em> Hoover agreed. <em>"Johnson respects power and respects people who know how to use it. He wouldn’t try it."</em></p><p>Tolson gave a theatrical shudder. <em>"I still think it should be Nixon.

The crisis facing the country was without precedent, and the consequences had never been graver—especially for Black Americans. The room was packed with representatives of the newly inaugurated Congressional Black Caucus, a collection of the nation’s Black congresspeople, all of whom had been elected in November. And Shirley Chisholm sat among them, still not yet officially sworn in, but prepared to cast what could be the most important vote of her career. As the elected representative for New York’s 12th district, she was here to listen. Or at least, that was what she was supposed to do.</p><p><em>"How exactly does a contingent election go?"</em> John Conyers asked. <em>"I understand the idea—the House votes for the President—but what are the actual mechanics? Is it just a 538 roll call?"</em></p><p>Adam Clayton Powell, the chair of the meeting, cleared his throat. <em>"It’s sorted by delegation. So for you, John,"</em> he raised a finger, <em>"you’ll be one vote of nineteen. The Constitution says, ‘a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice,’ but whether that means a majority in the delegations or a candidate needing 26 state delegations outright…"</em> He paused to look around at his colleagues. <em>"That’s for McCormack to decide."</em></p><p>Augustus Hawkins leaned forward, setting his cup down. <em>"McCormack is a loyalist. Unless Johnson has finally given up, he’ll interpret the meaning in whatever way gives Johnson the advantage. The question is—what’s that? A simple majority, or a full majority?"</em></p><p>Powell coughed. <em>"We should plan for both. But Johnson probably does better with a full majority. A lot of the states he won have high electoral vote counts, which means more representatives to wrangle. So… how are your delegations feeling? Michigan has too many Republicans. That’s a Nixon tally."</em></p><p><em>"Louisiana is Johnson country. We have discipline down here."</em></p><p>Charles Rangel nodded. <em>"New York is probably Johnson’s too, but we lost some seats. It’s a gamble."</em></p><p>A chuckle rippled through the room before Powell added, <em>"And thank God we don’t have to deal with a senator in here. Otherwise, we'd have to listen to Brooke’s nonsense."</em></p><p><em>"Hell,"</em> Conyers said with a smirk, <em>"Brooke is probably prepared to make that fry cook Vice President."</em> The room erupted in laughter, tension easing just slightly. Shirley sat still, her hands folded in her lap.</p><p>Augustus knocked on the table. <em>"We need to be practical. We need to make sure we can stop any deal between Nixon and Wallace, to make sure we can get the President re-elected."</em> Hawkins’s interjection was met with a near-uniform nod of approval. All agreed—but one.</p><p>Shirley straightened her back. <em>"Why are we talking about conceding to the President before we even make our demands?"</em> she interjected, her voice sharp but measured.</p><p>Several heads turned. Dawson let out a tired sigh, shaking his head. <em>"Shirley—"</em></p><p><em>"Congresswoman Chisholm,"</em> she corrected. <em>"I’m not even sworn in yet and you’re already trying to diminish me. I said what I said. We have leverage. We should be extracting definitive commitments from Johnson before we rubber-stamp him in. We don’t need half-baked assurances—we need policy, we need protections, and we need it in writing. I thought that’s why we’re here. The purpose of us being elected?"</em></p><p>The room fell silent. A few exchanged glances. Dave Nix, who had been silent until now, leaned forward. <em>"I get what you’re saying, Congresswoman. But this is our opportunity to prove to the President how much he needs us. We’re simply not in a position to make rash demands, not when there’s Nixon and Wallace threatening to take this country."</em></p><p><em>"But isn’t that what they always say?"</em> Shirley’s hands were firm on the table. <em>"There will always be Nixon or a Wallace to threaten us with. Surely if we don’t push, we get nothing? A pat on the head and a vague promise? This is our moment to demand something real. Otherwise, what are we even doing here!?"</em></p><p>Shirley’s lone voice stood, as the other congressmen nursed their coffees rather than look at her. Dawson sighed, rubbing his temple. <em>"This is about survival. Politics is a long game, Ms. Chisholm. This will be a new administration, and President Johnson knows who his friends are."</em></p><p>Shirley bit her tongue. She had made her case, but she could feel it slipping away. <em>"He also knows who he can walk right over."</em> But it was useless. The decision had been made before she even spoke.</p><p>Conyers finally knocked on the table, and Shirley’s esteemed colleagues took turns affirming a tepid ‘plan of action’ that didn’t even mention desegregation—until she finally relented to grant the agreement universal acclamation.</p><p class="ending-quote"><em>"Alright. We push Johnson, but we don’t demand anything that risks pushing even one vote away from him. We’ll go to the White House on Monday and press for the President not to give up the war against poverty."</em> Shirley inhaled sharply but said nothing. The room buzzed again. The conversation shifted. The path was set.</p></div></div>`);

Fawning, sycophantic, slathering on the praise, pleading for power. He had spent his life surrounded by men like this, and even now, confined to this chair, unable to fully speak, they still hovered like flies around a carcass, utensils in hand.</p><p><em>"Historic, truly historic, Mr. Kennedy."</em></p><p><em>"Your boy did it, just like you always said he would."</em></p><p><em>"Another President Kennedy, sir. You must be proud."</em></p><p>Joe Kennedy sat motionless, his fingers twitching slightly against the armrest of his ornate wheelchair. His lips parted just a fraction, his body still while his eyes whirled and his mouth curled with great effort. The stroke had stolen his body from him, but his mind remained intact—a blessing and a curse. He could listen and think, but few cared to listen as they once did.</p><p>The television droned on in the background, every word more important than the empty platitudes of the men in the room. And when one dared stand in the way, all Kennedy could do was stare daggers through the back of his head until he finally moved his paunch out of the way. He focused on it, tuning out the murmurs of the hangers-on. The cadence of the announcers was steady but electric, filled with numbers, percentages, counties flipping, states being called.</p><p><em>"... and that puts Kennedy at 256 electoral votes, still too close to call, but Kennedy’s lead is holding..."</em></p><p>Joe exhaled through his nose, his fingers curling slightly. Scraping fingernails against wood. <em>Not good enough.</em></p><p>This was supposed to be decisive. A knockout. Not another knife fight. The people should have recognized the choice before them. This was destiny. Divine providence—and yet, here they were, haggling for every vote like some hackneyed two-bit city boss.</p><p>A glass appeared in front of him, and for a moment, his pulse quickened. Then, just as quickly, it was pulled away again and replaced. <em>Water. Not whiskey. "Damn doctors."</em></p><p>His fingers clenched against the armrest. He had never followed orders from anyone, and had torn down anyone who looked down their nose at him along the way. But they had stripped it all from him. The warmth of a drink, the fire in his throat, the small pleasures that reminded a man he was still alive. He had given everything for his sons, built them brick by brick into what they were meant to be. And now, he was reduced to this.</p><p>The television glowed, showing a crowd cheering, signs waving. The newscaster’s voice swelled. There he was. Young. Smiling. Soaking in the adoration, eating up that applause. Wasting precious time.</p><p>Joe tilted his head slightly toward the screen. He wanted to speak, to bark orders, to tell him what needed to be done next. The cabinet, the alliances, the deals. And above all else, undoing the mess left behind by that hillbilly bastard Johnson.</p><p>Joe wanted to tell him. If he could just get Bobby on the phone. If he could just stay awake long enough to set things right. But exhaustion tugged at him, a deep, heavy thing. He fought it. He had so much more to do. So much more to say. If he could just—</p><p>His fingers slackened against the armrest.

The lights flickered with an electric hum, casting creeping, murky shadows along the peeling walls. In the bunk across from him, a man sat in silence, head lowered—the type who knew better than to ask too many questions. That was fine by him.</p><p>Hoffa leaned back, a slow smirk stretching across his face as he exhaled through his nose. The news had arrived just hours ago—Bobby Kennedy was finished. The bastard had gone down, just like he always knew he would.</p><p>He dragged a hand through his thick hair, fingers tapping against his temple as he chuckled, low and satisfied. <em>"What’d I tell ya, huh? You play too many fuckin’ enemies at once, you think you're some kinda fuckin’ golden boy, and before you know it—boom—you’re eatin’ dirt. Kid thought he was untouchable. But nobody’s untouchable. Certainly not a fuckin’ Kennedy."</em></p><p>He spat on the floor and cracked his knuckles, slow and deliberate, one at a time. <em>"He should count himself one lucky sonofabitch, though. At least he gets to walk away. If this was real justice, he’d be layin’ six feet under, like his brother, seeing the inside of a casket instead of some goddamn Senate seat."</em> He shook his head, exhaling sharply. <em>"But it’s fine. He’s out. He’s done. That’s all that matters."</em></p><p>The words rolled out like a victory toast he couldn’t yet drink. He had worked hard for this moment, manoeuvring from behind bars, passing messages, pulling strings, making sure the right people got the right calls. He might be inside, but he was never out of the game. And Nixon? Nixon understood how the game worked.</p><p><em>"See, Nixon’s a real man,"</em> he said, rolling his shoulders. <em>"He may be in politics but he sees it the right way. What matters is power, and who’s got it. And let me tell you somethin’, I got it. I still got it. And once I walk outta here—and believe me, that’s gonna be real soon—I go right back where I belong. Back to business, back to the real life."</em></p><p>Frank remained silent.</p><p>Hoffa snorted, shaking his head. <em>"What, you ain’t got nothin’ to say? What, you think little Bobby’s sittin’ somewhere cryin’ into his drink, beggin’ his father for another handout, wonderin’ how Hoffa pulled one over on him!?"</em> He let out a laugh, short and sharp. <em>"That’s the thing about these rich-boy types. They got all the money in the world, all the connections, but they never learned how to fight dirty. Not like us. You and me. The people that built this country. You, me and Nixon."</em></p><p>The quiet stretched between them, but Hoffa barely noticed Frank’s stillness. He was too busy picturing his return—the headlines, the men lined up to shake his hand again, to beg for forgiveness.</p><p>Then, a shift. The slightest movement from Frank in the dim light.</p><p class="ending-quote">And the wire slipped around Jimmy’s throat.</p></div></div>`);

The wipers dragged across the glass, smearing the water in long swooping arcs, clearing the way ahead. The two boys sat stiff in the car seats—Bill the passenger and Frank the driver—up the winding leaf-strewn street. Ahead, the <em>‘Welcome to Canada / Bienvenue au Canada’</em> sign loomed under the moonlight.</p><p><em>This was it.</em></p><p>The pair sat in silence most of the journey. Idle chit-chat had fallen away the closer they got to the border. It was easier to watch the trees rush by and shrink into the distance, listening as the radio grew fainter and the static consumed the voices the further they drove. Bill wondered if there were any Canadian stations they could pick up. Wondered if they would be in French. Wondered if he should learn French.</p><p>He paused from the wondering and adjusted the collar of his damp shirt. He felt overdressed. But then again, what is someone supposed to wear for such an event? Was there an outfit one was supposed to wear when fleeing their country?</p><p><em>"Last chance,"</em> Frank said, half joking.</p><p>Bill stared ahead. The checkpoint was barely staffed. Two booths. A few sleepy truckers waiting for clearance. No men in uniforms hunting for deserters. And even if they were, it’s doubtful they’d care about two shaggy-haired white kids in a Ford Falcon—it’s not like they hadn’t seen this before.</p><p>The car rolled forward. A Canadian officer stepped out—young, dark-haired, no older than them. He tapped the window.</p><p>Frank rolled it down. <em>"Just visiting some friends in Montreal."</em></p><p>The officer nodded, glanced at their passports. <em>"How long you staying?"</em></p><p>Bill felt the words choke in his throat.</p><p>Frank answered for him. <em>"A while."</em></p><p>The officer gave a tired nod, not even looking at him. <em>"Welcome to Canada."</em></p><p>The gate lifted. The car inched forward. Bill turned, looking back at the United States for what might well be the last time. The gas station. The weather-beaten highway sign. The road that led back to home, to Arkansas, to hope, to everything he’d spent his whole life working toward.</p><p>Now he was running. Like a coward. And when people found out, he’d never be able to return.</p><p>He could hear his father in his ears—what he’d think of him. If he were alive, he’d probably die of embarrassment... or of laughter. But he wasn’t here. And Bill knew that if he followed that draft letter and spent the next years sitting in some swamp, he’d end up just like him. And that scared him far more than moving to Canada.</p><p>But it didn’t stop the weight pressing on his chest. It didn’t stop the feeling that he was turning his back on something bigger than just this war.</p><p>Frank turned up the radio.</p><p class="ending-quote">Bill didn’t say anything.

McGovern’s loss was not only a political defeat; it was something deeper, something more existential. It was the confirmation that the forces of history were not moving forward in some linear, inevitable march toward progress. It was the understanding that all of it—the marches, the protests, the furious debates—could be undone by a single vote cast in quiet cowardice.</p><p>And yet, the faces of the Nixonettes shined with triumph.</p><p>In the span of months, the women’s movement had gone from a force to be reckoned with, which would conquer Washington, to a joke. To teenage girls, secretaries, housewives in red-white-and-blue sashes, their pleated skirts pressed just so, their lips painted the color of American virtue, screaming for a man who would never respect them. Cheerleaders for Nixon like it were just another hometown football game. And maybe that’s exactly what it was—one big pep rally for the patriarchy, a resounding victory for the very forces that told these women their highest achievement would be to stand on the sidelines and look pretty, and maybe pump out a baby or two in between trips to the nail salon.</p><p>It would have been easier to dismiss them as fools, but that wasn’t quite right. These women weren’t all stupid. They had simply chosen their safety over their dignity, their fathers over their sisters. They had decided it was better to be protected than to be powerful.</p><p>And then there was Pat Nixon. The perfect woman. The kind of woman that mothers raised their daughters to be. She was everything I was supposed to want. Silent, supportive, endlessly patient. A woman who stood in the background while the men talked. A woman who smiled through indignities so old and deep she had stopped recognizing them as wounds.</p><p>The Nixonettes were as much a product of 1950s suburbia as the man they idolized—a man who had learned long ago how to work their fears, how to sell them the illusion of strength while embodying only its shadow. Nixon was the ultimate patriarch, not because he was powerful, but because he was weak, insecure, desperate for validation. A man who had been rejected by his betters so often that he needed to dominate his lessers to feel whole.</p><p>And now the country had given itself to him, handed over its future to the same small and frightened men who had always been there, waiting for their chance to punish the world for making them feel small.</p><p>The cheers of the Nixonettes rang in my ears as I left the rally, past the girls with their fresh-pressed sashes, past the secretaries who would spend their lives in typing pools, past the housewives who were already congratulating themselves on having voted the right way. I wondered if, years from now, any of them would look back at this moment and wonder what they had done.</p><p class="ending-quote">But I knew better.

Ralph Nader had taken his seat toward the far end, near the unassuming plaque that read: SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. It still didn’t seem real. Only months ago, he had been organizing consumer safety reports, compiling dossiers on corporate neglect. Now, he was about to take his seat at the cabinet table.</p><p>The room was abuzz with conversation. It was a mix of old Washington hands and fresh faces, the kind of cross-section of the Democratic Party that reflected the unlikely coalition that had carried Ribicoff to victory. Nader’s eyes scanned the room, cataloguing the figures who had been summoned to chart the next four years of American history.</p><p>At the far end, Hubert Humphrey was in the middle of an animated conversation with Walter Reuther. The new Secretary of Labor was in his element, gesturing with his hands as he spoke, his voice carrying just a little too loudly over the low murmur of the room. Nader noted how Humphrey, now the Secretary of State, nodded along with his signature Minnesotan affability, even as his eyes flicked around the room, as if already sizing up the political undercurrents.</p><p>Across from them, a different kind of discussion was unfolding. Patricia Harris, the new Attorney General, sat with her hands folded, listening intently as Michigan Governor George Romney leaned in slightly, his bumbling voice softened for the moment. A Republican in a Democratic administration—one of Ribicoff’s many gambits. Harris, the first woman to hold her post, exuded an air of unshakable poise, getting Romney shaking in his Mormon boots. If she was concerned about sharing a table with men who had spent their careers in political trenches opposite hers, she gave no indication.</p><p>On the opposite side of the table, economist John Kenneth Galbraith, freshly appointed as Treasury Secretary, exchanged a few words with Clark Clifford, the holdover from Johnson helming the Department of Defense and then Nader’s gaze shifted to the other side of the table, where Ted Sorensen, Jack Kennedy’s speechwriter had been coaxed out of retirement for a role as a special advisor, sat quietly. Near her, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the intellectual force now leading Health, Education, and Welfare, scribbled notes on a legal pad, brow furrowed.</p><p>Despite himself, Nader couldn’t ignore the sense of unease creeping at the edges of his mind. He had spent his career railing against Washington’s excesses, against its closed-door meetings and political compromises. Now, here he was, part of it. In the belly of the beast.</p><p>The doors at the far end of the room swung open. The room fell silent. Heads turned.</p><p>The President had arrived.</p></div></div>`);

    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> Welcome back. My guest tonight is Gary Sinise—Steppenwolf founder, veteran of stage and screen, and now the man behind one of the most talked-about performances of the year. I am, of course, referring to <em>Wallace</em>, the historical drama that earned Sinise his first Oscar win.</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> Thank you, Charlie. Good to be here.</p>
    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> Congratulations on the Oscar.</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> Thank you. That one’s still sinking in.</p>
    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> You’ve played some intense men before—Harry Truman, Lt. Forrest—but this role, portraying President Wallace... that’s a different beast entirely. What drew you to it?</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> You know, Charlie, I’ve played powerful men, broken men, angry men—but Wallace was all three. That’s a deep, dark well to draw from. And when I first read the script, it scared me. Which is why I just had to do it.</p>
    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> The backlash has been intense. That this isn’t historically accurate, an insult to Wallace’s memory. It’s been called a piece of propaganda and a number of states have attempted to boycott the film’s release—Governor Jim Folsom, I believe, called it 'an insult to the great man's memory'.</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> I’ve heard it all. But it’s not our job as filmmakers to polish the past. It’s based on history, but it’s really an intensely personal film.</p>
    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> You’ve said before that you had to “go to a very lonely place” to find Wallace. What did that entail?</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> It meant sitting with hate, Charlie. Any man who ever met George Wallace came away certain that he believed nothing, but hated everything. And the only way he could fill that void was with power.</p>
    <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> There’s a scene in the film—Wallace in the Oval Office, after decision has been made to drop the bomb on Haiphong. There’s no sound, just you, working through it. Is there a reason the attack isn't depicted?</p>
    <p><strong>Gary Sinise:</strong> We stay with Wallace because this is one of the few moments he attempts some kind of introspection—when he’s left for the first time to actually contemplate what he’s done. We should leave that story to be told by others.</p>

        <p><strong>President Robb Faces A Tough Road Ahead</strong></p>
        <p><em>Washington —</em> President Robb is now facing the political fight of his life. With economic anxiety rising in the wake of the ARPA-Net Bubble, a foreign debacle in Somalia, and tense disarmament negotiations with the Soviets, many in Democratic Party are openly questioning whether Robb can deliver a second term.</p>
        <p>Support for his sweeping domestic agenda the <em> Millennium Mission</em> — a $2 trillion overhaul of public housing, child care, and education — Robb now finds himself fending off attacks from both flanks. Republicans are rallying around former Vice President Pierre du Pont without much of a fight, something that White House insiders have been a little shaken by. Du Pont's has derided the Presidents “fiscal recklessness” and “moral confusion abroad,” while firebrand televangelist Pat Robertson has launched a third-party bid and is quicky gaining in the South and Midwest.</p>
        <p>“There is a deep hunger for clarity and purpose in America,” Pat Robertson declared at a rally in Tulsa last week. “Not more useless Washington programs, not more New World Order bureaucrats — but God, family, and country.”</p>
        <p>“The President’s struggling to find the moment,” said UVA professor Larry Sabato. “He's tried to resurrect his domestic policy, but things are moving slowly and the country wants someone who can step on the gas pedal.”</p>
        <p>Whether Robb can revive the campaign may depend on if he can sway enough Americans to get back on board with his economic strategy. “We’ve still got a long road ahead,” Robb told reporters last week. “But I didn’t come this far to turn back now.”</p>

            Chris Pratt Explores Presidential Bid
        </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #555;"><em>By Jason Carter, Political Correspondent</em><br>Published: September 15, 2023</p>
        <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS (DEADLINE)</strong> — Chris Pratt, the Hollywood star, has officially announced his candidacy for President of the United States as an independent, promising to 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“unite America”</span> and 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“bridge the divide.”</span></p>
        <p>“I’m not running as a Democrat, I’m not running as a Republican,” Pratt said in a speech outside his childhood home in Minnesota. 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“I’m running for America.”</span></p>
        <p>Pratt’s entry into the race comes amid a heated showdown between President Andrew Cuomo and former President Schwarzenegger, setting up a repeat 2024 election. Pratt has attempted to distanse himself from any partisan labels, previously stating he doesn’t fall on 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“either side”</span> except for the  “wide of the voter”.</p>
        <p>Early polling suggests Pratt could have an impact — particularly among voters who describe themselves as 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“just wanting things to be normal again.”</span></p>
        <p>Whether his star power will translate into votes remains to be seen, but as one supporter put it: 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #b10000;">“If he can save the galaxy, he can probably save the country.”</span></p>

            <p>The ceasefire of late 1968, brokered under the strict electoral time limit, was greeted by many in Washington as a personal triumph for President Lyndon Johnson. It was a bitter irony that the same man derided for his bloody-minded escalation was now being hailed as the architect of peace. The American president, gripped by a fatal mixture of personal ambition and moral exhaustion, had staked what could have been his final year in office on convincing the country that a path out of the jungle now existed.</p>
            <p>Yet for those on the ground—especially the veterans of the savage fighting at Khe Sanh and Daido—the peace agreement wasn’t worth the paper it was written on. Among the men of the 9th Infantry, there was no illusion that the shooting had stopped. “We were still getting hit at night,” remembered Sgt. Larry Meeks. “Only difference was, we weren’t allowed to shoot back unless we had permission from some damn major half a world away in Saigon.”</p>
            <p>Private First Class Ronnie Martinez, barely nineteen, remarked to a reporter in late November, “This war ain’t over. It’s just waiting.” Within weeks, Ronnie’s prediction bore fruit. Reconnaissance patrols reported fresh infiltration across the Laotian border. Communist caches in the A Shau Valley swelled with supplies. South Vietnamese desertion rates ticked back upward—by Christmas, over 12,000 ARVN troops had walked off the job.</p>
            <p>As the chapter turned into 1969 and Johnson placed his hand back on the Bible, American generals began once more to speak the language of “escalation control” and “search and destroy.” The machinery of war, momentarily interrupted, purred back to life. On January 20, a low-level firefight near Pleiku left four Americans dead. There would be no official retaliation. But as Maj. William Haponski later wrote, “Everyone knew the terms of peace would hold only so long as they were inconvenient to break.”</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px !important; color: #333;">EPISODE 3: “Flag In The Sand (1970–1971)”</h3>
        <div style="font-size: 13px; color: #777; margin-bottom: 10px;">September 29, 2017 | By Alex Strachan</div>
        <p><em>It almost seems redundant, but there it is:</em> Part three of Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s <strong>The War in Yemen</strong> opens with a content warning. Discretion is advised for language, violence, and of course, graphic content.</p>
        <p>Yes, because <em>The War in Yemen</em> is intended for a mature audience — and no, because as visceral and disturbing as “Landing the Flag (1970–1971)” is, the darkest chapters are naturally still to come.</p>
        <p>History may not repeat itself, but as this hour makes heartbreakingly clear, it echoes. “Landing the Flag” begins not with Yemen, but with Vietnam — airlift footage from Hanoi, the crackling radio voice of a general declaring “stability.” Within a year, U.S. troops are planting another flag, this time in the sands of Hodeidah.</p>
        <p>This episode gets personal fast. We hear from former Army corpsman Daniel Stillwell, who describes arriving at the Yemeni port city in what he thought would be a limited humanitarian deployment. “I was handed a rifle before I had boots off the tarmac,” he recalls. “That’s when I knew this wasn’t gonna be peacekeeping.”</p>
        <p>It’s a theme that haunts the episode: the eternal lie of <em>‘limited warfare’</em>. Recovered intelligence briefings, newly declassified, show White House aides warning “another Vietnam,” only to be met with stony silence.</p>
        <p>Burns and Novick pull no punches. “Landing the Flag” is more than a chronicle of military escalation — it’s the story of a country re-learning nothing, fast. And it hurts to watch.</p>
        <p>There are seven more hours to go. And already, the nightmares have started.</p>

        <strong style="font-family:monospace;color:#122f5f;">[00:00:30 – Secretary Les Aspin]</strong> Good afternoon. I’ll start with a few key points about the current security situation in South Vietnam, and then General Powell will provide additional details. First, let me stress that what we are seeing in the Mekong Delta and several of these demilitarized provinces is not a part of some new offensive, but rather an intensification of localized insurgent activity. These incidents are disruptive, but our intelligence does not indicate any kind of coordinated national effort at this time. And there has been no uptick in material losses. Secondly, U.S. support remains steadfast. We continue to work with our regional partners to ensure stability in the region. U.S. advisors, logistics, and support for all three zones of engagement—land, sea, and air—will remain in place, and President Kerrey reiterates his commitment to our allies. Finally, I want to emphasize that our long-term strategy is not changing. The United States has maintained a presence in the region for decades, and until some form of peaceful agreement is reached between all parties, our goals will not change. We have adapted over time, but our core objectives remain consistent. And now General Powell.

        <strong style="font-family:monospace;color:#122f5f;">[00:02:00 – General Colin Powell]</strong> Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I’ll add that our presence continues to operate with utmost efficiency and precision. The U.S. 7th Fleet is actively patrolling to prevent smuggling operations that supply Viet—cough—that supply local insurgents. Additionally, we have doubled our intelligence-sharing efforts with local commanders to anticipate and neutralize potential threats well before they emerge. We are seeing a continuation of asymmetric tactics from the insurgents—targeted bombings in urban centers, and efforts to undermine democratic and civic institutions. These tactics are familiar, and they have not changed, nor have they proven any more effective. What has changed is our ability to counter them. Advances in reconnaissance, drone surveillance, and precision strikes have allowed us to mitigate their impact significantly. We are taking active preparations to secure this year’s Tet celebrations to ensure they are protected and no incidents can occur. That said, to reiterate what Secretary Aspin and indeed the President have been saying: This is a long-term mission, and we have complete and total confidence in the ability of our servicemen and women to remain committed to the stability of the region. We have every reason to believe our efforts are succeeding.

        <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Weiner launches presidential campaign</h2>
        <p><em>By JOSH FELDMAN</em><br>
        03/01/2015 11:42 AM EST | Updated: 03/01/2015 03:27 PM EST</p>
        <p><strong>NEW YORK —</strong> Anthony Weiner, the mayor of New York City and one of the most explosive figures in Democratic politics, has officially launched his campaign for president Sunday despite the recent cloud over his mayoralty.</p>
        <p>“We need someone who’s willing to stand up and take the heat and fight,” Weiner said in a campaign video released online. “That’s what I’ve always done as Mayor. And that’s exactly what I’ll do as president.”</p>
        <p>Weiner becomes the third major Democratic contender in the race, joining Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Evan Bayh. His campaign will likely test how much the public is willing to forgive—and perhaps even embrace—a candidate who has become synonymous with scandal.</p>
        <p>Weiner, 50, has spent years rebuilding his image after a series of high-profile controversies stained his image. But as New York’s mayor, he has since gained a reputation as a relentless political brawler despite lurid accusations and the recent Tinder controversy seems to have put no dent his aspirations for higher office.</p>
        <p>“Anthony Weiner has made mistakes,” said one longtime adviser. “But voters see a fighter. And after four years of Newt Gingrich, they’re not looking for a saint—they’re looking for someone who can win.”</p>
        <p>His supporters are leaning into the candidate’s unapologetic persona. “He never gives up,” said Sharon Marcus, a Weiner backer from Des Moines. “You can’t beat our Weiner.”</p>
        <p>Polling shows Weiner trailing Bayh by single digits and insiders believe his name recognition could give him an edge in early primaries, meaning his scandals could in-fact prove an asset.</p>
        <p>The first Democratic debate is scheduled for June.</p>

        <p><strong>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA —</strong> James Earl Ray, the alleged assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., died yesterday in Pretoria at the age of 74, decades after fleeing American authorities.</p>
        <p>Ray, convicted in absentia for King’s 1969 assassination in Atlanta, spent decades on the run, escaping to Rhodesia shortly after the killing. There, he lived under an assumed name until the collapse of white minority rule in 1980 forced him to flee to apartheid South Africa, where he again took on a false identity.</p>
        <p>His long fugitive status came to an end in 1996 when Nelson Mandela’s government, acting on new intelligence, captured Ray living quietly in a Pretoria suburb under an alias. His arrest reignited questions about how he had managed to evade capture for so long and whether he had received financial or logistical support from unknown accomplices.</p>
        <p>Ray was set to be extradited to the United States, but his health rapidly declined. He died of liver disease before facing trial, leaving many unanswered questions.</p>
        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #444; padding-left: 10px; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #555;">
            “James Earl Ray’s death closes a chapter, but the full story of Dr. King’s assassination remains untold. We will continue to demand the truth.”<br>
            <span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 13px;">— Statement from the King Center, Atlanta</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The King family has long maintained that the U.S. government was complicit in the assassination and that Ray was only a pawn in a larger conspiracy. Coretta Scott King repeatedly called for a full investigation, but no definitive evidence of government involvement was ever produced.</p>
        <p>Though Ray is gone, speculation and unanswered questions about one of America’s most infamous political assassinations remain.</p>

      By Mark Harrison | July 13, 2013
    </p>
    <p><u>The Beatles</u> faced enormous expectations when they took the stage at <u>Live Aid</u> in July of 1985. The event featured a staggering lineup of legends — Prince, <u>Led Zeppelin</u>, <u>U2</u>, <u>David Bowie</u> — but none were more anticipated than the Fab Four. After years of rumors and near-misses, the impossible was finally happening: <u>John</u>, <u>Paul</u>, <u>George</u>, and <u>Ringo</u> were reuniting.</p>
    <p>They’d asked for no introduction. Just after 7:00 p.m. London time, as the sun dipped low over Wembley, the crowd erupted at the first unmistakable chords of “<u>Help!</u>” From there, the Beatles powered through “<u>Get Back</u>,” “<u>While My Guitar Gently Weeps</u>,” and a euphoric, crowd-led “<u>Hey Jude</u>.”</p>
    <p>They hadn’t played together in 16 years, and some critics expected a rusty, nostalgic set. Instead, the performance was tight, raw, and deeply emotional. <u>Lennon</u> and <u>McCartney</u> shared a mic again. <u>George</u>’s guitar wept. <u>Ringo</u> kept it steady.</p>

            The only thing assassinated here is history. It’s not a movie, it’s a three-hour slander.

                <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #555; color: #ffe600;">Political Career</h4>
                <p>Johnson ascended following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His early administration was defined by the Vietnam escalation and a sweeping domestic surveillance expansion. Though widely expected to step aside in 1968, classified files now confirm cooperation between the Johnson White House and Veidt Intelligence in disrupting the candidacies of both Robert Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #555; color: #ffe600;">Vietnam War</h4>
                <p>In 1969, Johnson authorized a covert bio-enhancement program aimed at psychological conditioning of combatants. These experimental therapies—later attributed to Veidt Industries—dramatically altered battlefield morale but led to neurological breakdowns in civilian populations across the DMZ. Johnson’s refusal to withdraw from Vietnam and the nation's admission as the 51st state led to mass riots and multiple states of emergency.</p>
                <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #555; color: #ffe600;">Operation Perseus</h4>
                <p>In 1973, fearing total collapse of public order, Johnson greenlit “Operation Perseus,” a continuity-of-government programme that led to the construction of an automated command hub beneath the Texas Hill Country. By 1976, reports emerged of Johnson’s extended absence from public appearances. It was later confirmed he had undergone partial neural integration with Perseus, becoming the first cybernetic executive officer in U.S. history.</p>
                <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #555; color: #ffe600;">Events of Watchmen</h4>
                <p>By the time of the Watchmen timeline, Johnson remains the President via holographic projection. He is feared and revered by both American citizens and Soviet leadership as an omniscient, unkillable head of state. Following the Reagan Riots, Johnson authorized full deployment of the Minutemen Recovery Directive, reactivating retired vigilantes for indefinite domestic stabilization.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Presidential Illness: Past and Present</h2>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — With President Kennedy hospitalized and a Vice President moving into the uncertain role of 'acting president', the nation again finds itself confronting a crisis in the executive branch. But this is hardly the first time such a vacuum has gripped the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>From Woodrow Wilson’s incapacitation to Dwight Eisenhower’s heart issues, the hidden vulnerabilities of the presidency have quietly reshaped history. Yet perhaps no moment is as shrouded in intrigue as the illness of Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
        <p>Though officially labeled a heart attack in 1970, speculation has long suggested Johnson suffered a debilitating stroke — one that left him incapable of fully discharging his duties and the transfer of power during this illness was entirly obscured from the public, the press, even to the President's close allies.</p>
        <p>Only one person really knows the whole truth: First Lady, Claudia 'Lady Bird' Johnson. While the President retrenched to the LBJ Ranch in Texas, far away from prying eyes, Lady Bird became his eyes and ears in Washington, stepping into roles never publicly acknowledged. She oversaw Cabinet meetings, guided correspondence, and, relayed the President's messages and, by several accounts shaped domestic and even foreign policy.</p>
        <p>"She protected his legacy, absolutely," said Robert Caro, Johnson’s most acclaimed biographer. "It was a role that Mrs. Johnson had occupied previously—she took over his congressional duties during the Second World War."</p>
        <p>Caro and others believe Lady Bird’s influence during this period has been underappreciated, if not deliberately obscured. “Lady Bird Johnson was willing to go to any lengths necessary to protect her husband's image and power,” Caro once remarked, suggesting the existence of what some now call a ‘Shadow Presidency.’</p>

            <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #333;">As the race heats up, the legacy of Reagan may hold the key for one candidate</p>
            <p style="font-size: 11px; color: #999;">June. 9, 2004, 6:12 PM EDT — Source: nbcnews.com</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Ronald Reagan is gone—but not from the conversation. And in this election, the memory of the man who reshaped American conservatism may just shape its future one more time.</p>
        <p>The 2004 presidential race had already taken on a chaotic three-way energy before Reagan's passing in June. With President Ralph Nader (D)  and Governor Whitman (R) attempting to woo over the last few delegates she needs to capture the nomination, Senator Oliver North (C), was stuck polling in the mid-20s, anticipated to place behind the Democrats and the Republicans.</p>
        <p>But the death of Reagan, the hero of the new right and co-founder of the Conservative Party, who spearheaded the party’s first major electoral victory—has briefly realigned the conversation.</p>
        <p>Memorials and coverage of Reagan's long goodbye have reminded voters of a more confident, forceful conservatism. The last Conservative President, Carroll Campbell, left office after his diagnosis with Alzheimer’s and has not been able to campaign for the party since, leaving a hole. And many on the right are now wondering if North might be their best shot at reclaiming that legacy over that of Whitman with flash polls suggesting the party has indeed recieved a boost from this coverage.</p>
        <p>North’s campaign has also leaned into it. His latest ads quote Reagan directly. He’s been photographed at Reagan’s California ranch. At a rally in Nashville, North told a crowd: “This party was built by a man who believed in peace through strength, in family, in faith, and in America’s destiny. We have wandered—but we are far from lost.” and the Conservative convention promiseses to be a full Reagan administration reunion, where the party hopes that the bounce it will recieve will catapult the party back into the limelight.</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">Edited and introduced by Jeremy D. Bailey</p>
        <hr style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Frost:</strong> Mr. Nixon, following in 1974, you first emerged with allegations that your campaign was illegally targeted by the Johnson administration. Do you stand by those claims here, today?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Nixon:</strong> Absolutely, David. And I don’t make them lightly. I’ve been in politics for decades, I’ve seen the hardball, I know the lengths that people will go to. But what the Johnson White House did to me, to my family—it went far beyond politics. It was something else entirely, rankly David it was criminal. I was shocked. Truly shocked. You see, you expect the other side to campaign against you. You don’t expect them to turn the entire machinery of the federal government into a personal attack machine, to target a political campaign it's unheard of.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Frost:</strong> Specifically, what are you alleging?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Nixon:</strong> Let me lay it out. My wife, Pat—her calls were tapped. Her mail was opened. I had campaign offices broken into—yes, broken into—by federal agents. They stripped our files. They took documents. They planted stories. They tailed me. Not just me—my aides, my friends, my donors. Do you understand what that means? I had colleagues in business that I was relying on, coming to me and telling me, “Dick, I’d help you, but I’m being threatened.” That’s not democracy, David. That’s tyranny.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Frost:</strong> And you’re saying this continued even after the election?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Nixon:</strong> Of course it did. Even in defeat, I was a threat to them. The Johnson people wanted to make sure I’d never get off the mat again. I lost in November. But the surveillance? The intimidation? The blackmail attempts? They stretched well into the new year. They were frightened I’d speak out. They wanted me humiliated. Destroyed. It wasn’t enough to win—they wanted to crush me.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Frost:</strong> Did you consider going public with this at the time?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Nixon:</strong> David, if I’d gone public then, who would’ve believed me? It would be ‘oh here’s Loser Nixon again.’ The press was in Johnson’s pocket. And I was exhausted. You have to understand—I gave everything in that campaign and I knew that even if I was believed it would blow up the country. Accusing the President of that, at that time, would have at a very sensitive time, crippled the United States government. What you need to understand David was I didn’t get into politics for power, I did it for the public.</p>

        <h3 class="locked-title">The Triumph of Power</h3>
        <p><strong>Robert Caro’s Long-Awaited Fifth Volume Arrives</strong></p>
        <p>As far as historical biopics go, few if any in American history have been as eagerly anticipated as the latest installment of Robert Caro’s monumental series on Lyndon B. Johnson. After years of exhaustive research and painstaking writing, <em>The Triumph of Power</em> delivers a breathtaking account of Johnson’s first full term in office from 1965 to 1969—an era defined by towering legislative victories, deepening divisions over Vietnam, and a political will that culminated in a historic victory.</p>
        <p>Caro’s command over the Johnson narrative remains as sharp as ever. The book follows the President as he seizes the moment after his accidental ascent, forging the Great Society through a Congress he bent to his will. <em>The Triumph of Power</em> captures Johnson in his element: bullying, cajoling, and outmaneuvering his adversaries to pass Medicare, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. But just as he reached the zenith of his ambitions, the war in Vietnam—despite his best hopes—swallowed his presidency whole. Caro doesn’t just document the policies; he captures Johnson’s agonies, from the self-doubt behind closed doors to the desperate struggle to keep his coalition intact.</p>
        <p>The book’s final act is unlike anything else in Caro’s work. Johnson, against all political wisdom, chooses to run for re-election in 1968 and triumphs in a landslide over Richard Nixon, securing the Democratic dominance he had fought for his entire life. This turning point is treated with Caro’s typical rigor, making it feel as inevitable as Johnson’s other victories.</p>
        <p>Yet, <em>The Triumph of Power</em> is shadowed by an unspoken truth. Caro, now in his late 80s, acknowledges in his afterword what readers have long feared: he may not live to complete the sixth and final volume. As the historian who chronicled Johnson’s obsession with power now faces the limitations of his own.</p>
        <p>It is an extraordinary book, not just for what it reveals about Johnson, but for what it tells us about Caro himself: a man racing against time to finish the work of a lifetime. Whether or not he succeeds, <em>The Triumph of Power</em> ensures that Lyndon Johnson’s story—and Caro’s will endure.</p>

        <p><strong>Megan Marshack, Aide to President Rockefeller, Dies at 86</strong></p>
        <p><em>New York —</em> Megan Marshack, the longtime aide and confidante to former President Nelson A. Rockefeller, who found herself at the center of decades-long speculation about the circumstances of his sudden passing in 1979, has herself passed away at the age of 86. Her death was confirmed by her family, who noted that she had written her own obituary, which included an admission that the persistent rumors about Rockefeller’s final moments were indeed true.</p>
        <p>Marshack, a discreet yet influential figure in the Rockefeller administration, had remained silent for over four decades regarding the night of January 26, 1979, when the former president suffered a fatal heart attack. Initial reports claimed that Rockefeller had died alone in the Oval Office, working late into the evening, but the rapid emergence of conflicting details led to widespread speculation. Over the years, it became an open secret that he was, in fact, in the intimate company of a close aide.</p>
        <p>In her obituary, Marshack has finally set the record straight, stating that she had been present at the White House and specifically the Lincoln Bedroom when he collapsed and that they had, in fact, been engaged in a romantic affair prior to and during his presidency. While stopping short of revealing explicit details, she acknowledged that their relationship had gone far beyond professional boundaries.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller, who ascended to the presidency in 1972, has always been a larger-than-life figure and his untimely passing—marking the third consecutive president to die in office—continues to make headlines.</p>

                In a delayed but major development, NBC News has projected that former President Donald Trump has won New York—five days after clinching a national landslide. Once a Democratic stronghold, the state flipped with Trump now leading by over 30,000 votes.

            <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6;">
                The prolonged count was attributed to mail-in ballots and slow precinct reporting. While Democrats anticipated challenges, few expected Sam Nunn to lose here. Weak turnout in New York City, surging Republican numbers in the suburbs, and notable demographic shifts all contributed to the upset.

    <p>Up to four players campaign for the presidency in the most divided election in modern memory. Victory requires 270 electoral votes—but with the country split four ways, the real game may begin after the polls close. If no one wins outright, Congress decides... if it can.</p>
    <h4>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 CANDIDATES</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Richard Nixon</strong> – Incumbent. Starts with strong money and Southern support.</li>
        <li><strong>Henry “Scoop” Jackson</strong> – Democratic nominee. Powerful in unions and cities.</li>
        <li><strong>Eugene McCarthy</strong> – Peace and Freedom insurgent. Begins with bonus media influence.</li>
        <li><strong>George Wallace</strong> – Independent firebrand. Controls key Deep South states.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>📍 SETUP</h4>
    <p>Each candidate begins on their home state, with campaign funds and media points distributed by the Campaign Manager. The map includes all 50 states with electoral vote values.</p>
    <h4>🎲 HOW TO PLAY</h4>
    <p>Players take turns rolling dice and moving across the map. Landing in a state allows you to campaign, fundraise, or buy influence. Media cards and Event cards affect gameplay—some boost your campaign, others unleash scandals or protests.</p>
    <h4>🗳️ ENDGAME</h4>
    <p>If no candidate reaches 270, the election goes to the House of Representatives Phase. Players must negotiate, form coalitions, or stall for dominance.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: normal; border-bottom: 1px solid #a2a9b1; padding-bottom: 8px;">The Crooked Deal (1969)</h1>
    <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
    <p><b>For the general concept, see</b> <span style="color: #0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Corrupt Bargain</span>.</p>
        <p><b><span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">The Crooked Deal of 1968</span></b>, also known as the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Second Crooked Deal</span>, the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Wallace Bargain</span>, or the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Electoral Compromise of 1968</span>, refers to an alleged political agreement between President <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Lyndon B. Johnson</span> and Southern electors to resolve the contested outcome of the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">1968 United States presidential election</span>. The purported deal, which remains a topic of historical debate<sup>[1]</sup>, resulted in Johnson serving a second full term after the election was thrown to the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">House of Representatives</span> due to a split <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Electoral College</span>. In exchange, Johnson is believed to have agreed to cease enforcement of federal desegregation policies, securing the support of Southern electors who had initially pledged their votes to <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Alabama Governor George Wallace</span><sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
        <p>While no written record of the agreement exists, contemporary reports and later historical analyses suggest that Johnson's sudden reversal on civil rights enforcement in early 1969 aligns with political maneuvering necessary to ensure his retention of the presidency<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
        <p>The <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">1968 election</span> was one of the most chaotic in American history. Amid widespread social unrest, racial tensions, and the unpopular <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Vietnam War</span><sup>[4]</sup>, the race became a three-way contest when George Wallace, running as a segregationist independent, won several Southern states, preventing both Nixon and Johnson from securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win. With neither major party candidate winning an Electoral College majority, the election was thrown to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives under the contingent election process outlined in the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Twelfth Amendment</span><sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
        <p>Historians have debated the specifics of what Johnson allegedly promised to secure the Southern electoral votes needed to win in the House. The prevailing theory suggests that Johnson brokered an agreement with Wallace-aligned electors and key Southern Democratic congressmen, agreeing to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Halt the enforcement of school desegregation in the South<sup>[6]</sup>.</li>
            <li>Curtail federal civil rights interventions, particularly regarding voting rights and integration efforts<sup>[7]</sup>.</li>
            <li>Appoint conservative justices to the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Supreme Court</span>, reversing the trajectory of the <span style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: underline;">Warren Court</span>’s progressive rulings<sup>[8]</sup>.</li>

        <p><strong>MONTGOMERY</strong> — Former Alabama Governor and perennial presidential candidate George Wallace, undeterred by past defeats, announced Friday that he will once again seek the presidency in 1992.</p>
        <p>Wallace, who has run in every election since 1968, said he was motivated in this cycle by frustration with both President Weld’s handling of the economy and former Secretary Ferraro’s “bleeding-heart liberalism.”</p>
        <p>“I have said before and I will say it again: There ain’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two,” Wallace told supporters at a rally in Montgomery. “This country is in need of real leadership. The American people deserve better.”</p>
        <p>Despite shifting political winds, Wallace has reliably carried at least one state in every election since his first campaign, maintaining a loyal base of supporters who continue to see him as a champion of Southern values.</p>
        <p>The former governor, now 72, has seen his once-dominant hold on the Deep South erode as younger generations seek to distance themselves from his particular brand of southern values.</p>
        <p>Still, Wallace remains confident that his message of law and order will resonate, and has sought to distance himself from his firebrand rhetoric of decades past, tying himself to the evangelical movement of born-again Christians—the same rhetoric he utilized in his comeback bid for the Alabama governorship.</p>
        <p>“I have fought the pinheads in Washington for decades, and I’m not stopping now,” he said. “This country needs a dose of compassionate conservatism to set us back on track.”</p>

    <p><strong>By Staff Writer | The Washington Post</strong><br>Tuesday, October 3, 2000 · 7:08 PM EDT</p>
    <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — As the first presidential debate looms, the three major contenders in the 2000 race are locked in one of the closest contests in recent memory. A new tracking poll released Tuesday evening shows Reform Party nominee Jesse Ventura, Republican Colin Powell, and Democrat Tom Hayden separated by just two percentage points—well within the poll’s margin of error.</p>
    <p>Ventura holds a narrow lead with 33 percent of likely voters, followed closely by Powell at 32 percent and Hayden at 31 percent, according to data compiled by CNN. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. The tight spread underscores the fluidity of a campaign season already shaped by eight years of Ross Perot’s Independent/Reform Party leadership and a public eager for change—but clearly uncertain about which direction that change should take.</p>
    <p>Tonight’s debate is expected to shine a spotlight on foreign policy, particularly the topic of foreign trade and relations with the Soviet bloc—including whether to normalize diplomatic ties with Vietnam. Powell, a former general and national security adviser, has emphasized the need for greater accountability from Hanoi and progress toward democratization. However, he has also suggested that diplomatic overtures to non-Moscow-aligned Soviet states—such as Vietnam, Yugoslavia, or the United Arab Republic—may ultimately serve U.S. interests.</p>
    <p>Governor Hayden is calling for closure and further détente with communist nations, describing reconciliation as essential to turning the page on a divisive chapter in U.S. history and beneficial to the economy. Ventura, meanwhile, has aligned with President Perot’s position, insisting that no reconciliation should occur until “all POWs have been returned and their families made whole.” His stance on broader U.S.-Soviet relations, however, has been inconsistent at times.</p>
    <p>With just over a month remaining until Election Day, the dynamics of the race remain unpredictable. Analysts suggest that tonight’s debate may serve as the campaign’s first clear inflection point.</p>
    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #444; padding-left: 10px; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #555;">
        “We’re in uncharted territory,” said one veteran strategist. “We're probably headed toward another messy election.”

        <h1 style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Crack in US–South Africa Alliance As Airstrikes Intensify</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #555;">By Thomas Ellison</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">President Kaine’s steadfast support for South Africa is facing its first significant challenge, after a deadly series of attacks by armed MK fighters left dozens of civilians dead, prompting South Africa to launch airstrikes in neighboring Zambesia.</p>
        <p>The strikes, described as “retaliatory and proportionate” by the government in Pretoria, have drawn sharp international condemnation and are being investigated as potential war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Notably, the United States abstained from a UN vote condemning the strikes — a marked departure from its past automatic support for Pretoria and a clear signal of a growing schism between the Kaine administration and the government of President Pieter Mulder.</p>
        <p>In an interview with <strong>Axios</strong> Thursday night, President Kaine was asked whether the United States would continue to provide defense assistance to South Africa should the current military campaign escalate. “Of course, South Africa has every right to defend itself,” he said. “But the protection of civilians is paramount. We’re speaking very candidly with President Mulder about this issue.”</p>
        <p>This marks the first time in over four decades that a U.S. president has publicly signaled hesitation in providing arms to South Africa. The shift comes amid growing pressure from protesters and interest groups lobbying Democratic lawmakers to halt support for what many now view as a reckless campaign.</p>
        <p>South Africa’s President Pieter Mulder, in a televised address Friday morning, warned of a growing communist-backed conspiracy. “Make no mistake,” he said. “These terrorists are not acting alone. They are supported, armed, and encouraged by the regime in Harare and their Soviet masters in Moscow.”</p>
        <p>Mulder went on to express his “surprise and disappointment” at the American response, warning that “any reconsideration of arms transfers would signal weakness to the enemies of Western civilization.”</p>

        <p><strong>PAUL UPSETS BUCHANAN, WINS AIP NOMINATION</strong></p>
        <p><em>By Thomas R. Whitaker | March 3, 2004</em></p>
        <p>In a stunning upset, Texas Congressman Ron Paul has secured the nomination of the American Independent Party (AIP), defeating longtime party standard-bearer Pat Buchanan and Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue. The victory marks a significant shift for the AIP, signalling a move away from its traditionally regionally focused campaign and toward a broader national agenda.</p>
        <p>Paul, a longtime advocate for limited government and non-interventionist foreign policy, captured 42% of the vote in yesterday’s nationwide primary contests, edging out Buchanan, who finished with 38%. Perdue, trailed with just 9%.</p>
        <p>Speaking to supporters in Houston, Paul declared his victory “the beginning of a new era for the American Independent Party,” vowing to champion <em>“constitutional government, fiscal responsibility, and an end to the bipartisan consensus on endless war and corporate welfare.”</em></p>
        <p>Buchanan, who carried the party’s banner in 1996 and 2000, acknowledged defeat but did not endorse Paul, saying only that he would “pray for the future of the party.” Perdue, whose campaign struggled to gain traction outside his home state, called for unity and appeared to endorse Paul though it remains unclear whether more AIP voters will rally behind Paul’s vision.</p>
        <p>Paul now heads into the general election against Secretary Lugar, and Democratic Governor Gray Davis. Polls featuring a Lugar–Davis–Paul matchup project a tighter race, and this sudden AIP shift could make 2004 yet another deadlocked contest in the making.</p>

    <h3 class="locked-title">Duke Wins</h3>
    <p><strong>BATON ROUGE, LA</strong> — In a result that has shocked the nation, David Duke (R) has been elected governor of Louisiana, defeating Lt. Governor Kathleen Blanco (D) with 51.4% of the vote. The outcome has sparked protests across the state, with thousands gathering in New Orleans and Baton Rouge to denounce Duke’s past ties to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
    <p>President Cuomo issued a scathing condemnation of Duke’s victory, calling it “a disgraceful moment for Louisiana and for America.” Civil rights leaders have vowed to resist Duke’s administration, with the NAACP warning of a rollback in racial progress.</p>
    <p>Duke’s campaign focused on crime, taxes, and government corruption, but his victory was driven largely by white voters disenchanted with the political establishment. Blanco, who carried over 90% of Black voters, was unable to overcome Duke’s appeal to rural and working-class white Louisianans.</p>
    <p>National Republican leaders distanced themselves, with President Cuomo making it clear that Duke does not represent the party. Meanwhile, businesses and civil rights groups are threatening boycotts.</p>
    <p>“The fight isn’t over,” Blanco told supporters. “We will not let hate define our state.”</p>

        Top Ten Moments In Presidential Debates

            #7: The Empty Chair
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="#">1992 presidential debates</a> delivered plenty of memorable moments, but none quite as awesome as then <strong>Los Angeles Mayor Clint Eastwood’s (R)</strong> now-famous showdown with Paul Simon</p>
        <p>Facing off against <strong>Vice President</strong>, Eastwood seized an opportunity to frame Washington as way out of touch with the American people. When Simon attempted to defend the administration’s efforts to work with Congress, Eastwood gave that famous starte and let loose, as the famously tight-lipped politician really let Simon have it.</p>
        <p><em>“You know, I keep hearing how Congress can’t pass a budget, can’t pass tax reform, can’t get anything done,”</em> Eastwood said with a smirk. <em>“Maybe instead of debating you, Mr. Vice President, I ought to be debating an empty chair. I’d get the same results.”</em></p>
        <p>Despite the tight audience restrictions, the reaction to Eastwood's movies quality line-reading was immediate—gasps, and applause.</p>
        <p>Simon tried to fire back, <em>“You can make a great speech, Mr. Mayor,”</em> Simon responded, <em>“but being President isn’t about who has the best one-liners.”</em></p>
        <p>But the debate was already over <em>“Well, Mr. Vice President,”</em> he said, <em>“I know a bad script when I see one—and Washington’s been running one for years.”</em></p>

            <p><strong>NEW YORK —</strong> U.S. intelligence officials have linked <em>Sarayāt</em>, an emerging militant network, to a series of attacks targeting Western interests across Europe and the Middle East. Authorities now identify Sirhan Sirhan, a former American as a senior figure within the organization, with mounting evidence of his role in operational planning.</p>
            <p>The group has claimed credit for—or is suspected in—bombings in Istanbul, Madrid, and Amman over the past year. “This is no longer a local phenomenon,” one senior counterterrorism official told NBC. “<em>Sarayāt</em> and other Anti-American groups are evolving. What we’re seeing is an organization testing the with an objective.”</p>
            <p>Investigators suggest the group’s expansion reflects an internal shift, with Sirhan pushing for bolder, more deadly attacks on the U.S. Sirhan who has been a person of interest in several investigations is notable for his personel history with the United States gave an interview to western outlets in 1998 where he  outlined his opposition toward American foreign policy in respect toward Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Muslim world as a whole.</p>
            <p>The National Security Agency has raised the United State's terror alert status warning that <em>Sarayāt</em> could attempt a high-profile operation liekly on U.S. soldiers operating abroad but potentially U.S. soil </p>

        <p>July 15, 2021 / Updated July 15, 2021 — <em>By Michael Thompson</em></p>
        <p><strong>Louisville, KY</strong> — KFC announced Tuesday it will remove <strong>Colonel Harland Sanders</strong> from its branding due to his 1968 vice presidential run alongside segregationist <strong>George Wallace</strong>. Parent company <strong>Yum! Brands</strong> said the decision aligns with efforts to promote racial equity.</p>
        <p>"Colonel Sanders is a major part of our history, but his political ties no longer reflect our values," said Yum! Brands CEO <strong>Lisa Walton</strong>.</p>
        <h4><u>Rebranding Efforts</u></h4>
        <p>KFC will phase out the Colonel’s image from signage and packaging by year’s end. Historians note Sanders’ allegations of racism and his presense on the 1968 presidential campaign of Alabama Governor George Wallace, a noted opponent of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
        <p>"His presence on branding reminds many of a painful past," said <strong>Dr. Jamal Richardson</strong>, professor of American history at Howard University.</p>
        <h4><u>Social Media Response</u></h4>
        <p>The decision has sparked some backlash. Some say it’s long overdue, while critics call it corporate overreach. <em>"Outragous, will no longer buy KFC, strickly a Popeye's gal now"</em> tweeted activist <strong>Kimberly Harris</strong>. Others argue the Colonel's legacy is culinary, not political.</p>
        <p>Despite backlash, KFC stands firm, pledging <strong>$10 million</strong> to racial equity initiatives, including scholarships and funding for Black-owned businesses.</p>
        <h4><u>What’s Next?</u></h4>
        <p>KFC has yet to announce a new mascot or branding direction. But it has been rumored that the company will veer into more traditional influencer based marketing and has reached out to numerous celebrities including James Franco, Louis C.K. and Casey Affleck.</p>

        <p><strong>AL-QUDS —</strong> As news of former U.S. President John B. Connally’s passing spread, an outpouring of grief has swept through Palestine, where he remains a towering figure for his role in securing the Arab-Israeli Peace Process. Flags in major palestinian cities of East Jerusalem and Ramallah are flying at half-mast, while crowds gathered at John B. Connally International Airport to lay wreaths in his honor.</p>
        <p>Yasser Arafat, former President of Palestine and another key figure in the 1974 peace accords brokered under Connally’s leadership, expressed deep sorrow over the loss. “Connally was a man of conviction, a leader who saw justice not as an abstraction but as an obligation. Without him, our path to statehood would have been far more uncertain.”</p>
        <p>While Connally’s domestic legacy remains mixed, with a polling of recent Presidents by Historians ranking him the worst Presdident in recent history due to his many controversy's and eventual impeachment his reputation in the Arab world is one of complete admiration. The Jordan Accords laid the foundation for a two-state solution, formally recognizing an independent sovereign Palestine and securing an unprecedented commitment to mutual peace and security.</p>
        <p>Palestinian television stations aired archival footage of Connally’s historic visit to Gaza in 1982, when he walked the newly established streets of an independent Palestine, greeted by throngs of people chanting his name.</p>

        <p><strong>A Texas Earthquake?</strong></p>
        <p>November is fast approaching, and the battle for the White House is intensifying. While attention remains focused on battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia, the real shock of 2024 may come from a state long considered untouchable: Texas.</p>
        <p>Since it's founding with very few exceptions, the Lone Star State has stood as a Democratic stronghold, holding firm even in Republican wave years, when even in landslides Democratic candidates like Bentson and Governor Richardson held the state—even as the rest of the South lost it's allegience. But today, shifting demographics, internal party fissures, and a resurgent Republican operation may have finally put Texas in play.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, President Reich took the state easily. But with Republicans now choosing to fight the president—particularly over his immigration strategy—the political ground seems to be shifting beneath his feet.</p>
        <p>Then there is the Suarez question. As the Florida Governor edges closer to the Republican nomination, he has aggressively courted the state’s diverse electorate. Meanwhile, Representative Ted Cruz has mounted a barnstorming tour across East Texas and the Panhandle in a heated rematch against Senator Beto O’Rourke.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party has clearly noticed the tightening polls. Governor Ron Kirk has worked overtime to shore up the party’s foundation, pitching himself as the voice of “real Texas”—God-fearing, hardworking, and loyal to the land. But even Kirk’s full-court press may not be enough to heal the cracks.</p>
        <p>Recent polling shows Suarez narrowly trailing Reich in the state by just two points—well within the margin of error. If Texas flips, the consequences could reshape the political map for a generation.</p>

        <p><strong>Amid Party Upheaval: President Ends Re-election Bid</strong><br><em>Tuesday, January 20, 2004 | By Nathan Caldwell, Inside Politics</em></p>
        <p><strong>CNN Exclusive:</strong> President Richard Gephardt will formally announce Tuesday that he is ending his re-election campaign, following those shocking results in early primaries and stagnant approval ratings. The announcement marks an abrupt reversal for a president who, just last week, insisted he was “in this race until the end.”</p>
        <p>The President has not endorsed a successor, though senior aides suggest Vice President Robert Menendez is likely to receive his backing soon. In a brief statement, the White House cited “the need to place the nation's priorities above partisan campaigning” and warned that a prolonged primary battle could distract from ongoing military operations in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Gephardt’s decision comes amid a series of cascading political crises: Senator Paul Wellstone’s insurgent campaign has drawn blood, the death of Rev. Sharpton has rattled the Democratic base, and persistent rumors swirl that fmr Secretary Kennedy may be preparing to enter the race.</p>
        <p>“We hoped to take this campaign all the way,” Gephardt is expected to say in prepared remarks at the Americas Center in St. Louis. “But the fight ahead is bigger than me. I will dedicate my final year in office to ensuring America’s economy remains resilient and that our mission abroad is seen through to completion.”</p>
        <p>Vice President Menendez’s team is reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal campaign launch by the end of the week. But with Wellstone surging and the Kennedy shadow looming, the path forward remains anything but clear for the Democratic Party.</p>

            <p><strong>SAIGON, Vietnam —</strong> President Dao Minh Quan has become the first democratically elected leader of the Republic of Vietnam to be removed from office, after the Constitutional Council upheld a vote by the National Assembly to impeach him on charges of corruption, abuse of power, and unlawful delegation of state authority.</p>
            <p>Quan, who had led South Vietnam since 2004, was accused of colluding with senior officials to pressure corporate donors into funding private foundations operated by close associates, including Cabinet Secretarys Trieu Thanh Hoa and Tran Trung Nguyet Anh.</p>
            <p>The scandal widened when allegations surfaced that classified military intelligence was leaked to unofficial advisors—among them Nguyen Thuy Lieu and policy strategist Dr. Quach The Hung. The most serious charge involved Quan’s alleged attempts to shield Le Hoang Bao Long, an Army major, from criminal prosecution over ilicit defense contracts.</p>
            <p>Friday’s unanimous ruling by the Constitutional Council brings an abrupt end to Quan’s presidency and clears the way for potential prosecution, as he no longer enjoys immunity.</p>
            <p>A snap election must be held within 60 days, under Vietnam’s post-2000 constitutional reform. Vice President Pham Lisa is expected to serve as acting head of state. Sources indicate multiple candidates from both the liberal and nationalist camps are expected to enter the race.</p>

        <p><em>By Greg Vaughn</em></p>
        <p><strong>April 6, 2011 | Washington, D.C.</strong> — House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled today what he called a “modernized, results-oriented” revival of President Richard Nixon’s Family Assistance Program—or F.A.P.—an ambitious welfare overhaul first passed by Congress in 1969 and largely retired by the 1990s.</p>
        <p>“President Nixon was ahead of his time,” Ryan said, solemnly gripping the podium. “His F.A.P. was a bold, deeply penetrating policy—designed to go straight to the heart of America’s social safety net. What we’re doing today is honoring that legacy. The Democrats have for the last twenty years tried to end F.A.P. when what it needs is a helping hand.”</p>
        <p>The new proposal aims to streamline federal benefits, enforce work requirements, and eliminate redundancies. “Too long has F.A.P. been criticized by liberals,” Ryan continued. “It's been slandered as cold, when the truth couldn't be any more different. It’s time to bring it back—stronger, sturdier, and stiffer than ever.”</p>
        <p>In Washington policy circles, the reaction was instant and divided. One aide familiar with the drafting process commented, “Paul has always admired how Nixon handled his F.A.P. — this isn’t just another sloppy handout. It’s a real, hands-on approach.”</p>
        <p>Democrats, for their part, were quick to denounce the initiative. “This is a return to the politics of shame,” said Senator Durbin. “This new F.A.P. is not what our seniors deserve, working families get nothing from this F.A.P.”</p>
        <p>And opposition to this new F.A.P. has already sparked street level opposition, with Anti F.A.P. messages trending on social media and thousands coming to congress to rally against the leglislation. With a single message unifying them "No F.A.P." </p>

        <p><em>CNN WOLF BLITZER REPORTS</em><br>
        Aired: May 14, 2003 — 20:00 ET</p>
        <p><strong>WOLF BLITZER, HOST:</strong> Tonight, President Quayle continues to push for his controversial Social Security reform plan, a proposal that has met stiff opposition from Democrats in Congress. One of its most vocal critics? A man who has been in the Senate for more than three decades, former presidential candidate and longtime New York senator Robert F. Kennedy. I sat down with him to discuss his views on the future of Social Security and the broader implications for working Americans.</p>
        <p><strong>BLITZER (on camera):</strong> Senator Kennedy, always a pleasure to speak with you.</p>
        <p><strong>SEN. ROBERT F. KENNEDY (D), NEW YORK:</strong> Always good to be here, Wolf.</p>
        <p><strong>BLITZER:</strong> You’ve been one of the strongest voices against President Quayle’s proposed Social Security reform, which includes so-called "partial privatization." Why do you believe this plan is the wrong direction?</p>
        <p><strong>KENNEDY:</strong> Well, the problem with this proposal is that it undermines the fundamental promise we’ve made to the American people. Social Security isn’t just a program — it’s a commitment, one that ensures a basic level of dignity for retirees. If we start gambling with that security, shifting it into private investments, then what happens when the market dips? People’s retirements shouldn’t be at the mercy of Wall Street. We’ve already seen what happens when financial speculation runs unchecked, and I don’t believe we should be applying that same risk to something as critical as Social Security.</p>
        <p><strong>BLITZER:</strong> Some of your colleagues, even within your own party — Senator Koch, for instance — have signaled a willingness to compromise. Are you open to negotiations on this issue?</p>
        <p><strong>KENNEDY:</strong> I’m open to making Social Security more sustainable, but certainly not by carving it up and handing it over to private entities. There are ways to ensure long-term viability without jeopardizing the benefits that working Americans rely on. If the president wants a real conversation about that, I’m happy to have it. But right now, this proposal isn’t a compromise — it’s an abandonment of the principles that built the program in the first place.</p>
        <p><strong>BLITZER:</strong> The administration argues that this plan would give younger workers more control over their retirement savings. Does that argument hold any merit to you?</p>
        <p><strong>KENNEDY:</strong> Look, we all want workers to have more control over their futures. But there’s a difference between empowerment and abdication of responsibility. Social Security is supposed to be a guarantee — not a gamble. What happens to a worker who retires right after a market crash? The government shouldn’t be in the business of leaving seniors at the mercy of Wall Street’s highs and lows. This plan isn’t about control; it’s about shifting risk away from the government and onto individuals who can least afford it.</p>
        <p><strong>BLITZER:</strong> You’ve been in the Senate for a long time now. Your brother Ted left office some years back, and there hasn’t been another Kennedy stepping forward. Do you see a future for the Kennedy political legacy?</p>
        <p><strong>KENNEDY:</strong> I’ve never believed in dynasties, Wolf.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Harris team weighs resignation strategy</h2>
        <p><em>By JOHN P. LATTIMER</em><br>
        06/07/2024 06:48 AM EDT</p>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> Vice President Kamala Harris and her team are actively debating whether to resign the vice presidency to launch a campaign for the 2024 Democratic nomination, a move insiders have begun referring to as “The Fire Exit.” The strategy, while unprecedented in modern politics, is gaining traction amid growing concerns about the electability of the Bloomberg administration.</p>
        <p>The idea carries limited historical precedent. In 1968, Vice President Hubert Humphrey stepped down to distance himself from the unpopular Johnson White House. While no other vice president has executed such a move since, similar strategies were reportedly considered during the Pataki and Agnew presidencies. Vice President Hagel notably disinvited President Pataki from his nominating convention, and Vice President Armstrong nearly resigned from the Agnew administration before a last-minute intervention stopped him.</p>
        <p>Sources close to Harris say groundwork is already underway. A new campaign logo—“totally alien” from the defunct Bloomberg re-election materials—has been finalized. Internal polling is being conducted to gauge public reaction to a resignation strategy, and initial findings reportedly show a divided response.</p>
        <p>Inside Harris’s inner circle, opinions are split. Some advisers fear the move would alienate Bloomberg’s remaining moderate base and brand Harris as a “California radical.” Others argue that a clean break is essential. “She needs to tell her own story,” one Democratic strategist said. “Otherwise, she risks sinking with the administration.”</p>
        <p>White House officials are said to be deeply concerned. A sudden resignation could destabilize the party’s razor-thin Senate majority, derail pending legislative efforts, and further weaken an already embattled presidency. “It’s a high-risk maneuver,” one senior official said. “And we’re already bleeding political capital.”</p>
        <p>For Harris, the question may no longer be whether to run—but how far she’s willing to go to do it on her own terms.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Like I said why did Gore think it was a good idea to be so close with Clinton? After 8 years people must have had enough of him and that is without factoring in the scandals. It's like Gore wanted to lose.</p>

            He basically made his whole campaign about defending Clinton. Allowing Dole to walk over him by promising a clean break, allowing Dole to be the 'fresh face' an F rank campaign, it shouldnt have been as close as it was, voters just wanted the drama to be over, and he gave them none.<br>

            Dole framed herself as the "responsible candidate." It was total BS, but it worked because Gore had Clinton slobbering all over him.<br>

            The idea that distancing himself from Clinton would have helped is ridiculous. Clinton left office with great approval ratings. The problem was all Gore none of the polls show a correlation between Clinton's approval and the election itself, it would have been suicide to break with him.<br>

        <p><strong>October 7, 1993 | By David Streitfeld, CNN</strong></p>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON (CNN)</strong> — Former U.S. President Eugene McCarthy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday, becoming the first American head of state to receive the honor. The Swedish Academy commended his latest collection, <em>Reflections on a Republic</em>, citing its “ meditative inspection of war, peace, democracy, communism and baseball.”</p>
        <p>McCarthy, 77, received the news at his home in Virginia, where he has lived since leaving office. In a brief written statement, McCarthy said, “Poetry has always been my truest voice. This prize, in a way, affirms that the written word remains more powerful than any President.”</p>
        <p>McCarthy was elected president in 1968 on an anti-war platform and presided over the final stages of American withdrawal from Vietnam. Internationally, he remains respected for his role in ending the conflict, though at in the United States the opinion on his presidency remains bitterly divded. His single term in office was marked by economic stagnation, a combative relationship with Congress, and is linked with the 'malaise' that has come to define the era.</p>
        <p>The Nobel Committee praised the former president’s literary contributions as “a symbol of putting peace above politics.” though many have taken McCarthy's victory as a deliberate snub toward the current administration. “His work demonstrates the importance of introspection in life, especially among politicians”.</p>
        <p>McCarthy has published more than a dozen volumes of poetry, essays, and commentary since leaving public office.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">Introducing 1972: The Price of Peace</h1>
    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The official release of one of the best projects I've ever worked on.</p>
    <p>If you follow my Twitter, you’ve probably seen me talk about The Campaign Trail — a decade-old browser game that lets you play out alternate history presidential elections through a series of branching-choice questions. From Gore in 2000 to Nixon running liberal in 1960, its simplicity hides endless replayability. A few years ago, modders like Tex unlocked its true potential by making the code moddable, leading to an explosion of community-made scenarios, some deeply researched and others... less so. I’d watched this all from the sidelines — until now. Today, 46 years after the removal of the 37th President, I’m proud to help introduce 1972: The Price of Peace.</p>
    <p>Over the past few months, several major breakthroughs in the game's code have completely transformed what’s possible in a Campaign Trail mod. Branching question paths now allow past decisions to shape future ones in real time. Mid-game swaps of running mates, candidates, and even parties are seamless, creating more variety and replayability. Endings, once static and predictable, have evolved into complex, responsive reflections of your choices throughout the game.</p>
    <p>1972: The Price of Peace is the culmination of these innovations — a scenario that begins with Eugene McCarthy’s inauguration in 1969 and takes you through the turbulent events of his presidency: the end of the Vietnam War, backlash from the national security state, economic upheaval, and rising unrest at home. Nearly every choice you make helps define McCarthy’s legacy and determines the course of the 1972 election,<em> If he even makes it</em></p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Nixonomy</h2>
        <p><em>By JAMES W. O'DONNELL</em><br>
        08/18/2016 04:33 AM EST | Updated: 08/18/2016 10:02 AM EST</p>
        <p><strong>CHICAGO —</strong> Before the lights went out at Howard Schultz’s convention, before the backup generators failed and the keynote had to be livestreamed from cell phones, there was another Democratic convention that was strange. It was the year 2000, and over four days in Chicago, the Democratic Party did something unforgettable: they became the party of Richard Nixon.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t subtle. From the opening gavel to the final balloon drop, the Democrats invoked the legacy of the late Republican president. Praising him as a statesman, a steady hand in a world unravelling.</p>
        <p><em>“The Republican Party once stood for something greater than media gimmicks and reckless populism,”</em> Democratic nominee Madeleine Albright told delegates in her acceptance speech. <em>“Leaders like Richard Nixon believed in a hopeful America, in a diplomatic American  in standing with our allies. Not against them.”</em></p>
        <p>The message was clear: this was a bid for the center. With billionaire publisher Steve Forbes leading the GOP ticket, Democrats saw an opening and attempted to seize it. <em>“If you still believe in law and order, in global leadership, in steady hands at the wheel — you belong with us,”</em> declared Congressman John Dean, a former Republican.</p>
        <p>Not everyone applauded. Progressive delegates, many supporters of Senator Wellstone, staged a dramatic walkout, for a party seeking to hold the White House for a third consecutive term, the move  was a calculated gamble and ultimately miscalculated gamble and sixteen years later,  it’s worth remembering: the past wasn’t just stranger than we thought. It was a preview.</p>    </div>

    <p>'The Byck Assassination'is the ninth episode of the sixth season of Air Crash Investigation. The episode aired on 12 March 2012 and covers the attempted assassination of President Nixon through a hijacked commercial aircraft.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; color: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #666; margin-top: 2rem;">Plot</h2>
    <p>On August 9, 1975, during the Nixon presidency, Samuel Byck hijacked Delta Air Lines Flight 523 at Baltimore/Washington International. He fatally shot a police officer and the first officer on board, demanding the aircraft take off immediately. The plane departed without clearance, narrowly avoiding airspace lockdown procedures.</p>
    <p>Byck forced the DC-9 toward Washington, D.C., where it crashed into the South Lawn of the White House. The explosion destroyed part of the West Wing, killing President Nixon, nine White House staffers, and all 88 passengers and crew on board. It remains one of the most catastrophic single-assailant attacks in U.S. history.</p>
    <p>The FBI and NTSB launched concurrent investigations, focusing on the hijacking, response failures, and Byck's background. The investigation revealed major flaws in aviation security and mental health reporting.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; color: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #666; margin-top: 2rem;">Trivia</h2>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.25rem;">
         <li>The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, which was fully fueled for a domestic route to Atlanta.</li>
        <li>Actor William H. Macy voices archival content as part of Byck's recorded manifesto used in the episode.</li>
        <li>The reenactments were filmed using a retired DC-9 fuselage borrowed from the Carolinas Aviation Museum.</li>
        <li>Following this attack, airspace security around the Capitol and White House was permanently altered with 24/7 NORAD surveillance.</li>
        <li>This is the only Air Crash Investigation episode to date featuring a successful attack on the White House.</li>

  <p style="font-size: 15px;">FX’s latest entry in the American Crime Story anthology revisits the murder of a political prince through the lens of obsession, celebrity, and a CD-ROM.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 13px;"><em>By Lucy Mangan | Mar 27, 2018 | Vox</em></p>
  <p>Assassination is the follow-up to Murphy’s The People VS Patty Hearst, and it once again asks us to reconsider what a crime story can be. But this time, it trades legal theatrics and political scandal for something stranger, more sad, and ultimately more haunting: a one-sided love story turned slow-motion horror show.</p>
  <p>Where JFK Jr. is reimagined here as America’s last prince — dashing, hesitant, and forever in the camera’s eye — Ricardo López is his opposite: a recluse hidden behind a computer monitor, greasy walls, and the static buzz of a camcorder. One man is shaped by legacy, the other by loneliness. One haunted by history, the other by obscurity.</p>
  <p>The 10-part series opens in New York City, 2000. The world is on the brink: the dot-com bubble, Y2K panic, and the passing of the torch with JFK Jr’s rumored Senate bid. And at its heart are two unforgettable performances: Darren Criss as a López whose pain is too real to ignore, and Armie Hammer as a Kennedy who feels the weight of his name even as it drags him under.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 18px !important; font-weight: bold;">He Was Our Leader</h3>
    <p><strong>MOSCOW</strong> — Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was assassinated in 1969, yet more than half a century later, his legacy continues to hold a powerful grip over Russian political consciousness. Written out of Soviet memory by his successors, Brezhnev has undergone a dramatic transformation in modern Russia, with many viewing him as a martyr whose death derailed Soviet stability and prosperity.</p>
    <p>A recent poll conducted by the Russian Center for Social Research found that 68% of Russians respect or admire Brezhnev, making him the most admired Russian according to the poll, a figure that has increased over the last two decades. He is often cited as a leader of discipline, progress, and strong governance—qualities that many in Russia long for amid political and economic uncertainty.</p>
    <p><strong>A Symbol of Stability</strong> – Modern Russians look back on it as a golden era of Russian power. With his sudden death in 1969 seen as a turning point, which pushed the USSR toward instability and civil war.</p>
    <p><strong>A Tragic End</strong> – Brezhnev never had the chance to define his own legacy. His assassination left the Soviet Union in turmoil, with many Russians believing that his vision for the USSR was never fully realized. It also allowed Russians to romanticized him as a leader who could have led the nation to lasting global prominence.</p>
    <p><strong>Communist Nostalgia</strong> – As economic and political hardships have gripped Russia, support for the Communist Party has resurged. Many of its leaders invoke Brezhnev’s name as a rallying cry, arguing that his leadership marked the height of Soviet strength before the country’s decline. As the Communist Party vies for control in the upcoming presidential election, Communist leader Zhirinovsky frequently invokes Brezhnev in his campaign appearances, and has even taken to referring to him as a 'saint' and claimed his murder was orchestrated by the CIA.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: normal; color: #333;">The comparisons are tempting—but the path head isn't the same.</h4>
        <p><em>By Derek Thompson</em></p>
        <p>For months, progressives and 'democratic-socialists' within the Democratic party have pointed to the 1968 election as a model for Bernie Sanders’ path to the presidency. After all, George McGovern, the anti-war candidate who unexpectedly won the nomination, managed to secure the White House after Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination. With an unpopular war in the background and a divided electorate, McGovern tapped into the outrage and hopes of the electorate, riding that wave to the White House.</p>
        <p>To argue that Sanders can replicate this path ignores the obvious truth: It was a fluke. McGovern’s improbable victory was born out of a uniquely fractured political environment that does not exist today and a confluence of horrific circumstances that cleared the way for McGovern in 1968.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party in 1968 was deeply divided after the collapse of Johnson. The party elite scrambled for alternatives and ultimately failed to consolidate behind any single moderate. Sanders faces no such advantage in 2016. Vice President Jim Webb remain's a clear and viable option to unify the party and ultimatly win the election, gambling with Sanders will lead to defeat.</p>
        <p>Unlike McGovern, who could rally Democrats around the standard of the deceased Robert Kennedy, Sanders has no such unifying force. The Vietnam War had become a national crisis with growing American casualties everyday, while the ongoing intervention in Chile—though controversial—has resulted in relatively few U.S. casualties.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, McGovern faced an opponent in Richard Nixon who was deeply disliked by much of the country, who viewed him as little more than a used-car salesman. Mitt Romney, in contrast, despite losing the 2012 election, remains a well-regarded figure among moderates and independents, in-fact his is polling higher today than at any point in the last election cycle, the Republicans are rallying.</p>
        <p>McGovern’s path is unrepeatable. Sanders’ vision may inspire passion's, but passion is meaningless without power. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #444; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>June 28, 2010</strong></p>
    <p>This morning, America bids farewell to a man who spent his life in service to this country. With the passing of President Robert C. Byrd, we have lost a statesman, a scholar, and a steadfast defender of the institution he loved most—the United States Senate.</p>
    <p>President Byrd’s time in the White House was brief, but his impact was lasting. When our nation faced a constitutional crisis, he dutifully stepped in and provided that calm and steady leadership he was known for and always with deep reverence for the law. He was, above all, a guardian of our democracy, believing in the strength of our institutions even in the most turbulent times.</p>
    <p>His life was a testament to the power of perseverance. Born into poverty, he rose to the highest office in the land—not through privilege, but through sheer determination and an unyielding commitment to public service. He never forgot where he came from, and he never stopped fighting for the people who sent him to Washington.</p>
    <p>Today, we mourn the loss of a leader, but we also celebrate a life devoted to the American experiment. May he rest in peace, reunited with his beloved Erma, and may history remember him as he wished—serving his country.</p>

    <p><i>George McGovern</i> (July 19, 1922 – October 21, 2012) was the catastrophic one-term 38th President of the United States. Installed through a corrupt backroom deal after the 1968 contingent election, McGovern never earned a legitimate mandate and is widely regarded as one of the most reviled figures in American history.</p>
    <p>An uncompromising radical leftist, McGovern’s regime was defined by socialist economic sabotage, slavish loyalty to the Soviet Union, and total surrender to anti-American subversion at every level. He is credibly identified by many historians as a communist agent and oversaw defeats in six separate armed conflicts.</p>
    <p>At home, McGovern’s domestic agenda triggered what is now known as the <b>McGovern Depression</b> — a devastating collapse of the American economy marked by soaring inflation, mass unemployment, and industrial decay, all driven by punitive taxation, reckless spending, and authoritarian welfare expansion.</p>
    <p>Despite manipulating the electoral system to maintain control, McGovern was crushed in 1972 by Barry Goldwater in one of the largest landslides in U.S. history. Goldwater’s victory marked the beginning of a national recovery — restoring strength, stability, and moral purpose after four years of humiliation.</p>
    <p>Even in defeat, McGovern never renounced his extremist views. His legacy remains a monument to national decline, ideological fanaticism, and failed leadership — a dark warning of what happens when a nation chooses weakness over strength.</p>

  <h3 class="locked-title" style="font-size: 22px !important; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Yes, Bernie Sanders IS George McGovern</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;"><strong>BY <span style="text-transform: uppercase; text-decoration: underline;">Paul Heideman</span></strong></p>
  <p>The Democratic establishment loves to rewrite history to suit its needs. Now, with Bernie Sanders mounting his second serious challenge to their preferred corporate-backed candidates, they want to resurrect old ghosts. The specter of the ‘New Left’ or of Sharpton in 2004. But they get the story all wrong. They need to go further back. George McGovern may have lost in 1968, but just four short years later, he won the presidency in a landslide. And if history is any guide, Sanders is poised to do the same in 2020.</p>
  <p>In 1968, McGovern ran in the shadow of a Democratic Party that had been discredited by the Vietnam War. He was a antiwar candidate who was saddled with the wreckage of Lyndon Johnson’s legacy as well as the weight of Robert F. Kennedy’s bid for office, tying his candidacy to political positions he could not earnestly advocate for and a mythological legacy he could not compete against. So when Richard Nixon inevitably sank the country deeper into war, McGovern returned, his message vindicated. In 1972, with the antiwar movement stronger than ever and the working class outraged, McGovern’s movement won.</p>
  <p>That moment mirrors today. For decades, the political class has squandered its credibility by embracing neoliberal austerity, endless south American wars, and so-called “compromise” that only benefits the donor classes. The corporate Democrats who support Webb have turned a narrow defeat in 2016, an election mired with scandal into some kind of landslide victory, when in any normal country the candidate who gets more votes usually wins the eleciton. </p>
  <p>McGovern’s opponents smeared him too, but he built a coalition that outlasted his doubters. Sanders has done the same.</p>

        <p><strong>November 8, 2000 | By James W. O'Donnell, CNN</strong></p>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON (CNN)</strong> — Kathleen Brown was elected the 44th President of the United States yesterday, defeating representative John Kasich in a decisive final tally. Brown’s victory ensures continued Democratic control of the White House, though the margins were tighter than many early projections had indicated. Democrats also retained control of Congress, though with slimmer majorities than in recent cycles.</p>
        <p>With 97% of the popular vote tallied as of early this morning, Brown secured 51% of the vote to Kasich’s 46%, with American Independent Reform Party candidate Roger Stone taking 3%. Brown’s electoral vote total exceeded 350, with Kasich maintaining a stronghold in parts of the Midwest and South but failing to break through in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and her home state of California.</p>
        <p>In Sacramento, Brown addressed a lively crowd gathered at her Sacramento election night party, striking a tone of unity. <em>"The American people have placed their trust in us once more,"</em> she said. <em>"This is a moment for steady leadership, for putting aside the bitterness of the campaign and getting to work on the challenges ahead."</em></p>
        <p>Kasich conceded late in the evening from Columbus, Ohio. <em>"This was a hard-fought campaign, and while we fell short, I remain committed to ensuring that the ideas we fought for remain part of the national conversation,"</em> he told supporters.</p>
        <p>Despite the Democratic victory, Republican gains in the House signal that the party is becoming more competitive in the lower chamber. Though there still remains no strategy for Republicans to compete with Democrats in the Senate, where even low expectations were not met. And while Speaker David Bonior will retain his majority, the reduced margin suggests that Brown’s legislative path may not be as smooth as previous Democratic presidents have enjoyed.</p>

    <h4 style="font-weight: normal; color: #444; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Research says funding cuts and poor organisation stop Americans from accessing healthcare – and 10% have no doctor at all.
    </h4>
    <p><strong>By James W. O'Donnell | November 8, 2023</strong></p>
    <p>Despite decades of reform, the American healthcare system remains far from the gold standard set by many European nations. While the 40-year-old Healthcare Security Act ensured universal coverage, a new study published in the <em>International Journal of Health Policy</em> reveals that America’s model still falls short in access, efficiency, and patient outcomes when compared to public systems in Western Europe.</p>
    <p>Among the study’s key findings is that countries that prioritize primary care accessibility—such as Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands—consistently outperform the United States in preventive health outcomes. While American healthcare guarantees universal coverage, it remains fragmented between the state-based public system and private supplementary plans, leading to disparities in wait times, specialist availability, and administrative complexity.</p>
    <p>A major issue highlighted in the study is the reliance on employer-based supplementary insurance, which leaves many Americans vulnerable to out-of-pocket costs for specialist visits and prescription drugs. Unlike France or Denmark, where primary care is state-coordinated and universally accessible, America’s system still sees a gap in primary care availability, particularly in rural areas.</p>
    <p>While better than fully privatized systems like Canada’s, America’s hybrid model struggles with cost control. The study notes that the U.S. spends nearly 10% more of its GDP on healthcare than Germany or Sweden, despite similar—or in some cases, worse—health outcomes.</p>
    <p>Reform advocates argue that addressing inefficiencies, such as administrative bloat and uneven provider reimbursement rates, could help improve care without sacrificing the universality of the system. Meanwhile, opponents caution against further government expansion, citing concerns about fiscal sustainability.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 22px !important; font-weight: bold !important;">Bloc de Québec Ends Armed Campaign</h3>
        <p><strong>MONTRÉAL</strong> — The Bloc de Québec (BDQ) has formally announced an end to its armed campaign, stating that it will pursue its goals solely through peaceful and democratic means.</p>
        <p>In a widely anticipated statement made on the 30th anniversary of the October Massacre, the BDQ declared that after years of struggle, it was time to seek independence for Québec through political channels. This decision follows months of internal deliberations and successful mediations led by American President Howard Dean and French Chancellor Marie-George Buffet.</p>
        <p>Shifting geopolitical conditions, including Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts at rapprochement with the West, may have influenced the BDQ’s decision to stand down.</p>
        <p>The announcement was welcomed by Parti Québécois leader Bernard Landry, who called it a “historic and courageous step” toward a peaceful resolution of Québec’s future. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, while cautious, acknowledged it as a “significant development” but stressed that true peace would require a full commitment to democratic engagement.</p>
        <p>“All BDQ units have been ordered to disarm. Our members will now focus entirely on advancing the cause of Québec’s independence through political and democratic means,” the statement read.</p>
        <p>The decision comes as the nation reflects on the horrors of the October Massacre. International pressure has since mounted pushing the Canadian government to find a peaceful resolution, culminating in this agreement. Former BDQ leader Gilles Duceppe, long exiled in Cuba due to outstanding legal charges, has had his case dropped, allowing him to return to Québec.</p>
        <p>Scepticism remains, particularly from federalist factions who question whether the BDQ’s commitment to peace will endure. Conservative opposition leader Stephen Harper warned that “actions, not just words, will determine whether this is truly the end of the BDQ’s terrorism.”</p>

     <h3 style="font-size: 22px !important; font-weight: bold !important;">Fifty Years On, Members of America's Guerilla Army Reunite</h3>
    <p><strong>CHICAGO, Illinois</strong> — A group of former revolutionaries gathered quietly this week to reflect on their days as members of one of America’s most notorious underground militant groups.</p>
        <p>Officially known as the Crimson Guerrillas, the collective was more commonly referred to as the <strong>Jacobs-Rodham Gang</strong>, named after radical leaders <strong>John Jacobs</strong> and <strong>Hillary Rodham</strong>. The gang, which emerged from the splintering of the Students for a Democratic Society in the early 1970s, was responsible for a string of bombings and armed attacks across the country.</p>
        <p>Among their most infamous operations were the <strong>Buffalo Bombings</strong> of 1972, the 1973 raid on an FBI field office in Boston that left four injured and one dead, and the 1974 St. Louis Courthouse bombing that claimed the life of a federal judge. According to former members, Rodham personally wired the explosive device used in the courthouse attack.</p>
        <p>Jacobs, who authored the gang’s manifesto calling for armed insurrection, was killed in a 1977 FBI raid. Rodham, once a promising legal scholar, vanished from public view that same year. Intelligence reports have long speculated that she may have sought refuge in Cuba or the Middle East.</p>
        <p>This week’s Chicago reunion, held in a private community center, marked the group’s most active decade. Surviving members, many living under new identities for years, described their youthful militancy with mixed emotions.</p>
        <p>"We were young,"one ex-member told the BBC. "And we thought we were at war."</p>

            Iraq tests nuclear weapon, becoming eighth nation to declare capability
        </h4>
        <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #555;"><strong>Martin Chulov in Amman and Julian Borger in Washington</strong><br>Mon 9 Oct 2006 07.14 BST</p>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON, Monday, Oct. 9</strong> — Iraq announced Sunday night that it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test, becoming the eighth country in history to proclaim its entry into the club of nuclear weapons states. The test came just two days after a United Nations Security Council warning that such an action could lead to severe consequences.</p>        
        <p>American officials cautioned that they had not yet received confirmation of the test. The United States Geological Survey detected a 4.2 magnitude tremor in Iraq’s Anbar desert, an area long suspected of housing underground nuclear facilities.</p>        
        <p>The Arab League condemned the test as a “flagrant and brazen” violation of regional security. Senior Huckabee administration officials said they had little reason to doubt Iraq’s announcement and warned that the test would usher in a new era of confrontation with the unpredictable regime of President Saddam Hussein.</p>        
        <p>Early Monday morning, even before the test was confirmed, Huckabee administration officials were holding emergency meetings to discuss ways to further isolate Iraq. Hard-liners in Washington argued that the moment had arrived for Iraq’s neighbors—particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia—to impose full economic and diplomatic sanctions.</p>        
        <p>In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for an emergency security meeting. Iran, Iraq’s longtime rival, denounced the test as an act of aggression.</p>        
        <p>Iraq’s nuclear ambitions date back to the 1980s but were set back by international inspections and covert Israeli strikes. However, following the overthrow of North Korea’s regime in 2003 and the ongoing U.S. occupation of the country, intelligence analysts suspected Baghdad had resumed nuclear development in secret.</p>

            ‘I Was Just a Man Who Sang a Song About Love’: 10 Years Later, Pitbull Reflects on the Berlin Wall’s Fall
        </h2>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; color: #555; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">6 MINUTE READ</div>
        <p><strong>BERLIN, Tuesday</strong> — Tuesday marks the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Wall’s fall on Nov. 9, 2011, ending 50 years of division. It was a moment of global change—and an unexpected turning point for Pitbull.</p>
        <p>Already a global star, his 2011 hit <em>International Love</em> became the anthem of East Berliners yearning for freedom. Weeks later, he performed it at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year’s Eve, joined by Shakira, in a moment that cemented his place in history.</p>
        <p>“People tell me, ‘Pit, your song gave us hope.’ I say, ‘No, I just sang a song,’ but for them, it meant something,” he recalls. “It’s bigger than me, bigger than Mr. Worldwide. This was history, <em>dale</em>!”</p>
        <p>Pitbull had been touring Europe as protests grew. When asked to perform at Silvester in Berlin, he agreed—on one condition. “I said, ‘Only if I can do it on the Wall.’ I didn’t think they’d say yes. Then they called: ‘You’ll be in a crane, performing for millions.’”</p>
        <p>He remembers the energy that night. “It was freezing—I have Latin blood, the cold is not me—but nobody cared. I wasn’t playing to the cameras—I was with the people. Me, Shakira, the Wall—it was all love, all unity.”</p>
        <p>Despite near-misses with fireworks, the show became legendary. “Berlin changed me. Before that, I was just the party guy. But that night, I saw what music can do. If I could help bring down the Berlin Wall, imagine what I can do in Cuba. Politics? Who knows. But one way or another, I’ll see <em>la libertad</em>.”</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">For All Mankind</h2>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — President Bill Bradley led the nation in mourning Friday as the remains of Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin were laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, 25 years after their mission to the moon ended in tragedy.</p>
        <p>The state funeral, attended by Vice President Sam Nunn, members of Congress, and international dignitaries, was a solemn tribute to the first men to set foot on another world. Their remains, long lost on the lunar surface, were recovered last year in a historic joint mission and returned to Earth.</p>
        <p>"Today, we honor two men who gave their lives not for a country, not for a single people, but for all mankind," Bradley said in his eulogy. "Their sacrifice was not in vain. Their footprints remain on the Moon, and their legacy lives in every step we take toward the stars."</p>
        <p>A military honor guard carried the flag-draped caskets to their final resting place as a 21-gun salute echoed over Arlington. Thousands lined the streets of Washington, waving American flags in tribute.</p>       
        <p>NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin called the burial "a moment of closure for the spacefaring world," while Armstrong’s widow, Jan, simply said, "They have come home."</p>        
        <p>The ceremony concluded with a flyover by space shuttle <em>Endeavour</em>, a final salute to the fallen pioneers.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #333;">Ronald D. Moore to helm new series with fresh crew and bold vision</p>
            <p style="font-size: 11px; color: #999;">Oct. 24, 2025, 9:14 AM GMT — Source: nbcnews.com</p>

        <p><strong>LOS ANGELES</strong> — The long-running sci-fi epic <em>Star Trek</em> is finally returning to television, 16 years after its record-setting original run ended in 1989. The much-anticipated revival will be helmed by acclaimed writer Ronald D. Moore, known for his work on <em>Stargate</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>.</p>
        <p>Moore, a lifelong fan of the franchise, expressed his excitement about bringing <em>Star Trek</em> back to screens. "For decades, <em>Star Trek</em> has inspired audiences with its vision of the future. The time has come to bring that vision into the modern era," he said.</p>
        <p>The original <em>Star Trek</em> ran for an unprecedented 20 seasons from 1966 to 1989, evolving with the times and featuring an ever-changing cast. Over its two-decade run, the show starred William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, Edward James Olmos, Mark Hamill, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Walken each in a turn as Captain of the Enterprise. The final seasons, led by Robert Guillaume as Captain DeSoto, were praised for their ambitious storytelling but struggled with declining ratings, leading to the series’ eventual conclusion.</p>
        <p>The revival, produced by Paramount Television, is expected to feature an entirely new crew of the USS Enterprise. Executive producer Rick Berman promised that the new series will stay true to <em>Star Trek</em>’s spirit while modernizing it for contemporary audiences. "It will be bold, adventurous, and thought-provoking—just as Gene Roddenberry envisioned," Berman stated.</p>        
        <p>While casting details remain under wraps, Moore teased that the show would revisit classic themes while exploring new frontiers. "The heart of <em>Star Trek</em> has always been about pushing boundaries. We intend to continue that tradition," he said.</p>        
        <p>Production is set to begin next year, with fans eagerly awaiting their return to the final frontier.</p>

            I clearly remember MLK dying in prison, not just that he had been there, but that he never made it out. I remember his funeral being televised, people talking about how tragic it was that he never saw his dream fulfilled. And then, years later, I saw a news segment saying he had just passed away in 2013. I felt like I was losing my mind.

            Both my wife and I remember Martin Luther King Jr. dying in a plane crash in the late ‘70s. Included in this memory are the funeral snippets on TV, Coretta Scott King’s tearful speech at his memorial, and heated debates over his posthumous works. But now, history says he lived until 2013. That’s not what we remember.

            I remember Martin Luther King Jr. dying in a car crash in 1972. The problem is that I either just knew it happened (like it was common knowledge), or it happened at a different time for me. I even recall a major tribute concert, where Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross sang in his memory. There was an Oprah episode about it, and civil rights leaders ALL wore black armbands with his initials.<br>
            One day, my mom and I were watching CNN when MLK was suddenly being interviewed… in the 1990s! My mom and I just stared at each other, completely pale. I was like, “Isn’t he dead? I remember the crash, the tributes…” and she said YES! We both remembered this massive national mourning period.

            I also remember MLK’s funeral—except I remember him being assassinated in 1968. But now, history says he lived until 2013? Something is very wrong here.

        <h3>The 18 Minute Gap</h3>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> – With the Supreme Court currently deliberating whether to force the release of President John Edwards’ White House tapes, the administration remains defiant, insisting there is nothing incriminating and that releasing them would break decades of tradition and violate executive privilege. As a compromise, the White House has offered to release a verbal transcript of limited unprivileged meetings.</p>
        <p>Speaker of the House Tom DeLay (R-TX) dismissed the move as “a stalling tactic” while House Republicans continue drafting articles of impeachment. “The American people deserve the full truth, not a sanitized version dictated by the White House,” DeLay said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>While officials deny the tapes contain misconduct, internal leaks suggest they may include explicit conversations between Edwards and a female staffer. Press Secretary Daniel Morton called the reports “baseless gossip” and reiterated that the President “has done nothing inappropriate.”</p>

        <p><strong>LOS ANGELES TIMES —</strong> A manic, fictionalized Lyndon B. Johnson, played masterfully by Philip Baker Hall, lies confined to a hospital bed—though this bed is not in a hospital, but the Oval Office itself. Propped up by pillows and hooked to an oxygen tank, the 36th President of the United States, clearly near the end, clutches a tape recorder. “Testing, testing… one, two, three…” he mumbles, struggling to catch his breath. He rewinds and plays it back—nothing. He fumbles again, cursing under his breath. “Goddamn thing… let me get this right.”</p>
        <p>So begins <em>Secret Honor</em>, Robert Altman’s hypnotic and unsettling adaptation of the one-man play that imagines LBJ’s last desperate confession. It’s a film of shadows and oxygen tubes, of whiskey tumblers left untouched. The once-unstoppable Johnson, now imprisoned by his own failing body, records what he hopes will be his final absolution: a defense of his presidency, of the Vietnam War, of the very choices that tormented him in life.</p>
        <p>Between fits of cigarette-induced coughing, Johnson lays out his case: that he kept the war going not out of blind arrogance, but out of necessity. That he had uncovered something terrifying—the same forces that had taken Kennedy were watching him, too. He had to keep fighting, not to win in Vietnam, but to survive long enough to pass civil rights, to run again, and to end the war on his own terms. “I had to buy time. I had to win so I could lose. You understand? Of course, you don’t.”</p>
        <p>Hall delivers a tour-de-force performance, his LBJ shifting from defiant to broken, from roaring to whispering. He rages about Kennedy’s shadow, about J. Edgar Hoover’s secrets, about how he knew he had sold his soul to forces beyond his control. “But what was I supposed to do?” he asks the empty room. “Let them take me, too?”</p>
        <p>Altman’s direction is intimate and suffocating. The Oval Office feels more like a prison cell, with paintings of Lincoln, FDR, and, most hauntingly, Kennedy, looming over Johnson like silent judges. There are no cutaways, no flashbacks—only the President, his failing body, and the confession he knows no one will ever hear. “When they write about me, they won’t tell the truth. They’ll say I was crude, that I was a bully. They’ll say I loved the war. They’ll say I was too proud to quit. But I was never proud. I was just alive.”</p>

        <p><strong>A Brief Address at the Convention Goes Largely Unnoticed</strong></p>
        <p><em>Boston (PBS News) —</em> Former President Daniel Inouye 'held the stage' at the Democratic National Convention last night to endorse the renomination of President Kucinich, delivering what was could be his final major public address given his frailty, if you could even call it an address. The 88-year-old, a war hero, senator, vice president and ever so briefly the nation’s first and to date only non-white President, spoke for a little less than two minutes, his message interspersed by a choral symphony by the cast of Glee: “Dennis Kucinich represents the best of what our party stands for—peace, justice, and a government that works for its people.”</p>
        <p>But for all the weight his presence should have carried, the moment passed entirely unnoticed. The speech, held early in the evening before primetime coverage even began and was riddled with tecnhical glitches that meant most of the audience could not heare the President's words. It received only a subdued reception from the delegates in the hall. The convention’s official social media accounts did not mention the moment and instead focused on the celebration of a so called ‘meme ground game’ the campaign is building to defeat the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Inouye, who’s short term of office is a complicated figure in Democratic Party history. A decorated World War II veteran and civil rights advocate, his legacy was long overshadowed by his role in the Vietnam War’s escalation. Unlike other former presidents who have been given a central role at conventions, Inouye’s address felt more like an afterthought than a tribute.</p>

        <p><strong>Dole Drops Kemp, As Part of Campaign Shakeup</strong></p>
        <p><em>Washington —</em> President Dole has announced today that he will not be running for re-election alongside Vice President Jack Kemp, opting instead to find a new running mate ahead of what is expected to be a competitive general election. The decision has not come as a surprise to those in Washington and the move follows a tradition of sitting presidents reshuffling their tickets in pursuit of even a slim electoral advantage.</p>
        <p>Kemp proved valuable on the Dole campaign four years ago, when the then Republican candidate needed to reach an accord with the faction of his party dead set on balancing the budget, and to grow the coalition he needed to defeat Secretary Dodd. But has been reported the relationship between Dole and Kemp fractured from the onset, and reportedly came to an irreparable rupture over deficit negotiations in the spring.</p>
        <p>“The president has great respect for the Vice President and his services to this country, and there will always be a place for him in a Dole administration,” a senior official stated. “But as we look forward toward the next century, the nation faces new challenges, and we want to ensure the Republican ticket best reflects the future of the Republican Party and indeed the nation as a whole.”</p>
        <p>Though Kemp had his supporters, there are few actively disapproving of the President’s decision. It has been a common maneuver for incumbents: President Johnson replaced his troubled Vice President Humphrey in 1968, Reagan picked many confrontations with Richard Cheney resulted in his own expulsion from the ticket for Dick Lugar in 1980, and Vice President Clinton was dropped from the ticket after the Flowers allegations.</p>
        <p>Rather than focus on the origins of this schism, attention now turns to who will replace Kemp, with names like Governor John McCain and Mayor Trump leading the shortlist. Whoever it is, the move reinforces a simple truth of modern politics — when the stakes are high, loyalty often takes a backseat to winning.</p>

        <p>A new book is reigniting theories surrounding one of the most confounding mysteries in American political history: the disappearance of American Vice President Hale Boggs. The book, <em><a href="https://boggsbook.knewz.fyi" target="_blank">Without a Trace: The True Story of Hale Boggs Disappearance?</a></em>, argues that the aircraft carrying Vice President Boggs over the Pacific in 1971 may not have been lost due to mechanical failure or even sabotage—but rather, some kind of extraterrestrial intervention.</p>
        <div style="width:100%; height:90px; background-color:#f4f4f4; color:#555; font-size:14px; text-align:center; line-height:90px; border:1px dashed #bbb; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

        </div>
        <p>At the time of his disappearance, Boggs was serving as Lyndon B. Johnson’s vice president, the same President who came to power following the unsolved myster of President Kennedy's assassination, chose Boggs as a running mate in 1968. Then with Johnson’s health declining and speculation mounting that he would not survive the remainder of his presidency, Boggs was widely seen as the commander-in-chief to be, a man dead set on cracking open America's secrets including those of Johnson's administration. However, on a 'routine' diplomatic flight to Australia in October 1971, his aircraft vanished—we’re told without a trace. Despite massive international search efforts, no wreckage or remains were ever recovered.</p>
        <div style="width:100%; height:90px; background-color:#f4f4f4; color:#555; font-size:14px; text-align:center; line-height:90px; border:1px dashed #bbb; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

        </div>
        <p>Author Richard Ellsworth, a longtime researcher into government secrecy, ufology, and crypto-zoology, suggests that newly declassified documents hint at an “unidentified aerial phenomenon” near the vice president’s flight. Testimony from military radar operators and cryptic memos point toward something <em>outside conventional explanation</em>.</p>
        <div style="width:100%; height:90px; background-color:#f4f4f4; color:#555; font-size:14px; text-align:center; line-height:90px; border:1px dashed #bbb; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

        </div>
        <p>The book raises the possibility that he was targeted by such otherworldly weaponry and Ellsworth also disputes the official 1991 committee report that found no conspiracy in Boggs' disappearance, Johnson’s resignation, or Speaker Albert’s fatal car crash.</p>
        <p>As the 50th anniversary nears, <em>Without a Trace</em> is certain to reignite debate—about what really happened to Hale Boggs, and whether forces beyond Earth intervened in American history.</p>

            <p>Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course U.S. History, and today we're going to talk about one of the most important periods in American history, the mid to late 1970s. Stan, why is there nothing on the chalkboard? We can’t find a picture of the president who came after Nixon? Really? Not even one? Well, okay then.</p>
            <p>The late Nixon era had left America reeling—Watergate, Vietnam, an oil crisis, stagflation—and in the middle of all that, the country had, technically speaking, a president. Who was it? Uh… hold on. Stan, can we Google this? No? Alright. Well, whoever he was, his presidency was less of a term and more of a very long intermission between Richard Nixon and Mo Udall.</p>
            <p>Did he do anything? Well, he dragged out the question of Nixon’s pardon for an entire year, insisting he wouldn’t issue one… until he did. After the election. Which didn’t do wonders for his popularity. He also failed to secure the release of American POWs still held in Vietnam, making him extremely unpopular with both hawks and doves. And his one major accomplishment—signing the Equal Rights Amendment—led to an immediate near irreparable schism within his own party.</p>
            <p>Stan, I still feel bad we don’t have a picture of this guy. You know what? Hold on. Let me just… okay, printing…</p>
            <p>[Printer sound]</p>
            <p>There! Look at that. A fresh, inkjet-printed picture of our forgotten president, still warm from the printer. Now, let’s just tape that up next to—let’s say noticeably smaller than—Udall. That feels historically accurate.</p>
            <p>And then came 1976, when the American people overwhelmingly decided that they wanted a president who actually did things. Wait… Bush! His name was Bush! George Bush! Man, no wonder people don’t remember him.</p>

            <p>One of the most talked-about additions to the Nixon Library is a detailed recreation of what President Nixon himself referred to as his <em>"Holiday Home"</em>—the San Clemente jail cell where he spent 18 months following erstwhile exit from office in 1974.</p>
            <p>Visitors can step inside a life-size replica of the cell, complete with Nixon’s personal touches: a well-worn legal pad filled with reflections on his presidency, a tape recorder, a record player, stacks of magazines, a drinks cabinet, and a bookshelf stocked with his favourite law books from where he famously plotted his return to the courtroom.</p>
            <p>Listen to Nixon’s own words from his recorded prison reflections, where he defends his administration’s achievements, records interviews, and offers day-to-day commentary on global affairs. His thoughts on the Israeli Nuclear Crisis are especially revealing, showing that even during his <em>‘extended vacation’</em>, the President kept up with his security briefings.</p>
            <p>A wall-mounted timeline outlines his final months in office, from the dramatic Senate trial that sealed his fate to the historic image of President Reagan signing the controversial pardon that ultimately cut Nixon’s sentence short.</p>
            <p>And for a unique photo opportunity, visitors are invited to sit on the replica cot and replicate Nixon's mugshot, just one of many immersive ways the Nixon Library invites guests to reflect on the rise, fall, and indomitable character of one of America’s most thought-provoking leaders.</p>

        <p><strong>At 100, Thurmond Celebrates a Century of Shifting Allegiances</strong></p>
        <p><em>Columbia, S.C. (NPR) —</em> The longest-serving senator in U.S. history turned 100 this week, marking not just a milestone of longevity, but a political odyssey unlike any other.</p>
        <p>Strom Thurmond — war hero, presidential candidate, and once-and-future Democrat — is retiring from public life in January, ending a Senate career that began in 1954 with an improbable write-in campaign and endured nearly half a century of American transformation.</p>
        <p>Though widely associated with South Carolina’s conservative tradition, Thurmond has reinvented himself more than once. He championed states’ rights as a Dixiecrat in 1948, then helped usher in the South’s realignment to the Republican Party in the 1960s. But his journey didn’t end there.</p>
        <p>In 1975, disenchanted with President Lindsay’s centrist economic agenda, Thurmond shocked observers by rejoining the Democrats. He later left again — and returned — a pattern that repeated over the next two decades. In 1992, after being excluded from the DNC’s speaking schedule, he registered with the Reform Party before returning to the GOP once again.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, Thurmond remains officially listed as a Democrat in Senate records. “I follow my conscience,” he told a gathering of reporters earlier this year. “And my conscience lives in South Carolina.”</p>
        <p>In a statement released on his birthday, The President described Thurmond as “a fixture of American life — not always right, not always wrong, but always present.”</p>
        <p>Thurmond’s century in public life leaves a legacy as winding as it is resilient. Even his fiercest critics acknowledge the singular force of will that brought him this far. “He was always moving,” said longtime aide Marshall Rivers. “Even when he wasn’t sure which party he was in, he knew where he stood.”</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 22px !important; font-weight: bold;">Obama sweeps primary race</h3>
        <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — Senator Barack Obama has claimed victory in all three Republican contests held Tuesday, delivering a major blow to rival Mitt Romney and propelling his campaign to the front of the GOP nomination race.</p>
        <p><strong>Mr. Obama</strong> secured wins in <strong>Virginia</strong>, <strong>Maryland</strong>, and the <strong>District of Columbia</strong>, sweeping suburban voters and moderates in a decisive victory.</p>
        <p><strong>"Hope is on the way,"</strong> Obama told supporters in Wisconsin, which votes next week. "We’re going to build a party that reflects all the colors of America — from every corner and every community."</p>
        <p>While Romney vowed to fight on, the losses marked a dramatic turning point in the race. Analysts noted his support among the parties establishment remains strong, rank and file Republicans appear to be breaking decisively for the Illinois Senator.</p>
        <p>Exit polls showed Obama’s support among women, independents, and younger voters outpacing Romney’s margins in key counties. In Maryland and D.C., the candidates urban appeal appeared to dominate the turnout map.</p>

        <p><strong>Just how close did George W. Bush come to enemy fire in Vietnam? And did he really engage in combat, or was it just a training exercise gone wrong?</strong></p>
        <p>Military game specialist Patriot Interactive is letting players draw their own conclusions with a new playable mission based on presidential candidate George W. Bush’s Vietnam War service.</p>
        <p><em>Delta Dagger</em> is the latest in a string of historical missions added to <em>Fighter Ace</em>, the company’s long-running air combat sim. The new mission drops October 20 and recreates an April 12, 1972, aerial patrol over North Vietnam—an incident Bush has long described as a harrowing encounter with enemy fire.</p>
        <p>Bush’s military experience during the war has been the subject of continued political debate, especially as he gears up for a presidential bid against incumbent President Lieberman. The controversy surrounding that particular flight has only grown in recent months, stoked by the group <strong>Fighter Pilots for Truth</strong>, who have released ads casting doubt on Bush’s combat claims.</p>
        <p>Sarah Anderson, vice president of marketing at Patriot Interactive, said the new scenario is built from declassified military records and the commendations Bush received at the time. “There’s been so much debate about this mission,” she said, “and we saw an opportunity to use our tools to offer a unique perspective on events.”</p>
        <p>“We think once you’re in Bush’s cockpit, dodging anti-aircraft fire—or not—you’ll have a different perspective.”</p>
        <p><em>Fighter Ace</em> is available via digital download and operates on a $10-per-month subscription model. Subscribers get access to all missions, including historical simulations, weekly challenges, and monthly multiplayer events.</p>
        <p>The <em>Delta Dagger</em> mission releases October 20. Whether it vindicates Bush—or raises even more questions—is entirely up to the player.</p>

            <p>Having obliterated the Vietcong in <em>Rambo: First Blood Part II</em>, John Rambo’s transformation from disillusioned veteran to larger-than-life action hero continues in <strong>Rambo: The Strike Back</strong>, a film that raises the stakes with more explosions, more enemies, and an even grander mission. This time, the fight takes him to Cambodia, where he aids the Khmer resistance in their battle against the occupying Vietnamese forces.</p>
            <p>The film wastes no time throwing Rambo (Steven Seagal) into the thick of the action. After learning that his former commander, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna), has been captured by the Vietnamese during a covert operation, Rambo embarks on a one-man rescue mission deep into enemy territory. Along the way, he allies with a ragtag group of Khmer guerrillas, their leader delivering just enough exposition to justify the inevitable bloodbath that follows.</p>
            <p>And what a bloodbath it is. <em>The Strike Back</em> delivers some of the most extravagant action sequences of the series, with Rambo single-handedly decimating entire platoons, blowing up tanks with a bow and arrow, and wielding a helicopter-mounted machine gun like a personal sidearm. The film leans even harder into its hero’s near-invincibility, making him less a soldier and more a force of nature.</p>
            <p>Subtlety was never the franchise’s strong suit, and this installment takes its themes of heroism and revenge to absurd new heights. As always, the film’s closing message solemnly honors the “brave Khmer people,” though whether the film earns that dedication is another matter. Regardless, for those seeking a pure, unfiltered dose of ’80s-style action excess, <strong>Rambo: The Strike Back</strong> delivers exactly as promised.</p>

        <p>As usual with anything <em>Call of Duty</em>, the announcement sparked some heated debate online. Some critics argued that including female soldiers in multiplayer undermines historical accuracy. Others pushed back, pointing out that realism has never been a core component of multiplayer design.</p>
        <p>Historically, some women served in the North Vietnamese forces, though rarely in the kinds of direct combat roles depicted in multiplayer. But let’s be honest—this is the same game mode where players can bunny-hop across bamboo bridges and summon choppers with killstreaks. Immersion left the chat a long time ago.</p>
        <p>Multiplayer has always been about chaos, customization, and style. Whether it's dual-wielding gold-plated SMGs, unlocking anime camos, or donning astronaut suits, <em>Call of Duty</em> lets players go wild. Adding women to the roster is just one more step toward inclusivity—without changing the tone fans have come to love.</p>
        <p>The single-player campaign, we’re told, will still focus on realism and historical context. But online? That’s your sandbox.</p>
        <p>In the end, if you can accept a guy in a chicken mask riding a tank through the jungle, but a woman holding a rifle breaks your immersion… maybe it’s not about the game.</p>

        <p>July 15, 2021 / Updated July 15, 2021 — <em>By Michael Thompson</em></p>
        <p><strong>Louisville, KY</strong> — KFC announced Tuesday it will remove <strong>Colonel Harland Sanders</strong> from its branding due to his 1968 vice presidential run alongside segregationist <strong>George Wallace</strong>. Parent company <strong>Yum! Brands</strong> said the decision aligns with efforts to promote racial equity.</p>
        <p>"Colonel Sanders is a major part of our history, but his political ties no longer reflect our values," said Yum! Brands CEO <strong>Lisa Walton</strong>.</p>
        <h4><u>Rebranding Efforts</u></h4>
        <p>KFC will phase out the Colonel’s image from signage and packaging by year’s end. Historians note Sanders’ allegations of racism and his presense on the 1968 presidential campaign of Alabama Governor George Wallace, a noted opponent of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
        <p>"His presence on branding reminds many of a painful past," said <strong>Dr. Jamal Richardson</strong>, professor of American history at Howard University.</p>
        <h4><u>Social Media Response</u></h4>
        <p>The decision has sparked some backlash. Some say it’s long overdue, while critics call it corporate overreach. <em>"Outragous, will no longer buy KFC, strickly a Popeye's gal now"</em> tweeted activist <strong>Kimberly Harris</strong>. Others argue the Colonel's legacy is culinary, not political.</p>
        <p>Despite backlash, KFC stands firm, pledging <strong>$10 million</strong> to racial equity initiatives, including scholarships and funding for Black-owned businesses.</p>
        <h4><u>What’s Next?</u></h4>
        <p>KFC has yet to announce a new mascot or branding direction. But it has been rumored that the company will veer into more traditional influencer based marketing and has reached out to numerous celebrities including James Franco, Louis C.K. and Casey Affleck.</p>

            <p><strong>Gore Campaign Rocked by Wartime Allegations</strong></p>
            <p><em>Washington (CNN) —</em> As Al Gore campaigns for the Democratic nomination in 1992, controversy has erupted over his military record, with the governments of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos accusing the former senator of committing "grave violations of wartime conduct." While Gore has long portrayed his service as a brief, uneventful tour as a military journalist, new allegations suggest a far darker past—one that the campaign has so far not attempted to explain.</p>
            <p>Vietnamese officials released a statement claiming that Gore's unit operated "outside conventional military oversight" and was involved in actions that "violated all norms of warfare and human decency." Cambodian sources have gone further, alleging that Gore not only participated in unsanctioned cross-border raids but also "seized de facto control of an entire jungle province." A Laotian official, speaking anonymously, described Gore’s actions as "the sort of rogue behavior that led to widespread destabilization and humanitarian crises."</p>
            <p>Reports surfaced of an American unit that, by late 1970, had become "completely detached" from the U.S. chain of command, resorting to extreme measures to combat the Viet Cong. In what has been described as a "desperate and self-justifying" effort, the group allegedly executed local leaders suspected of collaboration, burned entire villages to the ground, and imposed "a reign of psychological warfare" upon the region. While the Pentagon initially dismissed these claims as war-time exaggeration, declassified documents reveal increasing concern over the unit’s leader—one "Colonel Gore"—who was described in internal memos as "exhibiting concerning autonomy" and "impossible to reintegrate into a traditional command structure."</p>
            <p>Gore’s campaign has categorically denied these claims, insisting that he merely wrote for military publications and was honorably discharged. However, a former South Vietnamese official, who declined to be named, stated, "We all knew of the man they called ‘the Yellow-King of the Jungle.’ Who took to wearing a necklace of severed ears around his neck. His followers carried out his will without question. He spoke of enlightened war, but his methods were anything but pure horror."</p>
            <p>While no direct evidence of Gore’s alleged war crimes has surfaced, his refusal to answer detailed questions has fueled further speculation. One Pentagon report from 1971 describes "a classified operation to extract an officer who had exceeded his mandate," with one line reading simply: <strong>"Terminate his command with immediate and extreme prejudice."</strong></p>

        <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">
        <p><strong>August 9, 2025 | By Greg Vaughn</strong> — It was no longer a surprise. But it was still a shock.</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago tonight, on a humid Tuesday in August, Americans gathered around televisions and computer screens to witness history: the resignation of the President.</p>
        <p>The announcement came after weeks of breathless headlines and Congressional hearings, months of speculation and a slow-drip unravelling of the Peso Scandal. It marked the first time a sitting U.S. president stepped down voluntarily under pressure from both parties.</p>
        <p>Rumsfeld had swept into office in 2000 as a no-nonsense foreign policy hawk, promising stability abroad and strength at home. But by the summer of 2005, his administration was besieged by revelations that senior White House aides had orchestrated an illicit campaign to coerce Democratic legislators into backing an emergency military appropriation for the ongoing conflict in Indonesia.</p>
        <p>The documents—leaked first to the <em>Washington Post</em> and later corroborated by audio tapes—revealed a sweeping pressure effort involving FBI surveillance, misuse of intelligence briefings, and personal threats against lawmakers unwilling to fund what opponents called “a discraceful campaign to uphold a dictatorship”</p>
        <p>“I have never been a quitter,” Rumsfeld said in his now-infamous resignation address. “But I believe the interests of the country must come before my own.”</p>
        <p>He left the White House the following morning, replaced by Vice President John Danforth, the soft-spoken Missourian who pledged to restore “quiet dignity and lawful conduct” to the highest office.</p>
