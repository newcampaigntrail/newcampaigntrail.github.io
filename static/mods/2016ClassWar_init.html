His presidency has been defined by more tax cuts for the rich and rolling back Obama’s already disappointing healthcare reform bill. With Republicans having held the presidency for 12 of the last 16 years, 8 of those under a president who didn’t even win the popular vote, the American people yearn for change.</p><p>The Democratic Party tried to stifle the people’s cries with the touting of failed establishment candidate Hillary Clinton, but during the primaries, the DNC drowned under the populist wave ushered in by progressive Senator Bernie Sanders. Having snatched the mantle of Democratic nominee, he has the potential to dismantle America’s corporate oligarchy and restore power to the people. Question is, will America <strong>feel the Bern?</strong></p>",
