When the 94 election was nearing it's end, that controversial ad his team aired was met with near immediate backlash. What seemed like a safe win for Jeb turned to a close and contested race where any decision thereafter would have disastrous effects for Jeb. The margin was close, but Jeb would be certain to be the next governor of Florida.</p><p>Now this, it seems Americans aren't as opposed to Jeb as the media and Democrats tried to paint to the general public. With this showing, it might lead to the Republicans getting more seats in the Senate, but that's just speculation at this point. What is certain is that Bush has the political power to go forward with his agenda to implement for the nation. May Jeb have a good 4 years and hopefully a second term, but with the level of this victory it might be all but certain."
