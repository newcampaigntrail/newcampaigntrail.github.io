The value of the dollar has plummeted such that everyday expenses threaten to bankrupt the working family. Gasoline shortages inspire such great panic that Americans shoot each other dead just for the chance at refueling their cars. Tehran's newly seated Islamic Republican government threatens to upend the tentatively held Middle Eastern order. America is a nation scarred by the tumultuous two decades previous, and by and large, blames the Democratic Party for its fall from grace.</p><p>As the Presidential Election of 1980 nears, Terry Dolan and the National Conservative Political Action Committee have marked five incumbent Democratic Senators for death. Vowing to do whatever necessary to upend the liberal order which brought America from the prosperity of the 50's and hope of the 60's to the despair of the 70's, a Republican revolution seems inevitable.</p></div>",

Chief clerk of the State legislature, chairman of the Young Republicans, state Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and federal Representative, one would imagine him to be a charming, ambitious man. This could not be further from the truth. Short, crowd averse, and suffering from a speech imepediment, Abdnor has found success because of his faults, not despite them. The man many expect Abdnor to be are the men the people of South Dakota are not. What he lacks in oration and wealth, he more than makes up for in his modesty, honesty, ability to compromise. His aw-shucks demeanor seems bizarrely out of place when juxtaposed against the national background.</p><p>The Republican Party seems poised to dominate the impending Congressional elections, even while Carter enjoys a polling advantage against the front-runner Ronald Reagan. For all intents and purposes, Abdnor simply must stay on this side of the soil to win this election, or at least that's what he's been told. Sure, he enjoys numerous advantageous, but he's been around in South Dakota politics for long enough not to count George out too soon. Despite his <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em> persona, Abdnor has no intention of impeding the conservative firestorm brewing against his opponent. South Dakotans deserve a Senator who truly represents them, and who better than a pro-life former farmer with an R next to his name?</div></div></div>",

Somewhat ironically, the Democratic Party is poised to suffer from their own electoral success. Flush with Democratic incumbents, DSCC leadership must ration what available resources at their disposal between its sitting members and what pick-ups seem possible to expand the majority. Georgia, North Carolina, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New York-- the states where cash will rain like bombs and ads thunder as the sound of distant explosions. To many senior Democrats, these states will decide the fate of the Senate, and South Dakota certainly won't. Senator McGovern has not been left out to dry by any means, but its no secret that if any of his colleagues are to go down, he is expected to go first and hardest. In lieu of relying upon the assistance of the national apparatus, McGovern will turn to what he always has-- his community. Although ruby red as they come, the South Dakota Democratic Party has seen success at propelling discounted candidates to the federal government despite the odds. Keeping the prairie statesman in Washington will require the herculean effort of local organizers, party leaders, and McGovern himself to prove to the DSCC that this race is not only worth fighting for, but winnable.</p></div></div></div>",

George Cunningham, Bill Dougherty, and Eleanor McGovern-- the three people who can truly say they hold McGovern's ear. Cunningham, a trusted legislative aide with a wonkish bent, serves mostly as an advisor to his boss, doing what he can to keep the McGovern message clear, consistent, and palatable to his constituents. Dougherty, battle tested on the national scene from the '72 campaign and from his own attempts at state office, runs campaigns in his sleep, although usually to meager success. And finally, principle among them, Eleanor McGovern. Not one for the political spotlight, Elanor is nonetheless supportive of her husband and his endeavors. While others in the court of King George want to propel him onwards and upwards, Elanor keeps him grounded.</p><p>Left largely to fend for themselves by the party apparatus more focused on races they deem winnable, the McGovern Office must do what they've always done-- the impossible. Mobilizing an effective ground game, countering notions of the Senator's apathy and political distance to South Dakota, and raising enough money to counter the deluge of funds pouring in from outside organizations will put the staff to the test like they've never faced before.</p></div>",
