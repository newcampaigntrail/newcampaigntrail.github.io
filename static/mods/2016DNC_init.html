Of course, it's always important to get outsider perspective as well.<br><br>Bernie Sanders - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Where-We-Go-Here-Resistance/dp/1250163269' target='_blank'>Where We Go From Here: Two Years In The Resistance</a><br>Bernie Sanders - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Our-Revolution-Believe-Bernie-Sanders/dp/1250132924' target='_blank'>Our Revolution</a><br>Hillary Clinton - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1501175564' target='_blank'>What Happened</a></p><h4>News Sources</h4>I can't list them all here, but coverage of the primaries, such as news from the time such as Sanders' <i>Daily News</i> incident really helped. Lots of <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Politico</i>, and <i>NBC</i> were used while researching. On the ground coverage is really valuable, if you can find any. Of course, it's more difficult for older elections.<br></p><h4>Debate Footage</h4><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDqZIgcSYtI&ab_channel=USPresidentialDebates' target='_blank'>Third Democratic Primary Debate - ABC News, 12/19/2015</a><br><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti2Nokoq1J4&ab_channel=NBCNews' target='_blank'>NBC News - YouTube Democratic Debate</a><br><br>Again, even if I was unable to list it all here, debate footage can be really valuable. You get to see the campaigns' strategies face off head-to-head, and you can see examples, such as Clinton attempting to flank Sanders from the left on issues such as Gun Control. It also makes for decent background audio when coding or writing.<br><br></p><h4>Election Results, Polling Data</h4><a href='https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&off=0&elect=1&f=0' target='_blank'>2016 Presidential Democratic Primary Election Results - US Elections Atlas</a><br><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html' target='_blank'><i>The New York Times</i> - 2016 Presidential Primaries Results</a><br><br>US Elections Atlas also had lots of polling data, and its clear that the polls were off in a lot of Midwestern states in the primaries, perhaps a sign of things to come?
