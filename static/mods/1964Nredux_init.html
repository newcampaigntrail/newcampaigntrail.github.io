Although his sermon-like speech served to strengthen his bond with the rural, religious, and working-class constituents in his home state and across the American heartland, it was panned by the media, Republican partisans, and even the establishment of his own party, leading to many predicting that his career in federal politics was dead. Perhaps they will be proven right after this election.</p><p>The governor finds himself in a challenging position currently, trailing President Nixon in every single poll. It seems the campaign is not one that expects to win, rather, it’s one that aims to keep the fragile Democratic coalition together for yet another cycle until the party once again tries to find an opening in the Republican machine in 1968. Still, that’s easier said than done; Clement must find a way to stop the bleeding of Black voters from the Democratic Party while ensuring that there is no Southern splinter candidacy, as well as attempting to hold previous Democrat margins in both the cities and the rurals. If Clement is able to pull this off, however, he may be able to give Tricky Dick an ever-so-slight scare.<br><br><br><button onclick='back4()'>Back</button>"

After allowing himself to stand as a candidate in the Democratic National Convention simply in an attempt to boost his national name recognition in anticipation for a planned run for the US Senate, Clement watched as the entire potential field either declined to run or dropped out due to scandal. Following Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson’s refusals to run, the nomination was left wide open, allowing for Clement to clinch the nomination on the 6th ballot, thanks to an uneasy alliance between Clement’s base, segregationists who initially supported Orval Faubus, and Westerners who previously backed Pat Brown, coming together to deny Hubert Humphrey the nomination.<br><br><button onclick='next4()'>More</button>"

In terms of foreign policy, his administration successfully orchestrated a coup in Cuba against Fidel Castro's Communist-aligned government, effectively making Cuba a United States puppet state. Another foreign policy challenge is the looming 'second Indochina War,' where staunch anti-Communists push for increased commitment, a stance met with some reluctance by the President.</p><p>With a robust economy, high approval rating, and the likelihood of an irrelevant opponent, it seems like it would take divine intervention to stop Nixon’s crusade.<br><br><br><button onclick='back3()'>Back</button>"

Another area where Nixon has seen domestic success was that of Civil Rights, where his administration successfully lobbied Congress to pass the 24th Amendment, outlawing poll taxes in the South. In terms of foreign policy, his administration successfully orchestrated a coup in Cuba against Fidel Castro's Communist-aligned government, effectively making Cuba a United States puppet state. Another foreign policy challenge is the looming 'second Indochina War,' where staunch anti-Communists push for increased commitment, a stance met with some reluctance by the President.</p><p>With a robust economy, high approval rating, and the likelihood of an irrelevant opponent, it seems like it would take divine intervention to stop Nixon’s crusade.<br><br><br><button onclick='back5()'>Back</button>"

He's finished when he quits.’’</i></p><p>If you had asked anyone what they thought about Richard Milhous Nixon after the Checkers scandal, they would’ve said his political career was over. If you would’ve asked them about it after the 1960 Presidential debate, they would’ve said that he would never occupy the Oval Office, always destined to be a lapdog to a much more popular politician. Yet, Nixon enters the 1964 election as the 35th and incumbent President of the United States, enjoying popularity that rivals that of Dwight Eisenhower himself during his first term.<br><br>Domestically, Nixon has governed in a vein not entirely dissimilar to Eisenhower, with a strong focus on reforming programs such as welfare in order to reduce fiscal bloat while keeping the original intention of the program. Another area where Nixon has seen domestic success was that of Civil Rights, where his administration has successfully lobbied Congress to pass the 24th Amendment, outlawing poll taxes in the South. In terms of foreign policy, he has overseen a coup in Cuba against Fidel Castro's Communist-aligned government, effectively making the island a United States rump state. Another challenge on the front is the looming civil war in Vietnam, where staunch anti-Communists push for increased commitment, a stance met with some reluctance by the President.</p><p>With a robust economy, high approval rating, and the likelihood of an irrelevant opponent, it seems like it would take divine intervention to stop Nixon’s crusade.","color_hex":"#b22b27","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/AAMeLB9.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>NO CANDIDATE REACHES 270 ELECTORAL VOTES!

First is character. Second is ability, for without it, character may be misused. Third is diplomacy, without which character and ability might be wasted.’’</i></p><p>Governor Frank Goad Clement of Tennessee should not be here. After delivering a speech at the DNC simply in an attempt to boost his national name recognition in anticipation for a planned run for the US Senate, Clement watched as his name was drafted into the Presidential nomination as a compromise, without his input. Following Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson’s refusals to run, the nomination was left wide open, allowing for Clement to clinch the nomination after 4 days of balloting, thanks to an uneasy alliance between Clement’s base, the campaigns of George Smathers and Stuart Symington, Southerners who initially supported Orval Faubus, and Westerners who previously backed Pat Brown, coming together to deny Hubert Humphrey the nomination.<br><br>Clement isn’t exactly an A-list candidate, but he isn’t a complete unknown, either; the governor is perhaps most renowned for his memorable keynote address at the 1956 Democratic Convention, delivered with a theatrical, almost Bryan-esque flair at the Chicago International Amphitheatre. Although his sermon-like speech served to strengthen his bond with the rural, religious, and working-class constituents in his home state and across the American heartland, it was panned by the media, Republican partisans, and even the establishment of his own party, leading to many predicting that his career in federal politics was dead. Perhaps they will be proven right after this election.</p><p>The governor finds himself in a challenging position currently, trailing President Nixon in every single poll. It seems the campaign is not one that expects to win, rather, it’s one that aims to keep the fragile Democratic coalition together for yet another cycle until the party once again tries to find a kink in the Republican machine to exploit in 1968. Still, that’s easier said than done; Clement must find a way to stop the bleeding of Black voters from the Democratic Party while minimizing damage from a Southern splinter candidacy, as well as attempting to hold previous Democrat margins in both the cities and the rurals. If Clement is able to pull this off, however, he may be able to give Tricky Dick an ever-so-slight scare, or maybe pull off what looks impossible at the onset...","color_hex":"#1E48D7","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/tnirP0g.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>NO CANDIDATE REACHES 270 ELECTORAL VOTES!

If you want a running mate that could cover up most of your own weaknesses, though, Gray should be your first choice.</p>","candidate_score":1,"running_mate":true,"scrollable":false,"partner":"3"}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1007,"fields":{"first_name":"George","last_name":"McGovern","election":9,"party":"Democratic","state":"South Dakota","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p><i>’’I'm fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in.’’</i></p><p><p><p>If you really want to burn every single bridge you had with the establishment, then Senator George Stanley McGovern is your guy.

This is Armageddon.</i>’’</i></p><p>Clarence 'Pat' Manion, now renowned for his radio and television show, the Manion Forum, first entered politics in the 1930s as a liberal law professor at Notre Dame and a veteran of the Great War. He was a vocal supporter of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal Coalition, and an academic. But by the Truman-Eisenhower years, however, he had risen to the position of Dean at Notre Dame and become a prominent, sometimes bombastic, figure on the American hard right.<br><br>From his involvement with the America First Committee to a brief stint in the Eisenhower administration, and now through his presence on television and radio, Manion has emerged as somewhat of a celebrity. Known for his unwavering, sometimes conspiratorial anti-communism and opposition to federal overreach, he has garnered attention in recent years for backing and occasionally organizing third-party presidential bids. His influence reached a peak during the current election cycle, particularly when he lent his guidance to Orval Faubus’s presidential campaign, which made waves with strong performances in the Democratic primaries and at the convention. Manion also used his platform to advocate for the 'Drop Nixon' campaign within hard-right circles.<br><br>After Governor Faubus opted out of a third-party presidential bid, Manion entered the race himself. Running under the newly formed 'American Party' label, his name is appearing on the ballot as the 'States Rights Democratic' party candidate in the Deep South, while in other states, he runs as an Independent or 'American' candidate. Manion aims to represent 'the invisible man' across the nation. While his campaign officially challenges the perceived dominance of the 'Nixon-Johnson uniparty' and calls for a return to conservative, constitutional principles, it also seeks to unite Taftite Republicans, and Southern Democrats—a move plainly viewed as an opportunistic effort to undermine the Clement campaign in the South.","color_hex":"#f28c28","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/okn7kaF.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":89,"fields":{"first_name":"Ross","last_name":"Barnett","election":9,"party":"American","state":"Mississipi","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p><i>’’Gentlemen, you are trampling on the sovereignty of this great state....
