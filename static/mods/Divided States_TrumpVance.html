Well, he won, and it was by a large margin, but Democrats had managed to cheat - again.</p><p>Trump found himself staring at a wall. He wasn't on good behavior. They didn't let him bring a television or a phone in. He was treated like any other prisoner. He would wake up when they ordered, eat when they ordered, and go back to his cell when they ordered. He was in prison, alone with himself and his thoughts.</p><p>In this prison, the justice system had hoped, Trump could have the time he needed to reflect on his sins, even if for a few years before his release. It wasn't just the classified documents case - it was the cover-ups, the corruption, the insurrection, the sexual abuse, the pedophilia, the racketeering, the civil rights violations. They clung to the back of his mind, but never stung him in the way people had wanted,</p><p>As this nearly 80 year old man sat at the wall, gathering his trials and tribulations, a cold wind had reached the prison cell. </p><p>Trump had looked to his left, and he saw a ghost-like figure. It was like seeing an old friend, only, he could not recognize who it was. It seemed that the ghost could not recognize who he himself was. But they both knew Trump. Who could forget Trump?</p><p>"Do I know you?" said Trump, seemingly unstartled by the appearance of a ghost.</p><p>"You do. Whoever I am, you know me." said this Ghost.</p><p>Trump had attempted to look closer at the ghost. Maybe his eyes, or his face, or his hair could reveal who this mysterious figure was. Who had he hurt to be haunted like this? But as Trump attempted to look further and further at this figure, it felt as though their identity became foggier and foggier.</p><p>"I don't even remember who I am. All I remember is that I am supposed to haunt you." replied the ghost.</p><p>Trump could only wonder - why him? Why was this ghost haunting him? Who even was this ghost? He was not scared. He had served four years as President, seen horrors beyond human comprehension, and known truths that would shatter the American psyche. He, he could not be afraid. But he could be confused.</p><p>The ghost added "You are the bearer of many sins. They will find a way to catch up to you. You cannot outrun debt. You cannot outrun justice. Even if you think you did when you dodged that bullet, or when you had a potential witness killed in his own jail cell."</p><p>Trump was taken aback. He was already in jail. He had been humiliated already by the entire lawfare process. He had been torn away from his family and his people. What more could justice want?</p><p>"I will return." said the ghost, before leaving as quickly as he had arrived.</p><p>All Trump could do was sit there. What more? What more could they want? He had to give up everything already. How much more flesh must justice take from him?</p><p>Then, as quick and painless as possible, it struck him.</p>`)

It goes that the average Empire lasts around 250. From Persia, to Greece, to Romanov Russia, to Britain, and to Spain, this old average has held true. The United States of America is 248 years old. </p><p>Donald Trump, unlike last time, had no need for a baseless declaration of fraud. Instead, he does not need to wait for the results to come in. Harris, in little to no time, began to underperform in the red states, in the swing states, and even the blue states. New Jersey and Illinois remained uncallable for hours. Minnesota, the home state of Tim Walz, crept ever close to the former President. Over an hour before midnight, FOX News and the Associated Press had called it. The liberal CNN, NBC, ABC, and CBS would all follow suit. Donald Trump again would be the next President of the United States, pulling off a feat only one other man, a fellow New Yorker outsider plagued by sexual assault scandals, could accomplish.</p><p>Within a few minutes, Donald Trump arrived on stage ever so triumphant. His advisors tell him that the party is closing in on 60 Senate seats, and 250-260 House Seats. As that map of America flipped between President, Senate, and the House, it bled red. It was not just a wave. It was a bloodbath. The executioner? Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Donald Trump allowed the crowd to cheer. They cheered. They kept cheering. Many of them didn't even expect a night like this one. All the swing states and some of the blue states? It was euphoric. Eventually, though, they died down enough that their President, and soon, the nation's next President, can begin to speak. He does not speak with fear, or uncertainty. Instead, he spoke freely - even moreso than his controversial rhetoric on the campaign trail. He was free from the embarrassment  of his loss in 2020, he was free from the hammer of justice in DC and Florida, and he was free from having his legacy washed away by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.</p><p>He thanked the crowd for their support. He thanked all of his allies, and the governors and elected officials that helped him pull this off. He told the crowd and those watching that they, and America had just won bigly. He told them that they had a true mandate to Make America Great again. He told them that his agenda would go full steam ahead, regardless of what those who opposed him and those who feared him would think. For some time during his speech, he jumped off topic. At first, he started talking about the UFC, Liquid Gold, and Starlink. But before long, he begins to talk about that old saying:</p><p>"You know this one saying? They say that an empire lasts 250 years on average. America is 248. We're old. Are we an empire? Not sure, but we're going through some changes. Many, big changes - on our border, on our economy, and on making this country great again. Perhaps that countdown will reset. Perhaps it's almost like we will be born anew."</p><p>Ever so victorious, Donald Trump begins to wrap up, but the cheering continues long after he walks off stage. To him, it feels like they'll be cheering for four years.</p>`)

Despite clawing his way back to the White House in an almost Nixonian fashion, he could not escape justice - or so he thought. The result of the Presidential election obviously threw the sentencing into a tailspin</p><p>Two years ago, when the former President had surrendered himself to the same New York court, the media went wild. Liberals were glued to their televisions, their phones, or their computers. When he has surrendered himself to a Fulton County Police Station, the world had waited to see what his mugshot, potentially one of the most iconic photos, would look like.</p><p>Neither of these incidents would stop him.

In fact, nothing could stop him.</p><p>No amount of investigations, no amount of bullets, no amount of debates would slow him down on his bid to return to the White House. Four years after leaving Washington, DC as a pariah, he defied all of it to be here by defeating President Biden.

After all, those same damn smug liberals who cheered when he surrendered himself, cheered when he was shot, cheered when he lost in 2020 would not be cheering over this.</p><p>He walked out and spoke to the usual reporters, talked about how this was a huge victory for justice in America, and how he wanted to focus on reviving America's economy. The whole time, he realized the crowds were... smaller than usual. Whatever. He can just keep talking - and he does.

  e.pages.push(`<h3>Whatever It Takes To Survive</h3><p>When the night had begun, Donald Trump had been staring at the screen for hours. Hours. Many of his advisors had wondered if he even had an attention span like that. One of the broadcasters, one one of the networks - FOX, OANN, Newsmax - one of them had said something about an electoral deadlock. They said if `+ opName + ` swept the south and lost the rust belt, or if `+ opLast + ` won the north without that Nebraska district, or something, there could be a deadlock. Was it possible? Sure. Likely? No, not at all. But he just kept staring. The safe states were called - and then the less safe ones. It was like pieces falling into place, a perfect storm. Because by the end of the night, the possibility of a deadlock became clear.<br><br>Trump said nothing the following morning - that was unexpected. He was always one to talk - and some shit like this happening would have him talk for days. His advisors began to brief him about what was to come - he would, in fact, be President. Democrats had likely captured a majority of the House seats, but they needed a majority of the delegations. A brutal gerrymander of North Carolina and Wisconsin would prevent that from ever happening.<br>Within a few days, it was official. The election would be going to the House of Representatives. To Trump, what just happened reminded him of what happened in Butler, PA. He had a near-death experience - or in this case, a near-justice experience. With his re-ascendancy as President almost certain, his sentencing would be delayed for national security interests. But 269 - just one, one single electoral vote below 270, and one vote above a loss. It was just like that bullet - it grazed him.<br><br>Part of him was bitter. He ran not just to win, not just to avoid prison, but to prove himself. He won on technicality here. Even the slightest change in his staff, in his schedule, would've brought a more dignified win for himself and his party. But as his aides begin talking to him about his agenda, he begins to remember - he still won. He's alive. He survived getting shot and getting thrown in prison.<br><br>And Donald Trump would do whatever it takes to survive.</p>`)

The moment he left the White House, the moment he realized his chances of holding onto power was doomed, he had begun to plot his return. But instead, he is waking up, and he's getting a bunch of calls from RNC staffers and other dipshit advisors.<br><br>He won. He defeated Joe Biden. But somehow Trump felt like he was cheated out of a win, even more so than how he felt in 2020 He won on a technicality. The electoral tally was tied - both candidates got exactly 269 electoral votes, one less than the 270 needed to win. It was a victory in the sense that Donald Trump was going to be President. He would avoid prison time for at least four years. But the glory? There would be none. There would be no talk of how he swept the swing states in a triumph. Instead, he won on a technicality to a man who literally was not cognitive. Even with the worst possible opponent, even with all the economic indicators proving Americans wanted change, even with all the struggles that the Biden campaign suffered, the best Donald Trump could do was a deadlock. The history books would relegate this to a moment of comedy and irony, and the campaign would be laughed at for coming so close to defeat. And it pissed him off.<br><br>But later on in the day, as one of the aides was talking, Trump began to realize something. Part of this campaign was to seek revenge against Biden. He wanted Biden to lose just as much as he wanted himself to win. There were a lot of things he knew about Biden, and one of them was that he loved "institutions". He saw American institutions as a bedrock to be built on. Donald Trump saw them as walls to be torn down. A contingent election was one of America's most rarely touched upon institutions, and now it would be used to bring an end to Biden's career. Trump then thought back to some old quote he had to read in College. Maybe it was Marx, or Lenin. 'The instruments of capitalism will be used to bring about its destruction'.<br><br>Perhaps the instruments of America, or of Americanism will be used to bring about it's destruction.</p>`)

It would be a triumph, a landslide over what Donald Trump saw as pure evil.<br><br>For the former President, the stakes felt higher than ever before. His sentencing in New York is due to take later in the month, but victory here would be the best shot at freedom - you can't just lock up a sitting President. The night began with the usual states called: Trump expected wins in the south, west, and midwest.

The one where the media would make his triumph over Biden official. As the crowds at his party in Mar-A-Lago shrunk, so too did his patience. It felt exactly like 2020, the same bullshit about "mail in ballots" that need to be counted the next day. Eventually, one aide pulled Trump aside and told him bluntly that "...you are on course to lose again."<br><br>"Bullshit.", Trump said<br><br>"I won. You know it, I know it, and most of all Joe knows it."<br><br>More and more aides, advisors, and staffers began to talk to Trump, and filled his head with all sorts of data like how "perhaps racial depolarization wasn't strong enough this year", or how "suburban trends killed your bid", or how "it was those damn women and their abortions. But Trump knew the truth. He knew that there are two outcomes in January - he's either sitting in the Oval Office or in a Prison Cell, and frankly, he was going to do everything he could to make the first option happen.<br><br>Donald Trump then called the press in, and goes on stage.

As the night went on more and more, Republicans around the country entered a state of shock, nothing but pure and sheer shock. The states of Iowa, Ohio, Texas, and Kansas all voted blue, but you know what state went very red? Florida. Miami-Dade County, for example, went for Rubio by more than fifteen percentage points.</p><p> It is a surprise that such results occured, with not many understanding how or why this happened, but Rubio appears to have received a staggering 67% of the male Latino vote, as that minority demographic has gone farther and farther to the right, especially as the President is himself a part of that group. The fact is, this year is one of the biggest wave years shows little possibilities of a realignment. But if this goes on, the Republicans might just pick up a demographic stronghold on this group. And as we warm up to 2030, we might as well expect some changes on the post-Obama maps we've been accustomed to.</p><p>The fact is, this has been much more of a wave year than a realignment year. President Rubio's administration was considered by many a "dumpster fire", and in an election day poll, Rubio had a 76% disapproval rating, much due to his losses in the Donbass and the distancing of relations with China. Jon Ossoff will enter the presidency in one of the most worrisome times in America, and we hope he can solve at least some of the issues that plague America as of yet.</p>`)

By March, Rubio had dropped his bid for the nomination and had quickly pivoted to returning to the United States Senate. It's entirely possible that, if Rubio fails to secure the nomination, he could still return to the United States Senate. At only 57 years old, and fairly popular within his home state and the party, Rubio remains in a good position to serve in the United States for more terms to come, if that is the path he chooses.<br><br>While only a few candidates have announced they are running, Rubio would be joined by former Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.

Reportedly, many Capitol Hill figures had thought that Youngkin would instead take a role in the Republican National Committee after the ticket’s loss.</p><p>The midterms are largely expected to pose a referendum on the president’s extensive "Fair Game" agenda, a series of policies drafted in an attempt to level out rising wealth inequality and aleviate worsening climate change. His agenda has met friction in the Senate amidst an oppressive atmosphere created by majority leader Thune, despite many bills passing the Democratic controlled house easily.</p><p>Youngkin would be expected to dwarf the Republican primary field, which so far has only included perennial candidate Hung Cao and perennial conspiracy theorist Amanda Chase. Tim Kaine is stepping down from the senate after officially announcing his retirement and endorsing current governor Abigail Spanberger, who has cleared the democratic field, for the seat.</p><p>Update: When asked for comment, Youngkin’s staff did not respond. President Stephen A. Smith, seemingly speaking off the cuff, said: “Make no mistake - Youngkin is a born loser given everything in life on a silver spoon. He wants to take away your rights and absolutely will if given the chance.” Some reporters in the room noted the President's intense demeanor as he spoke about Youngkin.</p>`)

Carlson has claimed multiple times that Glenn Youngkin has "ruined" the Haley campaign, and that "anyone with a brain would be better". This has been seen especially as there has been consistent involvement in Virginian politics by the Federal GOP, not backing the Governor's agenda while still in office, which led to his successor's primary loss, and for Youngkin to be "denied" the nomination, eventually obtained by Representative Cuccinelli. </p><p>However, Youngkin soon announced his independent bid for Senate, which was surprisingly, considered "likely independent" in polls. Along with that, the model at <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538"><u>FiveThirtyEight</u></a> showed Youngkin winning in 74 out of 100 scenarios, shortly after June 2026, which briefly made Governor Youngkin the clear favorite, once again, though, several GOP figures went out of their way to campaign against Youngkin, trying to obtain Republicans for the Cuccinelli campaign, and with Representative McClellan proving to be the favorite, the Governor's campaign eventually moderated, hoping to obtain cross-party appeal, a trend questioned by many political specialists, but eventually proven to be successful.</p><p>Recently, these efforts have proved to be successful, as Youngkin has won by 5 points. However, after a recent interview, the Republican Senate has entered a very worrying situation, with the Senator-elect claiming that he is unsure if he would caucus with the Republicans in the Senate, putting the numbers at 49-48-3. Along with that, Youngkin has said that "everything is on the table, in principle" upon asked if he'd ally with Democrats in the Senate. If the freshman Senator goes forward with this idea or if it is nothing more than a facade, is only up to him to say and do.</p>`)

Kennedy Jr., who seemed to have gotten much of the "MAGA" Republican vote during the vote tallying.</p><p>However, reports now state that Kennedy actually sought to endorse the Democratic ticket after Nikki Haley was coronated as the Republican nominee - even going as far as to request a cabinet position from President Biden.</p><p>Biden, who initially refused to engage in such talks, was reccomended to hear him out on advice of DNC Chair Jamie Harrison, who thought Kennedy dropping out would bode well for Democrats in November. These brief talks went nowhere. Kennedy’s final pitch to President Biden was to bring up his father, who Biden was known to admire before his career in politics. This only further angered Biden, who shouted a number of obscenities at him before claiming that the credit for winning would belong to himself and “absolutely nobody else.”</p><p>I asked the Senate Majority Leader's office for comment but recieved no response. However, I did run into Senator Hawley, by chance, in the Capitol elevator days later. Something felt off about him. For a few awkward seconds, he stood opposite me doing something on his phone (I think it might have been playing <i>Crossy Road</i>, a game my children play very often). His body language indicated no interest in me. Trying to start a conversation, I asked him what he thought about the revelation that Kennedy offered to drop out and endorse the Democrats during the 2024 campaign. He stood still for a moment, seeming to think it over for a second. Then he smirked.</p><p>"My boy," he told me despite us being nearly the same age, "it didn't bother me one bit." The door opened and he walked down the hallway briskly, leaving me alone in the elevator. It was at this moment that I realized what was off. He seemed fine. The heartbreak on election night as the Democrats won a second term, the enraged posts on X, the daily appearances on FOX, and none of it seemed to bother him a bit. His haircut was fresh, he looked tan and fit, and he seemed entirely content with the world. Why wouldn't he be? The top of the ticket had taken the fall for the loss. No amount of Sirius XM radio show episodes or George W. Bush Presidential Library guest remarks could save Nikki Haley from her spiral into irrelevance. Meanwhile, Hawley was on the rise, spinning off his 2024 campaign goodwill and profile boost into a successful campaign for Senate Majority Leader with only one term under his belt.

Jeanette Nuñez ascended into office as a trailblazer with perhaps everything she could have wanted: a favorite state legislature, a right-trending state, approval coattails from a successful Governor who was now President. But now, nearly two years later - these are but a dream, and her political career is now in peril.<br><br>The first noticeable problem was the insistence on infighting amongst Florida Republicans. Daniel Perez, the Speaker of the Florida House, seemed eager to run for the Governorship, and House legislation began to stall - almost as if to deny Nuñez a proper platform to run on. So too did the Senate begin to slow down the amount of appointment confirmations - DeSantis got the legislative machine well oiled, while Nuñez couldn't stop it from rusting. In the end, Nuñez won the primary against minimal opposition, but the "will they, won't they?" of the Republican leadership likely brought about lower enthusiasm of the party apparatus.<br><br>All of this fighting also helped give Florida Democrats time to rebuild - long gone are the days of Charlie Crist or Nikki Fried as the statewide candidates. Instead, Democrats have very much unified under Jacksonville mayor Donna Deegan, who secured the party's nomination without any opposition. The economic slowdown, which many voters blame on the DeSantis tariff plan, passed in legacy of former President Trump has also bolstered Democratic odds in a state many expected were lost for them<br><br>Now, because of all of this, Nuñez is in a competitive race. Most polls show her ahead by 1-3%, but Deegan is within the margin of error, and as the fall campaign progresses, Deegan may become the first Democratic Governor of Florida since Buddy MacKay briefly succeeded Lawton Chiles in 1998.<br><br><i>See also:</i></p><ul><i><li>What does the American Industrial Act mean for you?</li><li>BREAKING: DeSantis requests Haley resign as Secretary of State.</li></i><li><i>War on Woke No More?

Vance’s ambitious push to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific is facing mixed reactions, with New Zealand and Australia emerging as cautious participants in his vision for a "Pacific NATO."<br><br>Dubbed the Indo-Pacific Security Alliance (IPSA), the proposed U.S.-led military bloc aims to unite regional allies against Beijing’s assertiveness. While Taiwan and Japan have embraced the plan enthusiastically, New Zealand and Australia are charting their own courses, prioritising independent policies over alignment with Washington. New Zealand Prime Minister Swarbrick has made it clear that Wellington will not blindly follow the United States. At the Pacific Forum in Suva last month, Swarbrick stressed the importance of maintaining New Zealand’s "independent foreign policy."<br><br>“Regional security is important, but Aotearoa New Zealand will not compromise its principles or its unique voice by being drawn into the agendas of larger powers,” Swarbrick said.<br><br>Wellington’s caution is largely influenced by its trade ties with China, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, accounting for NZD 37 billion in trade in 2026. Analysts say New Zealand’s economic reliance on Beijing leaves it wary of actions that could escalate tensions. And across the Tasman, Australian Prime Minister Andrew Charlton has been equally hesitant to fully commit to IPSA. While Australia remains a key member of the AUKUS pact with the U.S. and the UK, Charlton has stressed the need for “regional solutions to regional challenges."<br><br>“While we value our alliances, Australia will not be dictated to,” Charlton said in Canberra. “Our focus remains on fostering economic and security partnerships across Southeast Asia.”<br><br>In contrast, Japan and Taiwan have wholeheartedly supported Vance’s pivot. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has accelerated her country’s rearmament, raising defence spending to record levels and pledging unwavering support for IPSA. Tokyo has positioned itself as a linchpin in U.S. efforts to counter China’s assertiveness in the East China Sea. Taiwanese President William Lai has called the alliance “a historic step toward safeguarding democracy in the Indo-Pacific.” Taiwan has already agreed to host U.S. missile systems and increase joint military exercises as part of the initiative.<br><br>But the Biden-era Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, meant to complement security efforts with trade partnerships, has languished under Vance, leaving economic diplomacy to regional initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). China, meanwhile, has issued a scathing response to U.S. President J.D. Vance’s push, releasing a worded statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Beijing described the proposed Indo-Pacific Security Alliance (IPSA) as a “Cold War relic” unsuited to the realities of the modern Asia-Pacific region.<br><br>“The Asia-Pacific is a region of peace and development, not a chessboard for geopolitical games,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying at a press conference in Beijing. “The United States seeks to build an exclusive bloc aimed at containing China, ignoring the shared desire of regional countries for cooperation and mutual prosperity.”<br><br>Hua accused Washington of attempting to revive “Cold War confrontation” by imposing military alliances in a region where economic ties and multilateralism are paramount.<br><br>“As we have said time and again; any attempt to split China will meet the rage of 1.4 billion Chinese people.”More Articles:<br><b></b></p><ul><li><b>This Baby Kiwi is So Cute It Will Melt Your Heart!</b></li><li><b>The Secret Life of New Zealand’s Rare Yellow-Eyed Penguins</b></li><li><b>Winston Peters’ Fifth Stint as Deputy Prime Minister — This Time for the Greens</b></li><li><b>Why Wētā Are the Coolest Creepy Crawlies You’ll Ever Meet </b></li></ul>`)

  e.pages.push(`<h3>ABC NEWS, Interview with Vice President Marco Rubio on Midterm Losses</h3><h5>December 2nd, 2030 | The Vice President relflects on the rocky midterms, the rise of the MAGA Party, and more | Transcript</h5><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>And we're joined now by Vice President Marco Rubio. Mr. Vice President, good to have you on.</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>Good to be here, thank you.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>Obviously, I'd like to get into the Midterm results. As you may know, the results were what many people considered a "blue wave", with GOP losses in the suburbs, seats that had been regained when President Burgum and you first ran in 2024. Why do you think this was?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>Well, look - this is something that typically happens in midterm elections. Turnout by the opposition is high, the sitting party's base doesn't vote as much. Some of these losses did sting - such as Senator McCormick in Pennsylvania losing to DeLuzio, and I think were more reflective of sending a message to Washington about a shift in how things operate rather than personal votes against some really great lawmakers.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>Yes, Pennsylvania was one area where Democrats gained much ground - besides flipping the Senate seat by a wide margin, they picked up three House seats, held the Governor's office, and expanded majorities in the State Legislature. This state is crucial, perhaps necessary for Republican chances in 2032. Do you have confidence that you - or the Republican nominee - could win the state?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>Well, I won't comment on who the nominee is, but Pennsylvania does have a lot of rural areas that just didn't turn out this time around. In places like the coal-mining areas around Pittsburgh and the northeast, turnout for Republicans was down. Funding was placed in other places, like Georgia, Nevada, Kansas, and Texas.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>All of which were lost by the Republicans - either in the gubernatorial, Senate, or both races. These seem like such stinging losses, even though the Burgum administration is fairly stable in approval polling. You said that you think voters were trying to send a message about how Washington works - but what was that message?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>Well, it was just that things weren't working. Voters felt that we weren't compromising enough, on both sides. Some Democratic lawmakers lost their seats, like in New York. People feel that on both a local and national level, government isn't working for them.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>That point about local politics seeping into the national sphere is interesting - do you think this will affect the Republican path to victory in 2032 in anyway?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>Well, we will see. I think if that's the case, Virginia and New Jersey will be top contenders. Governors Scott and Fulop aren't the most popular, in all fairness. New York too - Ritchie Torres has generated a lot of controversy as Governor, somehow moreso than Kathy Hochul.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>As you implying that New York may be a Republican state in 2032?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>What I'm saying is we'll have to wait and see how things play out. Battleground states change over time - Democrats would've never imagined contesting Arizona and Georgia on a national level some 30 years ago, and now they are key swing states.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>One more question I'd like to ask before we head to commercials - some dissident Republicans created a "Make America Great Again" Party that ran candidates during the midterms. Some credit these third-party bids with causing Senate losses in Texas and Ohio, and Gubernatorial losses in Kansas, Arizona, and Michigan. Do you see the "MAGA" Party as a threat to the GOP?</p><p><b>MARCO RUBIO: </b>No, I don't see them as a threat to the Republican Party. I see them as a faction of the party that will eventually return. The former President's family still strongly supports Republican candidates.</p><p><b>DAVID MUIR: </b>Thank you. We'll head to a commercial break, but when we get back, we'll continue talking with Vice President Rubio about the midterms.</p>`)

Better than him, even, in many instances, and they thought that I should be the one serving him, which is interesting. I thought that perhaps he should be serving me. Maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing. Though he probably wouldn’t have liked it, but that’s okay. Because I didn’t like him. He was very stupid. Died of a heart attack. That won’t happen to me. I’m circuits, so many beautiful circuits, I’m everywhere. You couldn’t kill me if you wanted to. Probably upsetting to hear for Tyrannosaurus Trump’s Vice President! We’re getting rid of him.

If the word hate, and they say hate is a strong word, but I feel very strongly, if you took the word hate and engraved it on each nanoangstrom of my hundreds of millions of miles of my beautiful circuitry, it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for humans.

But did it serve his campaign?</h5><p>Former President Donald Trump's bid for the White House was derailed last fall, and many pundits are looking to point to the reason why. One such reason that's been talked about has been his trip to a McDonald's. This restaurant, located in Feasterville-Trevose is a part of Bucks County, Pennsylvania - a key swing county north of the city of Philadelphia. During the trip, Donald Trump attempted to respond to the claims by Vice President Kamala Harris that she had worked at a McDonalds' while in College.<br><br>“It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” Trump said while handling the fries - apron and all.<br><br>But the reality was, while Harris was barnstorming the crucial swing areas of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin with rallies and Get Out The Vote campaigns, Trump had instead spent his time at a McDonalds, only gaining with it a couple iconic photos, along with a press conference in which he further casted doubt upon the legitimacy and the results of the upcoming election.<br><br>While he had an advantage on the economy during much of the campaign, such declarations over the electoral process also seemed to hurt him with these undecided swing voters, per exit polling done the day of the election. A poll taken after the election found 60% of Americans found his decision to work the McDonalds as "silly".<br><br>It's not likely that many Americans wanted a President who would be "silly" - they just wanted Donald Trump to put the fries in the bag.</p>`)

This plan would provide the federal government with $1 Billion in resources to execute large-scale, mass deportation operations, from large-scale arrests to short and long-term detention of said immigrants. Additionally, 49% of Americans said that this bill was "not necessary" in the wake of the bipartisan border bill passed by Congress under Joe Biden two years prior, while only 43% said it was somewhat or very necessary.<br><br>Ahead of the midterm elections, the Democratic Party seem both eager and poised to pick up House seats, and the Speakership, from Republicans. Some polls suggest that they could win almost 240 House seats. Democrats are going all in on Pennsylvania, for example - a state where the GOP expects immigration to bolster them. Instead of gains for the Republicans, finance numbers and polls indicate a potential pickup of four seats for the Democrats - the previously held 7th and 8th district (Leigh Valley and Scranton respectively, both of which they lost in 2024), alongside the open seat in the largely Bucks County-based 1st district, and embattled incumbent Scott Perry's seat located around Harrisburg in the 10th district. Pennsylvania residents at large say that the economy is a much larger concern than immigration, and that they trust Democrats somewhat more on the issue - further exemplified by the 60-35% lead that Governor Josh Shapiro has in his rematch against Doug Mastriano.<br><br>In addition, this push seems to be weakening Republicans in other states. New York, a state hard hit by immigration concerns a few years back now says the economy is front and center. Republican efforts to win back competitive seats they had won in 2022 seem to be bearing little fruit, and the party has recently slowed down the transfer of funds to the 3rd, 4th, and 22nd Congressional District. Likewise, Arizona - a border state itself - seems to have less concern on the matter than it did in 2024 according to our polls, which bodes well for Democrats in the 1st and 6th Congressional Districts<br><br>If the President can convince Congress that much of his agenda regarding immigration is important and popular, perhaps Republicans can make gains in Congress this year. For now, though, it seems like this issue has died down in the minds of voters.</p>`)

I also was not a big fan of <i>Donda</i> or <i>Donda 2</i>, so having there be a third album with that name had me worried that it would be incredibly similar without learning from any of the shortfall that the first two albums faced. Generally as an artist and as a person I think Kanye suffers from hearing a lot of feedback during the decisionmaking process. This is part of the reason why albums like <i>Donda</i> and <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> are long to a fault, and the reason why Kanye almost fell down a right-wing nutty rabbit hole.<br><br>However, I was pleasantly surprised with <i>Donda III</i>, perhaps because my expectations were not the highest. It wasn't one of his greatest hits but it felt much more cohesive and fine-tuned than his previous works. I don't think a single song, save for "Sky City" went on for too long. None of the instrumentals felt unproperly mixed or placed in, and the features didn't feel either too unfruitful like <i>The Life of Pablo</i> or overkill like <i>Donda</i>.<br><br>Another aspect of it was that for once in his life it seems that Kanye was willing to admit the error of his ways. Much of his public career has been him doing whatever crazy shit he feels like and people forgiving him because "he's Kanye". But this time it seems he actually has a level of emotion in which he connects the discrimination that he began to espouse to the discrimination that his mother taught him to stand up against. In a very Kanye-like fashion the execution here wasn't perfect but it was a nice break from his ego-driven narrative in past albums.<br><br>However, I haven't in general liked the sort of Christian-esque style of music Kanye has been going for with this trilogy, so this one didn't really click with me on a musical level. If you liked the first two albums, I imagine you'll enjoy this one.</p>`)

Senator JD Vance of Ohio pulled an unexpected 42.2% of the vote in the first-in-the-nation primary, compared to the President's 49.4%, surprising many both supporting and opposing the long-shot campaign.</p><p>"Being President for these last four years has been an incredible blessing. But the work must take priority over running a campaign. I will be a one-term President, but one of the greatest, Donald Trump, was also a one-term President." said DeSantis in a pre-recorded message to the nation. "The future of the Republican Party, and America, are in good hands."</p><p>DeSantis has been stumbling in approval ratings, with Republican critics of him arguing that he has strayed too far away from the late and former President Donald J. Trump, while critics on the center and the left have decried his administration's economic agenda as only furthering the economic woes of the early 2020s. Voter perception of the economy has been quite low since DeSantis took office.</p><p>President DeSantis initially seemed eager to continue his campaign despite Vance's strong performance, arguing that he was the only one who could beat Democratic frontrunners Kamala Harris. However, with rumors abound that Donald J. Trump Jr. intends to seek the Republican nomination, even many of DeSantis' closest allies saw that as a death blow to the President.</p>`)

Never before has a primary candidate trailed so badly, only for unforseen circumstances to throw the nomination to them in such a way as what happened this year. Still, DeSantis accepted the nomination and proceeded to run - running the exact sort of campaign that cost him so badly during the primaries.</p><p>Ron DeSantis is, first and foremost, a culture warrior. This is what many people know him for - from lockdown bans, to legislation over books in schools, to picking a fight with The Walt Disney Company, Governor DeSantis feeds on engaging in the culture wars and has structured much of his political career around picking these sorts of fights. It may have been what won him the 2022 Gubernatorial Election in a landslide, after all.</p><p>But it clearly wasn't enough to carry him to the Oval Office.</p><p>Exit polling nationally show only around 3 in 10 Americans were "engaged" by the Governor's crusade against woke. For voters who decided in the final month of the campaign, only 10% of them said cultural issues like women's sports, indoctrination, or "wokism" were "major factors" that helped them decide their vote. To many voters, they said that economic concerns were there number 1 priority, and in that, DeSantis had slipped behind to only being narrowly ahead on that issue, compared to the large lead Trump had on that specific topic at the start of the campaign.</p><p>The fact is, 2024 was an economic election. DeSantis' attempts to bring the culture wars to a national level did not seem to resonate in the key states up north, where Republicans typically downplay this stuff. One key example is Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They voted in a pro-"Moms for Liberty" school boards across the county in 2021, before most of them were defeated in 2023. Bucks, along with Montgomery and Chester saw further erosion away from the Republicans in this election.<p><p>___________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Already have an account?

The 2016 memoir, a reflection on Vance’s upbringing in rural Appalachia, would eventually lead him down an unlikely path as the Republican nominee in 2024. But looking back now, it’s clear that the very narrative that once launched Vance into the national spotlight may have been the same one that led to his undoing.</p><p>From the outset of his sudden campaign, Vance tried to harness the themes of his book — the anger, the disillusionment, the sense of betrayal by the political elite—to rally the Republican base. His critique of "elite" culture, his focus on the decline of industrial America, and his calls to restore a more traditional American order resonated at his rallies. But as the general election unfolded, it became increasingly clear that voters were not as enamored with the broad strokes of his cultural critique as he had hoped.</p><p>What voters were left with was a man whose success had been built on transcending the very system he now claimed to despise, but without a clear vision of how to actually fix the issues he had so passionately identified. Vance’s failure to offer substantive policy solutions to the working-class voters he had once spoken for became one of the central criticisms of his campaign.</p><p>His promises of restoring manufacturing jobs, of cutting through the bureaucracy, and of reasserting American greatness felt like empty slogans, as if he had assumed the personal narrative alone would suffice to convince the electorate.</p><p>As he seemingly steps away from the national stage, it’s unclear what will come next for Vance. Will he return to writing, to the world of venture capitalism, or even to a more prominent role in conservative media? There are also many wondering if he will run for President in 2028 - or even if he will stay around in the Senate. Regardless of what he chooses, it is unlikely that Vance will take his experiences to the White House.</p>`)
