I'm highly impressed if you read this far.<br>I sincerely hope you enjoyed this project, and maybe even found it educational about a turbulent period in American history. I find Richard Nixon to be an endlessly fascinating figure, so I enjoyed using this outlet to write about him and the times he lived in.<br><br>I quite literally could not have done it alone, so my endless thanks go to many people. Thanks to obummer for practically coding all of the CYOA parts of this himself, when I was hopelessly lost. Further thanks to RouteVenus, for a ton of help putting for the code of this entire project into working order, and for the amazing visuals for this mod. Additional thanks to Tex, for helping me with the code in so many different areas, but especially the million endings. Thanks again to ettingermentum for being a terrific playtester and helping write so many of these endings. Additionally thanks to verbluffen for advice on writing this project from the beginning, and spotting errors I wouldn't have otherwise noticed. Also, thanks to Danxv33, and Martha for providing excellent feedback from the start of this project through its conclusion. Thanks to Decstar for the ending constructor.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\", \"has_visits\": 1, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\"}}]");
