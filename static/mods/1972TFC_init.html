Seeing success in the foreign field while a keeping relative status quo domestically (minus some cuts to Great Society programs), this has only served to cement this belief.</p>However, the man is not without his faults. Anti-war protests continue to mount and the deadly Kent State shooting put the unpopularity of the Vietnam War on full display. Not only that, but his limited government-conservative ideals have led to agitation with some.
