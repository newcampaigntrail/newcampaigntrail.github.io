You have won the 1980 election.</h3><p>As the networks call the last few states that put you over the top, you can’t believe your luck. As you deliver your victory speech outside a hotel in Rockford, with Keke by your side, you reflect on the immense sacrifices you’ve made to get to where you are today. You’ve always been something of an odd fit for the Republican Party, swimming against the prevailing ideological currents and clashing with grassroots opinion, but your moderate instincts must have paid off during this campaign.<p><p>Already, journalists are speculating that the average American voted for you as they didn’t trust Brown to handle foreign policy, as well as being put off by his eccentric demeanor. Regardless, you were the clear beneficiary of a late surge in favour of the Republicans, and will become the fortieth President. Calming tensions in Iran and restoring the economy will be your first priorities, as well as keeping your party grounded in reality. Good luck, Mr. President-Elect. You are going to need it.</p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Sorry. You have lost the 1980 election.</h3><p>As the news anchors confirm that Jerry Brown has won enough states to ascend to the presidency, you find yourself delivering a rushed concession speech to a pack of bored journalists, as you mull over the inevitable nature of your loss. There were many factors working against you this time, from Ford’s unpopularity to the war in Iran and the mediocre economy. Once the race got underway, Hyde’s spoiler candidacy was a constant thorn in your side too.<p><p>The second guessing from Republicans will be bitter, and there are already reports that the Christian right are determined to set up pressure groups to make sure that one of their own is nominated in 1984. As for you, you’re just relieved to escape the national spotlight and head back to Rockford with Keke and the family.
