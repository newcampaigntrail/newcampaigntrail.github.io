You had assumed, perhaps naively, that whoever had yelled that out had been joking, or perhaps panicked over a contingent election. But an outright victory?<p><p> No, no, no, you tell yourself. The whole <em>point</em> of boosting Trump was to get yourself ahead in these red states, in these swing states. But it looks like you may have boosted him far <em>too</em> much. You freeze. Rubio might have been a conservative, one very much running against your goals, but at least he was sane. And Trump wasn’t gaining that much in the polls. This? After the Access Hollywood tape? After the most unserious and attacking campaign in Presidential history? After unified opposition from any reasonable people in government, and most of the unreasonable ones too?

He’d have to make deals with congress, with many of the Republicans who hate him. As you look toward the TV, now at a house map, you’re surprised when you see some Trump-backed third party candidates winning, with a constitution party candidate taking a house seat in Idaho, and Joe Miller taking out Lisa Merkowski in Alaska.

Those who supported you, however, put the blame towards Bernie Sanders, declaring him a spoiler candidate for Trump, who prevented your landslide victory. No matter who wins that debate in the Democratic Party, your political career is over. Get ready for retirement.

You hear the chair of the RNC blame Trump for the ‘victory of socialism over freedom,’ and of Trump’s newly planned news network. All that you get out of it is the end of your political career. You can only hope that Bernie’s Presidency is bad enough to elect a Democrat in four years.</i><br><br><button onclick='backe1()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;";

The whole <em>point</em> of boosting Trump was to get yourself ahead in these red states, in these swing states. But it looks like you may have boosted him far <em>too</em> much. You freeze. Rubio might have been a conservative, one very much running against your goals, but at least he was sane. And Trump wasn’t gaining that much in the polls. This? After the Access Hollywood tape? After the most unserious and attacking campaign in Presidential history? After unified opposition from any reasonable people in government, and most of the unreasonable ones too?

He’d have to make deals with congress, with many of the Republicans who hate him. As you look toward the TV, now at a house map, you’re surprised when you see some Trump-backed third party candidates winning, with a constitution party candidate taking a house seat in Idaho, and Joe Miller taking out Lisa Merkowski in Alaska.

No matter who wins that debate in the Democratic Party, your political career is over. Get ready for retirement. If you feel like it, you can write a memoir about what happened, but this was your last shot for the Presidency.

Republicans will under no circumstances go to Tulsi, but quite a few would rather abstain than vote for either. This is divisive in the caucus: a small group would rather simply pick Garcetti, despite him serving as a counter-weight to Rubio (potentially building a path to the Presidency in four years). Most would prefer to abstain, preventing a Vice President from being selected. The plan then would be for President Rubio to pick a more palatable option once in office.

Your road to the White House is murky, but you still have an outside shot of victory<p><p> With four flips in key states, Democrats have managed to take the Senate to a tie. This will could lead to the election of Eric Garcetti over Ben Carson in the Vice Presidential half of the contingent election, with Republican defections possible, at least from the likes of Lisa Merkowski or Susan Collins. That's not guaranteed, though. If you somehow manage to clear the House, you might have a loyal Vice President behind you these next four years. Otherwise, Garcetti, who would become the nations first Latino and first Jewish Vice President, may find himself serving as Donald Trump’s Vice President, or even becoming President himself if the House deadlocks.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Be ready to dig in and prepare for January, and start calling Pelosi and others in Congress.

They might be forced to if they want to prevent your Presidency, him being the only conservative candidate, but some representatives are skeptical on that front. Much of what most Republicans said after the so-called ‘Grab ‘em by the pussy’ tape leaked will be hard to walk back if they intend on voting for him. Then there’s Bernie, who may be able to attract a few defections for himself in the House, potentially deadlocking a few states. Your road to the White House is murky, but you still have an outside shot of victory.<p><p> The Senate, too, is still in Republican hands, but they're faced with an odd choice as the new Congress is ushered in: with yourself and Bernie in the top two, they'll have to pick between Tulsi Gabbard and Eric Garcetti for Vice President. McConnell would prefer that his caucus choose neither, hoping that whoever's in office come January 20th will be forced to go with a more conservative choice. Some moderates prefer to pick Garrcetti, though, so it's unclear whether the Senate will be deadlocked. If you manage to clear the House, you may have a Vice President on your side for the duration of your term, which is always a good thing. Otherwise, Garcetti, who would become the nations first Latino and first Jewish Vice President, could burnish a run in 2020 by serving as a more rational counter-weight to Trump.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p>Be ready to dig in and prepare for January, and start calling Pelosi and others in Congress.
