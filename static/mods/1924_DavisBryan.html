You mull the idea of running for a third term, with straw polling showing you have a chance to win.

You continue to endorse Democratic candidates for President, whilst also attempting to appeal to Republicans to take a more firm stance against the rise of Fascism in Europe. Eventually, Norris acquiesces and joins the war against Germany in 1943, before dying shortly after being re-elected.
