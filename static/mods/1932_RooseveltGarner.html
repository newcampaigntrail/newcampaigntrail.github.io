Farley have formally declared their candidacies for the Democratic nomination for president, which has set the stage for an unprecedented primary contest against incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt. The announcements come amidst growing concerns within the Democratic Party over Roosevelt’s potential decision to seek a third term, a move that breaks with a tradition dating back to George Washington.</p><p>From the onset of your second term, you recognize that the chances of being renominated are quite slim. Still, you at least push through your narrowly tailored recovery agenda through Congress, even as the people yearn for more.</p><p>John Nance Garner, a veteran of nearly four decades in public service, is a staunch advocate for fiscal conservatism and limited government. Garner, who served as Speaker of the House before joining Roosevelt’s ticket in 1932, has grown increasingly critical of the New Deal’s expansive programs. In a statement announcing his campaign, Garner said: "The presidency is a sacred trust, not a personal entitlement. I am running to restore balance to our government and to ensure that the principles of democracy remain intact for future generations."</p><p>James A. Farley, often credited as the architect of Roosevelt’s electoral successes in 1932 and 1936, has had a falling out with the President, and his break with Roosevelt stems largely from the president’s decision to seek a third term, a move Farley has publicly criticized as a breach of democratic precedent. "The Democratic Party belongs to the people, not to any one man," Farley said in a statement. "This race is about preserving the traditions and values that have made our party a force for good in this country.</p>President Roosevelt has yet to formally announce his candidacy but is widely expected to seek reelection, citing the ongoing economic recovery and mounting global tensions as reasons for continuity in leadership. Roosevelt’s supporters argue that his leadership during the Great Depression and his efforts to prepare the nation for potential involvement in the war in Europe justify his decision to pursue a third term. However, the president’s critics within the party, including Garner and Farley, contend that breaking the two-term precedent threatens the balance of power and sullies the democratic principle of rotational leadership.</p><p>This is the first time in modern history that a sitting president faces significant challenges from within his own party, and specifically from his own vice president. Party insiders warn that a divided convention could weaken the Democratic ticket in the general election.</p>`)

Despite some Congressional trouble in 1938, he was still widely popular, and the Republican Party was divided. However, Roosevelt had chosen to retire at the height of his popularity, largely in part due to a consensus on his successor - Mr. Cordell Hull. Hull had been Roosevelt's Vice President, and a key ally on foreign policy concerns - some called him the "Secretary of Secretary of State" owing to the degree of influence he held at the State Department. Roosevelt both trusted Hull and believed he could win the election, and so chose to forgo a third run.</p><p>The Republicans, meanwhile, reeling from their losses in 1932, 1934, and 1936, choose instead to make the election about foreign policy with the nomination of Robert Taft, a committed isolationist, after a long struggle at the Republican National Convention. With a growing number of internationalist Republicans, many felt slighted after Taft's nomination and instead choose to walk out of the convention.</p><p>As expected, the main issue of the day was international relations - a key topic was World War II had broken out the year prior. While Mr. Taft had flipped the Rockies, alongside Wisconsin, Indiana, and his home state of Ohio, even a gain of 82 electoral votes from Mr. Landon's margin was not enough to prevent Vice President Hull from winning and becoming the 33rd President of the United States.</p>`)

However, many of his allies choose not to fully believe this explanation, arguing that he was possibly poisoned by Mr. Roosevelt or one of his allies to remove a key rival and find a new running mate. While the influence of Ritchie soon collapsed after his death, some to this day believe the rumor that Mr. Roosevelt poisoned him.</p>`)

With the nation’s economy still mired in collapse following Herbert Hoover’s controversial second term, the Democrats have sought refuge in a candidate who promises stability over experimentation, restraint over radicalism.
