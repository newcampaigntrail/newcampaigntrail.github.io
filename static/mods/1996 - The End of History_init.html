On August 19th, 1991, a coup d'état is pulled off in the Soviet Union, ousting not only Gorbachev but also Boris Yeltsin from power, quickly allowing the State Committee on the State of Emergency, or the GKChP to assemble some form of a functioning government.

Pretty quickly, some of the Soviet Republics - most notably Ukraine, declare the Soviet Government illegitimately in power, and begin to ignore orders from Moscow, as do parts of the military.

In their official autopsy, Democrats blame a lack of a proper foreign policy platform, as that was voters' main concerns during much of the election.</p><h4>Special Thanks</h4><p>I want to thank everyone who playtested.
