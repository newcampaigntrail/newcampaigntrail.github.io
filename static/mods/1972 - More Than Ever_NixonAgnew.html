                <p>Major Anderson and Lieutenant Morgan marched down darkened White House halls. The curtains were drawn all across the building. Dim emergency lights were the only thing that marked their progress through the desolate building. <br><br>“How long are we—.” Mayor Anderson began. <br><br>“However long it takes, I guess.” said Lieutenant Morgan. There was no one else around but still he whispered like a man in a library. It was important that they be aware of their surroundings. Each day, sounds of violence seemed to get closer to the building. <br><br>“But what’s ‘it’? Are we talking until he schedules elections? Until the Army can put them down?” Anderson saw the pale, ghostly portrait of James Buchanan floating in the darkness and felt a chill go down his spine. He willed himself to look away. “What is it that we’re even—.” <br><br>Morgan’s hand shot out and grabbed the younger man by the chest. Anderson’s heart leapt. The words died on his lips. He felt certain the crisis had finally arrived home, that the anarchists had finally snuck their way into the building after weeks of rioting, that they were about to hear the whistling of a bomb dropped by an Air Force that had finally decided to cut its losses, that the Soviets were launching an attack. Instead, he followed Anderson’s gaze.  <br><br>At the end of the long, dark hallway was the dim light of a flashlight. And the man carrying it—. <br><br>“No,” gasped Anderson, almost without thinking. Morgan tightened his grip. A signal to shut up. <br><br>“You know, Jack. I suppose it was fitting that we have our own crises. You, Cuba. Me, the insurrectionists. Two sides of the same coin. What was it that you said?” <br><br>Anderson stared as the commander-in-chief spoke to a portrait on the wall. It was almost casual, the way the old man spoke, as if he were addressing an old friend.  <br><br>“‘Deliberate deception and offensive threats.’ That’s what we’re dealing with now. Only it’s not outside anymore. It’s inside. It’s contaminated us. Like a goddamn disease. And we can’t let it go unchecked. No no no no. I won’t be a Chamberlain for the anarchists, I won’t.” <br><br>Something glinted in the darkness. Anderson saw the president press a bottle to his lips and then give a sigh of relief. <br><br>“Al didn’t understand that. That’s why he left, why he betrayed us. He didn’t have what it took, but you and I do. We understand that you can’t just let the enemy win. You have to fight back. You have to show the sons of bitches their place. Even if it costs you everything.” <br><br>Another swig from the bottle. <br><br>“I suppose that’s why they took you away.” <br><br>The hallway fell silent. The president swayed on his feet, looking strange and spectral, like a creature from a bygone era. Then, as if the portrait had dismissed him, the president shook his head. He turned on his feet and walked back down the long hallway he’d come from. Anderson and Morgan watched until the president disappeared into blackness. The portrait of John F. Kennedy, on the wall, remained.  <br><br>In the far-off distance, they heard the encroaching rumble of gunfire. <br><br>

                <p>They had been waiting since four in the morning. <br><br>The younger officer grew impatient, tapping his feet on the hard wood floors, fidgeting with one of the buttons on his uniform. It was newly pressed and cleaned. He had been anticipating this day for months. He just didn’t think he’d be the one to do it. Surely his more intelligent and disciplined peers would be the men called upon for such a duty. But the order was as clear as it could be. He would be the man to deliver the news, along with his elder counterpart, of course. <br><br>Graying at the temples, the older man’s uniform was rumpled, creased and wrinkled from years of use. But wit and ingenuity never ceased. He had witnessed horrors beyond his comprehension. He had held men bleeding out in his own arms. He had stared death in the eye on the battlefield and lived to tell the tale. And now here he was, in a shabby room cocooned within a vast building constructed just three years ago for a single guest. The elder man maintained a sense of playfulness in spite of it all, but even his patience was wearing thin.  <br><br>Then it struck him.  <br><br>A broad grin spreading across his face, the elder man motioned at his younger counterpart to move closer. The youthful man leaned in and the elder whispered, “陈，跟我来” <br><br>“跟着你去哪儿？你是什么意思？” the younger man asked. <br><br>你会发现的。快来,” the older man pointed towards the door, “上楼梯” <br><br>The younger man shook his head. “好吧,” he sighed, “至少比在这里等待要好” <br><br>The two men began to climb. The younger officer would crane his neck, trying to get a glimpse of life on the other floors, but there was none. Only dusty boxes that appeared like they had been there for years. What was this strange place? Sure, he knew the circumstances of the guest’s arrival, everyone in Beijing did. The entire world heard about it. He even understood why this guest was in such a place, given all he did for the People’s Republic, and how he disgraced the imperialist dogs who commanded him. But the guest had never once appeared in public while he was here. Surely he knew of all the rumors that swirled. But not once did he seek to correct them, instead he hid from the people inside his winding tower. <br><br>“停止,” the older man called out. The younger man stumbled. He had been distracted and didn’t even notice the massive wooden doors now before them. And what was that noise coming from behind them? Was there someone else in there the guest was talking to? Or is that…crying? <br><br>The elder man rapped his knuckles on the doors twice and the noise stopped.  <br><br>“哦，等等。” the elder man whispered, fumbling for a small piece of paper in his pocket, when suddenly the doors swung open. The youthful man could not suppress a gasp.  <br><br>Here sat Richard Nixon, yankee pig, sitting next to the roaring fireplace during a sweltering heat wave. It was not the fact that this man was in seclusion in Beijing that shocked the youthful man, but how this most important political exile looked. The oil seeping through his hair had dribbled down his skull, his weathered face sported a growing beard that had clearly come through negligence and not taste, and his bloodshot eyes watered with tears. <br><br>“What is it?” he spat out with barely concealed venom. “Why have you disturbed me?” <br><br>The elder man drew a shaky breath, then looked down at the page in his hands, and exhaled. <br><br>“Richard Nixon, as chief aggressor of the rabid, ah, imperialist power, which has…which has failed to smash the revolutionary peoples of Indochina and Cuba, and for your recent, er, counterrevolutionary thinking, the 10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has called for, er, 你怎么说？批鬥? oh, ah, has called for you to engage in a, uh, struggle session.” <br><br>

                <p>“I’m surprised he hasn’t blown his brains out at this rate.” <br><br>The older Marshal swatted away the comment in-between smokes, insisting that this defendant was different, that he wasn’t just another common crook. “You don’t get it,” he heaved, “the man’s changed since he was forced out.” <br><br>“Christ, don’t tell me, another ‘New-” <br><br>“No, no, it’s not like that. He’s not marketing it to anybody this time. This time it’s…” the man searched for the words in the cigarette smoke, ultimately failing to grasp just how to describe the man in the docket today.  <br><br>“Well, we’ve still got another half hour until this damn hearing, and I’m already starving, so I hope the bastard gets it over with and just shoots himself first.” <br><br>The older Marshal, visibly agitated, tried to form a retort, but fell silent. Even he could see that this man was reduced to nothing but a cruel punchline now. A poor joke.  <br><br>“Actually,” he began, “you could see him now…” <br><br>“Forget it, I’m not paying him a jailhouse visit, he’d just rant about Kennedy probably. I don’t need to hear that shit.” <br><br>“He’s not in a cell right now. I guess they all took pity on him and decided to let him mill around an empty jury room. He’s probably in one as we speak.” <br><br>The younger Marshal reeled from the shock. How is it possible that this man, who has suffered more humiliations than perhaps anyone in history, is finally pitied? How could anyone look at him and decide not to pile on the punishments. <br><br>Anticipating his comeback, the older Marshal simply shrugged, and checked his watch, then peered around the corner.  <br><br>“Come to think of it…” he added before trailing off. The younger man knew where this was going. <br><br>“Just lead the way.” <br><br>The two men milled through the halls, descending staircases and slinking through side entrances the younger one never knew existed, traversing the dimly lit fluorescent halls, before finally stopping at a wooden door, surrounded with yellowed peeling tile. The younger Marshal stepped in something, a stain on the motheaten brown carpet. <br><br>“Gross, I just got th-” <br><br>The elder man held his hand up to silence him. Nudging the door open, as softly as he could, the older Marshal peered in. Eyes wide, he motioned for his younger counterpart to come closer, to hear the sound for himself. <br><br>“I knew he’d never fucking do it. Bastard never had the balls. Goddamn coward.” <br><br>The man in the empty deliberations room paced nervously, sweating in the late summer heat, eyes fixed to the ground. <br><br>“We had a goddamn deal. The son-of-a-bitch only got the job because of me. I gave it to him. And he spat in my damn face. You know something about that, don’t you?” <br><br>His back turned to the two Marshals, still unaware of their presence, the nervous man’s head shifted up, as if there was someone else in the room with him. But the two couldn’t see another figure. <br><br>“Johnson was always an ungrateful low-life. A goddamn…a killer. That’s what he was. A murdering son-of-a-bitch. A cheating, lying, thieving scum who deserved what he got. Mine was just as bad as yours. Well, except…I suppose mine didn’t kill me.” <br><br>The nervous man let out a strained chuckle, one that then grew louder, like a weight had just been lifted off his shoulders. His entire demeanor changed in an instant. The man was no longer nervous, he was…laughing. Laughing hysterically. <br><br>The Marshals heard sprinting down the hall, and they darted back, watching two other guards rush into the room.  <br><br>“You aren’t supposed to be in here!” one shouted. <br><br>But the laughing man wouldn’t go quietly. He had to be lifted up from the ground and dragged out, all the way down the hallway, and back to his padded cell.  <br><br>The older Marshal breathed a heavy sigh, then motioned at the younger man to leave. But his more youthful counterpart refused. He wanted to meet the other man in the room first. Pushing the door open, he finally saw who the former president had been talking to. The same portrait that had been hung up in this dusty unused spare room many years ago, to inaugurate a new era, a New Frontier. At the sight of John F. Kennedy’s face, yellowed with time in the cheap plastic frame, all the Marshal could do was laugh too. <br><br>

The younger man’s foot rapped against the carpet.<br><br>“Is it usual for these to start so late? Maybe they’re all just ‘busy at work,’ like you said, but this is important. There’s guys sitting on the runway at Guam waiting for his sign-off. We’ve already gotten State’s approval, so what’s the hold-up?”<br><br>The older man shook his head. "Oh, he's not in the Oval. He's talking. He's talking to..." His eyes became distant and glassy. After a moment lost in thought, the man sighed. "No escaping it. Why don't I just show you?"<br><br>The two officers milled through the sparse White House halls. Most younger staffers worked out of EOB, the holidays were in full swing, and it was now late into the evening when most high-level appointees had gone home. Only the Secret Service were visible. Ascending several flights of stairs and navigating through the darkened, narrow hallways, the young man felt winded finding his way around the labyrinthian building. <br><br>“I thought you said we would see him?” the younger man complained.<br><br>“I know, I know, I thought…” the elder officer’s voice trailed off. “Forget it, I guess he’s not here.”<br><br>“Good one, sir,” the younger officer grunted in barely concealed frustration.<br><br>As the pair slunk back to that same cramped office to wait for their briefing, the president could not hear them from inside the cocoon of the Oval Office. As he always did before major speeches, he sealed himself in a room for days, isolated from the rest of the world, blaring Richard Rodgers’ showtunes. His favorite, the president would tell his closest confidantes, was <i>Victory at Sea</i>. On the eve of his greatest triumphs, the president closed his eyes and listened, as if he were back on the warships he had gambled away his last few dollars on. If he concentrated hard enough, Richard Nixon could almost hear the waves crashing beneath his feet.<br><br>But there were no more speeches to write, no more Democrats to vanquish, no more wars to win. The fire inside him, that had strengthened his resolve through the worst hardships of his life, was now simmering. The next four years paralyzed Dick. He had to live up to expectations no other president could reach. The hopes and fears of an ungrateful nation that had finally let him into the company of Roosevelt, Jefferson, and Lincoln. But <i>one</i> still remained out of reach.<br><br><i>He</i> never had to live up to this, Nixon thought with a grimace.<br><br><i>He</i> never had to end the wars he started. <i>He</i> never had to reckon with the movements he ignored. <i>He</i> never had to pay off the expenses he piled up.<br><br>The fire rose. Nixon’s grip on the arms of his chair tightened. The very thought of <i>that man</i> rendered Dick speechless, the flames choking him on his own words. Dick could not even utter <i>his</i> name. His allies liked to think it was rage at that entire bastard family for how they swindled the country. But it was something different. When Nixon thought of that smug prick’s perfect hair and his million-dollar grin, the fire grew higher. Nixon had injured himself opening a car door the same day <i>that man</i> had finished an afternoon of sailing, a tennis match with his aides, and then smiled his way to the presidency at the debates. <br><br><i>He</i> had never done a goddamned thing to earn the nation’s love. To earn Dick’s. The only thing that placed him above all other presidents was the bullet to his head. <br><br>If he had only been a few inches to the left, Nixon thought, the country would have learned how worthless that grin really was. Dick had learned from experience. He thought back to that train ride so many years ago, snaking through Western Pennsylvania, when Dick spent the night with <i>him</i>. When Dick first felt the fire. He had been impressed by that Brahmin too, flushing bright red when<i> that man</i> asked Dick who had tailored the suit he had bought at a Washington department store. Before Dick could answer, <i>that man</i> flashed a grin, placing a hand on Dick’s shoulder, telling him he was only joking, and that the cheap suit this Boston blue-blood was wearing had also been bought off-the-rack. <br><br>From that moment on, they were up all night, spending the train ride swapping war stories and probing each other’s weaknesses. For a moment, Dick thought, it almost seemed like he had found a friend, perhaps more. Perhaps a political ally, one to keep close as both men shot through the ranks of their parties, both gaining on their respective presidential nominations. Perhaps <i>this man</i> was the answer to the flames coursing through Dick. A childish fantasy, Dick thought now, to imagine he would have ever gotten close to Jack. <br><br>Dick wiped the tears from his face, laughing, remembering how his mother would scold him for crying so often. At Arthur’s side, by Harold’s bed, inside the walls of his New York penthouse surrounded by ancient Chinese art as the news poured in from Dallas. The fire reached his eyes. <br><br>Dick pushed himself away from his desk, feeling dizzy now, and opened the drawer. Taking the piece of cold steel out, Dick gazed up at the moon once more, remembering what Kennedy had said years ago. Nixon had shaken the hands of the men who walked on the lunar surface. He had turned those empty words into action. He had been given a greater achievement than any man in the nation’s history. He had fulfilled the dream. Now he had to take his final bow, and ascend to that pantheon, the one only Jack was at. Dick took one last look before the fire consumed him.<br><br></p>

                “I don’t know what I expected, but God, it feels like a funeral around here.”<br><br> Major Anderson waved this suggestion off. “They’re just busy, this business in Paris is dragging on a lot longer than any of them had hoped, working through the holidays will do that to you.”<br><br>“Maybe, but those hippies outside seemed pretty down too” muttered Lieutenant Morgan. “Only passed a few on the way in. Singing some hymn with candles out. Almost feel sorry for them, still showing up after all that in this weather. Guess it takes some commitment.”<br><br>Major Anderson nodded before taking another sip from his flask. The younger man’s foot rapped against the carpet.<br><br>“Still, I suppose they’re going to be screaming again once this makes the news. But what exactly are we waiting for here? DoD and State have approved this, apparently the good doctor has too. But what’s he doing? Just sitting around the Oval?”<br><br>The older man shook his head. "Oh, he's not in the Oval. He's talking. He's talking to..." His eyes became distant and glassy. After a moment lost in thought, the man sighed. "No escaping it. Why don't I just show you?"<br><br>The two officers milled through the sparse White House halls. Most younger staffers worked out of EOB, the holidays were in full swing, and it was now late into the evening when most high-level appointees had gone home. Only the Secret Service were visible. Ascending several flights of stairs and navigating through the darkened, narrow hallways, the young man felt winded finding his way around the labyrinthian building. <br><br>“I thought you said we would see hi—.”<br><br>The elder man held his hand up and turned around to make a soft shhh noise. Peering around the corner of the hallway, the Major quickly pulled back, looking at the Lieutenant and mouthing “back there.” The Lieutenant swallowed inched around the corner to get a look for himself.<br><br>“Did you see Wicker’s ramblings in The Times? Said it wasn’t a mandate, called it a ‘real victory’ for the anti-war types, because the Republicans lost a few seats in Congress. Sons-of-bitches. They would never recognize us. Never.”<br><br>The president paced back and forth, nursing a bottle of brandy, but never treading far. His gaze fixating downward, his fists clenched. <br><br>“That’s how they were always going to piss on this thing. The bastards in the media. Showering those animals against us with praise. Christ, I watched that concession speech, incidentally. It was the most disgusting goddamn thing I’ve ever heard. Could hardly believe the tone of it when it was read to me. Didn’t mention my name once, bitching about ‘dirty tricks,’ it’s a goddamn disgrace. ”<br><br>Silence.<br><br>“But it just wasn’t enough. That’s the damn problem. It’s never good enough, in anything. In the election…they say we could have won more. In Vietnam, Christ, Henry’s blowing it in Paris. Wasting our damn time. But it’s never easy, it never was for us, on the lemon ranch. Mother told us boys that, after Arthur…”<br><br>The president’s voice grew hoarse. Stopping in his tracks, he shuddered for a moment, wiping the sweat from his brow, his hands trembling before recovering. <br><br>“It’s what they said about me back in ‘46 though, when we beat that son-of-a-bitch Voorhis, their darling. ‘Wasn’t a mandate,’ they said, ‘not a real victory.’” Bullshit! We had him by the balls and he croaked. They never forgave us for that, for him, for Hiss. Should have seen the looks on their faces when we found that goddamn pumpkin, Christ…”<br><br>Nixon chortled to no one but himself.<br><br>“This Watergate business is how they’ll get back at us for that. They’ll try to find their own Chambers, find their own typewriter, it’s the same trick they always pull. They don’t remember what came after though, those bastards in the press, what it led to. You remember that, when he stood there waving that paper, ‘I have in my hand here a list of 205…infested in the State Department.’ He was damn useful to us…it just got out of hand. Could have swallowed us whole. You know they made me the one to put the son-of-a-bitch down. When you shoot rats, you gotta hit them right between the eyes, not wildly…they never understood that.”<br><br>His portrait loomed, hung up high upon the wall, already larger than life, John F. Kennedy was forever immortalized on enormous canvas. His head held low, his arms crossed, deep in thought. Always at the ready for late-night ruminations with the current White House occupant.<br><br>“You never know what forces these things unleash, Jack” Nixon muttered. “They’re playing with fire over this Watergate business.”<br><br>The president took another drink.<br><br>“You feed these…these beasts, but they keep growing…getting so large they want to consume you next. You know something about that..”<br><br>“Mr. President—.”<br><br>Nixon whirled around. Lieutenant Morgan leaped backwards behind the corner, white as a ghost, Major Anderson barely suppressing his horror. The Chief of Staff cleared his throat once more, still standing in the doorway down the hall, knuckles tapping the walls.<br><br>“Your meeting with the Air Force team regarding the strike on those targets up North, Mr. President. They’re ready to see you now.”<br><br>

                “Is everyone hiding in the bunkers or something? Where are they?” <br><br>Major Anderson shrugged. “Nothing they haven’t dealt with before. But it’s the holidays, everyone’s either back home in Virginia or buried in their work.”<br><br>“The fucking hippies aren’t” muttered Lieutenant Morgan. “Getting in here was a real pain. Some kid started screaming at me that I work for Hitler. Guess I thought last month would have scared them off, but they never quit.”<br><br>Major Anderson sighed wearily before taking another sip from his flask. The younger man’s foot rapped against the carpet.<br><br>“But if last month got their panties in a twist, I can’t imagine what this will do. I mean this thing is so hush-hush, I can’t imagine the scale of it. DoD and State both signed off, so where is he? Those boys in Guam are sitting on the runway waiting for our signal, and he’s just in the Oval?”<br><br>The older man shook his head. "Oh, he's not in the Oval. He's talking. He's talking to..."

Anarchy in the streets. Bombings every week. The Panthers, homosexuals, women's lib types. They stayed quiet. You see what that son-of-a-bitch Pierson wrote in the journal? Said we’re inflating it, that this isn’t a real threat. Bullshit. He doesn’t know a damn thing. I thought that paper was on our side.”<br><br>His arms crossed, the president paced back and forth near the end of the hallway, with his gaze fixed downward.<br><br>“They’re all moaning about how it wasn’t good enough. ‘Didn’t win every state.’ Lost seats in Congress. Christ. Mankiewicz is already saying we only bombed the hell out of the North to prop up a failing campaign. Called it rallying around the flag. It’s nonsense. The bastards will do anything they can to avoid talking about what a miserable defeat they had. Screaming about it in the streets, it’s a goddamn disgrace.”<br><br>The president paused for a moment, looking up at the ceiling. Lost in thought, he shook his head before resuming his nervous walk.<br><br>“Hell, I watched that concession speech. Couldn’t even call it that, really, refused to even call me by name. The crowd was in damn hysterics, I saw one shot of this dumb son-of-a-bitch crying his eyes out. They couldn’t believe it. Well good riddance. They were never gracious in ‘68 either. That was barely even a victory, can hardly call it that, and after all we did too. All that dragon lady did. This Watergate business…God if they open up that scab, there’s a hell of a lot more under it than some shit-ass little burglary..”<br><br>Silence.<br><br>“But they never gave us credit. The liberal bastards. Never. Never. They didn’t treat us like any other wartime presidents. Like Roosevelt, Truman, that smug goddamned Ike. They couldn’t resist bringing up what I did during the war either. Wild distortions…said I spent it all gambling o black market tires with Bebe Rebozo…it’s a goddamned lie. Makes me sick! They never could live down that I wasn’t-”<br><br>The president stopped himself. Looking up at the portrait. There John F. Kennedy stood, arms folded, brow furrowed, eyes lowered. He never moved from his canvas.<br><br>“No, Jack…I didn’t mean it like that…would never,” Nixon stammered. “They just never thought I was man enough. This country needs to know you can kill. That’s all it is. They want to know you can gnash your teeth and rip them limb from goddamn limb if you have to.”<br><br>“Mr. President—.”<br><br>Nixon whirled around. Lieutenant Morgan leaped backwards behind the corner, white as a ghost, Major Anderson barely suppressing his laugh.

Saying it wasn’t a mandate. That’s what Chancellor called it. ‘Unconvincing.’ The useless bastard. Incidentally none of those liberals ever confront the fact that they blew it. They lost.”<br><br>The president paced back and forth, nursing a bottle of brandy, but never treading far. His gaze fixating downward, his fists clenched. <br><br>“They just try to tear the president down, that’s all they ever do. Now it’s this business over a break-in at the Watergate, that’s what they’ll try to pin on the president. Never knew, never knew any of these people. Who the hell would send Howard Hunt to break into a goddamn hotel?”<br><br>Silence.<br><br>“You would know. The Bay of Pigs business, those operations down in, wherever. You remember it. They all try to deny, say it was some out-of-control plot, bullshit. You all act like priests over these things. Makes me sick. You knew, of course you goddamn knew, and your bastard friend O’Brien was behind this too, I know it.”<br><br>His voice grew raspy, the circles under his eyes more apparent than ever. He always had these sleepless nights before major decisions. During these crises.<br><br>“That smug prick Schorr was raving about it the other day, the hysterical son-of-a-bitch. Said it was a ‘White House plot’, can you believe that? Libel, that’s what that is, it’s damned dangerous. You never know what these things can provoke. Saying this was a conspiracy…they’re messing with the primal forces of nature, tidal gravity, ecological bal-”<br><br>His drink spilling, the president fell suddenly silent.

That’s where this is leading. Of course they never said yours was.”<br><br>His portrait loomed, hung up high upon the wall, already larger than life, John F. Kennedy was forever immortalized on enormous canvas. His head held low, his arms crossed, deep in thought. Always at the ready for late-night ruminations with the current White House occupant.<br><br>“You know a thing or two about stealing. That’s all your rotten family is good for. Taking what was rightfully ours and getting all the credit. Except for Vietnam! You started the damned thing but no, no, it’s not Kennedy’s war, it’s Nixon’s war. Cocksuckers! They don’t know a thing. Christ, you killed the son-of-a-bitch Diem and his bastard brother. Shot him like a goddamn animal, you—.”<br><br>His drink spilling, the president fell suddenly silent. Crouching to pick up the glass not broken, Nixon gazed up, now on his knees.<br><br>“I’m sorry, Jack” he muttered. “Shouldn’t…shouldn’t have said it…”<br><br>The president then clambered up, clumsily, never losing eye contact.<br><br>“But Christ they never let up. It’s always our damned fault. Hell, I’m proud of it. We’ve got those bums wailing in the streets, the Vietnamese on he run, who gives a damn about those negotiations? What we need is a final victory, just bomb the hell out of them, every last one of them.”<br><br>“Mr. President—.”<br><br>Nixon whirled around. Lieutenant Morgan leaped backwards behind the corner, white as a ghost, Major Anderson barely suppressing his laugh. The Chief of Staff cleared his throat once more, still standing in the doorway down the hall, knuckles tapping the walls.<br><br>“Your meeting with the Air Force team regarding the strike on those targets in Laos, Mr. President. They’re ready to see you now.”<br><br>

Wow.<br><br>Morgan: Whittier gets the ball at the fifteen! Los Angeles is out of timeouts! The Cardinals just need to take a knee, and they’re champions!<br><br>Anderson:...<br><br>Morgan: Oh, goodness, I wish you all could listen to this crowd! We sure haven’t seen anything like this before. Ain’t that right, Andy?<br><br>Anderson:...<br><br>Morgan: Andy? Pal? I see you thinking over there. These celebrations won’t be over for a minute or two, you can say what’s on your mind.<br><br>Anderson: Well…you know. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said I wasn’t a little worried. There are a lot of folks out there who weren’t ever pleased about the Cardinals being here in the first place.<br><br>Morgan: Ah. Of course. Well, for those kids out there, we shouldn’t be trying to take anything away from them…<br><br>Anderson: A lot of people said the same thing about Thomas Jefferson High when they kicked them out of the playoffs before they began. Look, John, I don’t want to rain on anyone’s parade, but the fact is that Whittier didn’t qualify. They didn’t win enough games. They only got a chance at all because the Thomas Jefferson Democrats—best record in the league, by and by—were—<br><br>Morgan: Look, Andy, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. I’m the most tolerant person in this shop, but we both know that it’s long been established that—<br><br>Anderson: You’re not supposed to include the coloreds? Who let them in the league in the first place? These schools thought they would be an easy win, so they opened it up. But they weren’t. They won. You can’t change the rules after the fact, especially when the one who benefits is a crew that, let’s be honest, never really—<br><br>Morgan: Sorry, Andy, I’m gonna have to cut you off. The Cardinals are about to take the field to end this sucker, and if you wouldn’t look at who’s going out to take the knee. That’s not the starting quarterback. It’s that senior, number 12! <br><br>Anderson: Oh, my lord…<br><br>Morgan: If I’m not mistaken, this is the first time in his four years that he’s ever come out on the field. You were talking about him with me earlier, right? He’s that second-string player. Never lettered. Never even started a game. Still went to practice every darn day. They said he was the most spirited warmer on the team. Now, if this isn’t a special moment.<br><br>Anderson: It’s, really. It’s, just…<br><br>Morgan: Andy?<br><br>Anderson: This is just…it’s so sad.<br><br>

That's their left tackle, Paul Sweeney. He just got Sweeney goin' back, and then he just he came right off of him, and made the, made the sack on Logue. If he doesn't watch out, he's gonna be the Los Angeles County defensive player of the week.<p>Anderson: Maybe of the year.<p>Morgan: Yeah, because when you get numbers like that, you know, and that's what every defensive lineman wants is, is numbers. And of course you get the sack numbers. But then, when you get the interception numbers, and the interception for a return numbers, now you're talkin' numbers, now you're talkin', you got some numbers.<p>Anderson: Whittier just took a timeout, stopped the clock. The Cardinals better hope they can pin ‘em back hard. Remember, because of the tiebreaker, Whitter needs to win if they’re going to advance. Harvard-Westlake doesn’t need to. They can tie and still move on, and they’re only down by three.<p>Morgan: Tommy Petty, back to punt. And he's done well against the wind. He goes, and… they blocked him! Harvard gets the ball at the 20!<p>…<p><p>Anderson: And… good! With time expired, that’s your final score: 10 Whittier, 10 Harvard. The Wolverines advance with the tiebreaker, and the Cardinals, for another year, see their season end early.<p>Morgan: The Cardinals put up more of a fight than I think anyone expected, but, in the end, it just wasn’t enough. It’s really gotta be a heartbreaker for those seniors, you know, even the ones you don’t see play. <p>Anderson: Speaking of that, I heard about one guy, number 12. Second-string player. Never lettered. Never even started a game. Still went to practice every darn day. They said he was the most spirited warmer on the team. You don’t see guys like that at Harvard.<p>Morgan: You sure as heck don’t, John.

Even the press is going easy on them, probably because of the talks in Paris, sure, but still..”<br><br>Major Anderson shrugged wearily before taking another sip from his flask. The younger man’s foot rapped against the carpet.<br><br>“I guess that’ll change once they hear about this. But he’s gotta sign off on it first.

After a moment lost in thought, the man sighed. "No escaping it. Why don't I just show you?"<br><br>The two officers milled through the empty White House halls. Most younger staffers worked out of EOB, the campaign headquarters was still packing things up, and it was now late into the evening when most high-level appointees had gone home.

Peering around the corner of the hallway, the Major quickly pulled back, looking at the Lieutenant and mouthing “back there.” The Lieutenant swallowed inched around the corner to get a look for himself.<br><br>“We had the bastards on the run, I tell you. They just wouldn’t let us take our gloves off, get into the arena. Goddamn spineless sons-of-bitches.”<br><br>The president paced back and forth, nursing a bottle of brandy, but never treading far.

These rags, the bastards, they make up all these lies…saying I drove Buddy around with other men before she said yes. It’s the filthiest goddamn thing!”<br><br>The president had his head in his hands, leaning against the wall, a bottle of brandy propped upright by the nearest door. Nixon could not bear to look into the eyes of the man he was weeping to.<br><br>“Goddammit, so what if I did?! So what if I did drive her around to other men’s doors, stealing glances from the mirror of those worthless snobs fondling her in the driveway? In the end, she said yes, didn’t she?<br><br>He was pacing back and forth now, growling, getting red in the face.<br><br>“She never understood it…never, the men of the arena,” the president let out his mirth. “No no, Buddy, not Buddy…in ‘60, back when it was goddamn stolen from me, she wanted to leave me. Dick Nixon, not good enough for her, oh no, then in ‘62, in California, even those bastard liberals wouldn’t stomach DIck Nixon would they?! She tried to leave then too…”<br><br>The president stopped his nervous pacing, his hands falling down by his sides, simply gazing up.<br><br>“Sometimes…” he trailed off, at a much softer pitch. “Sometimes, you just…lose it, right? They don’t understand you and you just…can’t help it. Were you ever like that, Jack?”<br><br>The portrait of John F. Kennedy, the slain king, stared down at his peer in disgust.

He looked upward again.<br><br>“But you know what got us through those times, Jack? Those times you stole it from us? You and your goddamn brother? We did it again. We ran. And we kept running. And we didn’t stop until victory was secured.”<br><br>Nixon was now back upright, glaring at the portrait hanging on the wall. <br><br>“If those bastards think they’ve seen the last of Dick Nixon…we’ll crush them in ‘76, we’ll gut them like animals, we’ll tear them limb from-”<br><br>“Mr. President?”<br><br>Nixon whirled around. Lieutenant Morgan leaped backwards behind the corner, white as a ghost, Major Anderson barely suppressing his laugh. The Chief of Staff cleared his throat once more, still standing in the doorway down the hall, knuckles tapping the walls.<br><br>“Your meeting with the Air Force team regarding the strike on those targets in Laos, Mr. President. They’re ready to see you now.”<br><br>

                “Must have been pretty grim here the past month, right?” <br><br>Major Anderson nodded wearily, “It’s worse than it’s made out to be.”<br><br>“Thought so…” muttered Lieutenant Morgan. “Those hippies outside still won’t let up either. Can’t give the poor guy a break even after all that. Screaming about the bombings and all that. Hell, they’re gonna get a lot louder once this makes the news.”<br><br>Major Anderson shook his head before taking another sip from his flask. The younger man checked his watch, growing impatient.<br><br>“I know he’s probably still miserable over the thing, hell, I would be too if the whole country rejected me like that. But we’ve still got this strike to approve. They’re practically on the runway over in Guam. We gotta get his sign-off tonight, everyone’s waiting.”<br><br>The older man held up his hands. "I get it, all I’m saying is, you gotta be patient with him these days. He’s probably deep in conversation with…actually, why don’t I just show you?"<br><br>Lieutenant Morgan looked at his superior baffled by where this was going, as Major Anderson motioned for him to follow him out of the room. The two officers wormed their way through the empty White House halls. Most younger staffers worked out of EOB, the campaign headquarters was still packing up, and it was now late into the evening when most high-level appointees had gone home. Only the Secret Service were visible. Ascending several flights of stairs and navigating through the darkened, narrow hallways, the young man felt winded finding his way around the labyrinthian building. <br><br>“Hey, what’s that so—.”<br><br>The elder man held his hand up and turned around to make a soft shhh noise. Peering around the corner of the hallway, the Major quickly pulled back, looking at the Lieutenant and mouthing “back there.” Morgan thought he heard what sounded like a dog crying. The Lieutenant took a peek around the corner to get a look for himself.<br><br>“They never talked about you and her like that…never, never. These rags, the bastards, they make up all these lies…saying I drove Buddy around with other men before she said yes. It’s the filthiest goddamn thing!”<br><br>The president had his head in his hands, leaning against the wall, a bottle of brandy propped upright by the nearest door. Nixon could not bear to look into the eyes of the man he was weeping to.<br><br>“Goddammit, so what if I did?! So what if I did drive her around to other men’s doors, stealing glances from the mirror of those worthless snobs fondling her in the driveway? In the end, she said yes, didn’t she?<br><br>He was pacing back and forth now, growling, getting red in the face.<br><br>“She never understood it…never, the men of the arena,” the president let out his mirth. “No no, Buddy, not Buddy…in ‘60, back when it was goddamn stolen from me, she wanted to leave me. Dick Nixon, not good enough for her, oh no, then in ‘62, in California, even those bastard liberals wouldn’t stomach DIck Nixon would they?! She tried to leave then too…”<br><br>The president stopped his nervous pacing, his hands falling down by his sides, simply gazing up.<br><br>“Sometimes…” he trailed off, at a much softer pitch. “Sometimes, you just…lose it, right? They don’t understand you and you just…can’t help it. Were you ever like that, Jack?”<br><br>The portrait of John F. Kennedy, the slain king, stared down at his peer in disgust. The former president couldn’t even look Nixon in the eyes, averting his gaze, his arms folded in shame. <br><br>“No, no, of course not…of course you wouldn’t…I’m sorry, I just…lose myself sometimes-”<br><br>The bottle splashed over, Nixon swore, crouching down to pick it up, using his suit jacket to mop up the mess.

                “Must have been pretty painful around here.” <br><br>Major Anderson took a drink, “You could say that.”<br><br>“I mean, Jesus, do you think he ever considered…” Lieutenant Morgan began in hushed tones, leaning forward.<br><br>“You mean…?” Major Anderson queried, eyes squinting, before firmly shaking his head. “No, no chance.”<br><br>The younger man shrugged, then checked his watch, growing impatient.<br><br>“Look, I have no doubt he’s barely holding up over that, it’s been a rough few weeks, I understand. But he’s only got a month or so until this is all over. Why doesn’t he just come out? We’ve been waiting here nearly an hour and DoD wants this approved before midnight. They’re waiting for us over in Guam for this!”<br><br>The older man waved him off. "I know, I know. But there’s a schedule to these things. Usually the meeting begins around 11:00, but right now he’s…well, you can see for yourself."<br><br>Lieutenant Morgan got out of his seat and took a look down the hall, seeing nothing. The older officer motioned to Anderson to follow him. The two men wormed their way through the empty White House halls. Most younger staffers worked out of EOB, the campaign headquarters was still packing up, and it was now late into the evening when most high-level appointees had gone home. Only the Secret Service were visible. Ascending several flights of stairs and navigating through the darkened, narrow hallways, the young man felt winded finding his way around the labyrinthian building. <br><br>“Christ, Major, I thought you said he was—.”<br><br>The elder man stopped dead in his tracks, waving his hand behind his back to silence Anderson. Peering around the corner of the hallway, the Major quickly pulled back, breathing in sharply. The Lieutenant took a peek around the corner to get a look for himself.<br><br>“And you know the worst goddamn thing is that everyone knows it…when you move a society in that direction, with the Romans and the Greeks, when they lose their vitality, it’s because of their decline in values, in morals…produces weak men.”<br><br>The president stood still, looking straight into the eyes of his conversation partner, his gaze never wavering.<br><br>“Once the American people start valuing weakness…losing these masculine ideals, well, then it all goes away. We need strong leaders, tough men…not this, this…forget it…”<br><br>The president staggered over to where he left his bottle of brandy on the floor, propped up against the wall, and he began to drink.<br><br>“You know what the Chinese word for crisis is? It’s…it’s, well, Christ, the word itself doesn’t matter, but it means ‘danger’ and ‘opportunity.’ Think about that. There’s always a risk, always, heh, always a gamble. But it can pay off, you get it?”<br><br>Growing agitated, the president set his drink back down, spilling it over the carpet mindlessly, next to the other stains, but he droned on.<br><br>“Ike, the dumb son-of-a-bitch, useless bastard, he never understood it. Never. Back with Hungary, he dithered. Got all that praise, all that war hero crap with the Suez business. He didn’t deserve one goddamn bit of it, not after what he pulled with those few damned rocks that we nearly went to war with China over. Or in Korea, remember that? MacArthur, now there was a man, a man with real class…you ever meet him? You probably did, during the Cuba business, I bet he told you to, heh, to just drop a bomb on the place, right Jack?”<br><br>Kennedy remained silent, his head still bowed down, gaze fixed on the stain Nixon was now treading on, as the president began pouring himself another drink. <br><br>“That was your error, your fatal one. You blinked. Not with the Soviets…no, no, no, they didn’t give a damn about some funny little island in the Caribbean. You blinked with the maniacs in the basement, the ones we keep locked up. They smelled blood, they knew you didn’t have it in you, so they bite. You can’t let them do that to you, Jack. I won;t…real leaders don’t. You have to be the one to do it yourself. Truman didn’t wait, did he? Every speech at the funeral praised him for being the one to do it, the one to press the…”<br><br>The bottle slipped from Nixon’s grasp again, bouncing off the carpet, spilling brandy all over the floor. <br><br>“Mr. President—.”<br><br>“No time for that,” Nixon shouted as he whirled around. Lieutenant Morgan leaped backwards behind the corner, white as a ghost, Major Anderson barely suppressing his own horror. <br><br>Flustered, the White House Chief of Staff gathered himself before trying to ask again.<br><br>“Mr. President, what, what do you mean? The briefing on those strikes in Cambodia, I thought you sai-”<br><br>“Fuck ‘em. Cancel it, I don’t give a shit. Get me the Joint Chiefs. Tell them I need to see them here at once, national emergency, give ‘em that crap.”<br><br>Nixon marched into the room opposite Jack’s portrait, about to slam the door before stopping to bark one last order at his Chief of Staff.<br><br>“Oh and uh, grab that young fellow, the Marine, whatever, the one with the big briefcase upstairs. Bring him down here, I want to speak with him.”<br><br>Slamming the door shut, the White House phone lines glowed to life, and Kennedy remained still.<br><br>

            </h3>
            DATE: MAY 1, 1973 <br><br>FROM: ████████████████████ <br><br>SUBJECT: THE DEATH OF RICHARD NIXON <br><br>NOTES ON THE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHOSE YEARS OF FIERCE REPRESSION AND MALADMINISTRATION HAVE BROUGHT RUIN TO A NATION <br><br>WASHINGTON, DC—U.S. service members swear an oath to “support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.”  <br><br>On May 1, 1973, the US Department of the Army joined with the American citizens to fulfill this pledge and guarantee the Constitutional processes of the nation. In the early hours of the morning, the US armed forces participated in an operation to retake control of the White House and US Capitol Complex.  <br><br>The operation brings to an end the despotic reign of Richard M. Nixon, aged 60. Richard Nixon was a former US president and one of the country’s most durable figures. His government was enabled by years of repression and long-simmering national rage. He demanded slavish subservience at home and abroad and engaged in criminal, coercive acts that undermined the country’s sacred democratic processes. <br><br>In a memo signed yesterday, the Acting Secretary of the Army joined with other Joint Chiefs in declaring that Nixon’s activities “were inconsistent with the rule of law” and constituted “sedition and insurrection.” It was only after a 24-hour deadline that officials acted to preserve the country’s traditions and values. <br><br>The Acting Secretary of the Army honors the bravery of the service men who remained true to their oaths amid this crisis. He extends his heartfelt thanks to the American people, who stood as one to oppose the tyrant whose charges include subversion of the national economy, embezzlement, racketeering, armed attack on the people, destruction of buildings and state institutions, subversion of congressional authority, election interference, and genocide.  <br><br>In coordination with relevant state authorities, the Acting Secretary is involved in continued operations to restore order and ensure a seamless transfer of power to civilian governance. A variety of individuals have been released from unlawful incarceration—Al Haig, Allard Lowenstein, Alexander Barkan, Charles Dyson, Daniel Schorr, Howard Stein, Hunter Thompson, Leonard Woodcock, Morton Halperin, and Mary McGrory.  <br><br>Members of the regime—including principal enablers H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John Mitchell—have been detained. They will face prosecution for their misdeeds. We urge every American to lay down their arms. Now is the time not for recriminations but reconciliation.  <br><br>A brief statement from the Pentagon follows: <br><br>“Almost two hundred years ago, the United States planted the tree of liberty. Today, we have refreshed it. From the crucible of this event, our nation will emerge stronger than ever. We will move past this calamity. Our long national nightmare is over.” <br><br>

            </h3>
            <i>The Fatigue Press, December 1972</i><br><br>On Wednesday, November 8, 1972, at approximately 8:00 p.m., First Sergeant Williams and the C.O. entered room 265 of the 397th Signal Company and found its occupant dead in the closet. <br><br>Pfc Bruce Dellums was a native of Fresno, California. He was found hanging from a rope from his alert-readiness pack in his locker. From the appearance of his body, it was clear he had been hanging there for at least a day. His disappearance was not noticed because of Election Night hub-bub. <br><br>People who knew Bruce say he was in a bad state. He had been relieved of his job as a switchboard operator. He had faced disciplinary action for telling a captain that he’d “frag the guy” if sent to Vietnam. He was hoping for a discharge that never came. <br><br>No one knows what exactly drove the guy to do it. All we in The Fatigue Press have are rumors and the few stories that his friends have been willing to tell. The story that emerges is of a guy that had many problems, personal and Army-related. He probably had no business being in the Army at all. But here’s what we know: <br>1. Bruce had a drinking problem and had wracked up a $400.00 tab at a local bar. <br>2. He was likely homosexual and had been beaten up by his roommate for making sexual advances. <br>3. He had briefly been under psychiatric observation, only for the base psychiatrist to diagnose him with mild depression and declare him “fit for duty”. <br>4. The night before the Election, he told one of his few friends that the “country’s going to hell” and he didn’t think the war would ever really end if “Nixon got his rocks off” as predicted. <br>The Army’s been all too keen to shove Dellums under the rug, as it has with every other dead kid. They’re all the same to the bosses. Here’s just one more fuck-up. Here’s one more body. Sweep him aside. Slap a flag on him. Throw him in the ground. They don’t care that he suffered. Their idea of an official explanation is a three-sentence story in the backpages of Stars and Stripes. Two-word headline. “Body Found.” <br><br>The CID will give us an investigation but they’ll ask the wrong questions. They won’t ask what kind of person he was. They won’t care that he liked to paint flowers and was a fiend for music. They won’t ask why someone so young felt the world was so hopeless, why he felt so sure that there was no future after this Election, why his one attempt to get help led to Army psychiatrists shooting him up with tranquilizers, why no one even noticed he was gone for hours after he’d hung himself in his locker.  <br><br>They won’t mention that what happened to Bruce was the product of a system that views all men as interchangeable and disposable. That he was just another poor kid drafted to enable some politician’s international pissing contest. That he had no interest in massacring poor Vietnamese kids because some big-wig said so. They certainly won’t mention the Army’s institutionalized, prejudice against homosexuals, trouble-makers, and fuck-ups. Instead they’ll tell themselves that he was a lost cause and that it was no one’s fault that a flower they ripped from the garden started to wilt. <br><br>After all, it’s time for the country to come together. It’s time we think about the people whose suffering really matters—the politicians who got us into this mess. <br><br>If even the most basic concern had been invested in Bruce, could he have been saved? I don’t know. It’s easy for the bosses to dope people up on pills, to fire them and give them a new job. It’s easy too for them to make someone the object of jokes and abuse.  <br><br>Bruce was a homosexual and that was funny. He liked to sing and talked funny and that was funny. He committed suicide and that was funny to them too. <br><br>Maybe only a few select men in this country are deserving of an honorable death. Maybe the only way to get a lick of respect in this country is to go out like Richard Nixon, by getting elected president and then blowing your brains out all over the Oval Office because of the suffering you’ve inflicted on a million other people. <br><br>And if that’s what it takes, this country doesn’t deserve all the sympathy being lavished on it. <br><br>We don’t deserve to be a country at all. <br><br>

                </h3>
                <i>While Richard Nixon initially succeeded in his efforts to thwart America’s democratic processes, his efforts also sowed the seeds of his defeat. Spurred by the arrests of his political rivals, his declaration of a national emergency, and attempted cancellation of the 1972 presidential election, many brave men and women took to the streets to protest the would-be regime with support from state and local officials. Escalating violence against these protestors—including the shooting of some 80 unarmed youth in LaFayette Plaza—turned increasing numbers of Americans against the Nixon government.</i><br><br><i>By May 1973, the situation had become untenable for the president and his supporters. As military leaders ceased their efforts to defend Washington and various cabinet members fled for Latin America, the president found himself alone, surrounded by hostile governors and national guard forces. He issued several final broadcasts to the nation over television and radio—though breakdowns in federal telecommunications infrastructure ensured that these messages reached only a handful of public broadcast stations. </i><br><br><i>The deaths of the Nixon government’s principal actors and the intentional destruction of many tapes, files, and other documents make these broadcasts the clearest record of Richard Nixon’s state in his final days. The US Center for the Second Constitution and the Edward M. Kennedy Memorial Library present these broadcasts in their original format. </i><br><br><i>Transcripts are available on the nearby wall for the hearing impaired.</i><br><br>Good evening.<br><br>My fellow Americans, my fellow citizens,<br><br>My Americans.<br><br>This is the 49th time I have spoken to you from this office, where so many important decisions have been made. This is the office where Lincoln conducted his war against the Confederacy, where Wilson and Roosevelt fought to preserve our freedom, where John F. Kennedy faced off against the Soviet Union. I have tried to act as they have. I have tried to act as they have to—. To—.<br><br>I truly believe… I do believe… I have acted in the national interest. I have acted to preserve the Union from the anarchists, the criminal elements who would tear down our Republic to its foundations. Across the nation there are insurrectionists—. S-subversives. They would extinguish the torch of…<br><br>[Rustling of papers]<br><br>Let’s put that aside. You’ve heard enough uhh… well-prepared remarks from speechwriters, media men, what have you. But what you haven’t heard—. What you haven’t heard is my own personal reflections on this great crisis that we face. <br><br>I am not a sentimental man, but what I tell you now is from the heart. It’s my, my great outpouring. It’s—. <br><br>[Chuckling. Rustling of papers.]<br><br>As many know, I was raised by a strong Midwestern woman who instilled in me certain qualities. The most important of these is a certain coolness. The… The tougher it gets, the cooler I get. I excel under pressure. Like Lincoln. Like Lincoln over one hundred years ago defended this nation from dissolution and ruin so too… So too… I am stronger than ever… I possess a— a— firmness, the resolve to continue this great battle… A fortitude…<br><br>I know it does not seem like it now, but rest assured that we are on the precipice. We are on the precipice of a great victory. The greatest victory in American history. Maybe all mankind. Our enemies don’t understand it, but I do. We both do. <br><br>We’ve sacrificed everything for this moment and we won’t go down like the Romanovs. Not like a dog. Never like a dog. On our own terms. We’ve fought too hard for that. <br><br>God, if my mother could see… <br><br>[Clearing throat]<br><br>Rest assured that I am in constant communication with the Joint Chiefs, with our allies, with your governors and representatives. Our armed forces remain as powerful and united as ever. Events in, uhh, Vietnam notwithstanding, we are the greatest military force on earth. We can still come together. We can, as our forefathers did, sacrifice for the greater good. <br><br>I call upon all Americans to recognize this, to… compromise and lay down their arms. <br><br>For my part, I will carry it through to the finish regardless of whatever personal agony it will involve. I will remain in this Office, as your president, to ensure that the interests of the Nation are upheld. When this violence ends, when this battle is complete, I am confident that we will be able to return to the normal business of government. We will see a restoration of the prosperity which has eluded us for so many years. <br><br>We will ensure there is no more pain.<br><br>We will achieve peace with honor. <br><br>May God’s grace be with you all in the days ahead.<br><br>[End of Recording]<br><br>

                <i>“When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”</i><br><br><i>When former President Richard Nixon said these words to British journalist David Frost in 1977, most Americans saw them as tantamount to a confession of guilt about the Watergate scandal, which had consumed his presidency and drove him from office in disgrace three years prior. But the entire context of these remarks must be read in full to understand the president’s meaning. The questions Frost posed to Mr. Nixon were <b>not</b> in reference to the Watergate burglaries of June 1972 or the subsequent cover-up. They were narrowly focused on the unconstitutional “Huston Plan” of 1970, which proposed giving U.S. intelligence agencies expansive new powers to trample on civil liberties at home, in effect creating a secret police.</i><br><br><i>This form of lawbreaking by law enforcement was not unique to the Nixon years. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI epitomized that spirit of total disregard for Americans’ constitutional rights, so long as their dismissal served the aims of a wider ideological war, at the time against communists. The targets shifted somewhat in the Nixon presidency, away from the old left’s Red Guard, and towards the youth-led antiwar movement and its more radical fringes, namely the Weather Underground, which committed numerous acts of senseless violence during the late 60’s and early 70’s. </i><br><br><i>The most important was perhaps the Greenwich townhouse explosion on March 6, 1970, when the Weather Underground’s amateur bomb-making blew back in their face, killing three of their own cadres and leveling an apartment building. It beggars belief that the United States government was at risk of being overthrown by these wannabe radicals, as Richard Nixon claimed in order to ram through the Huston Plan. The Weather Underground’s worst enemy was itself.</i><br><br><i>But the target of Nixon’s wrath was never the point. A deeply paranoid and vindictive man, his enemies included schoolboy rivals, New Deal bureaucrats, the Kennedy family, the press, and liberals at large. Watergate or the Huston Plan were not isolated incidents, they were a way of life in the Nixon administration, in which time the country saw the rise of the imperial presidency and its abuse of the vast powers that Cold War intelligence agencies placed in its lap. </i><br><br><i>With the savage war in Vietnam prolonged for another four years, between 1969 and 1973, the war was brought home, with the types of counterinsurgency tactics first used in the rice paddies of Indochina brought to American streets. In the mid-70’s, the last gasp of these radical groups were decimated in violent battles, like the May 1974 shootout that destroyed the Symbionese Liberation Army. The police officers doing the shooting were largely Vietnam veterans using surplus military hardware to execute the same search-and-destroy operations they had conducted overseas. </i><br><br><i>The pattern of militarization abroad leading to militarization at home has been a constant of American history. The ubiquitousness of SWAT teams came from Vietnam. Excess military hardware generated for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were then distributed to small town cops under the 1033 Program. Expansive powers for immigration enforcement generated at the height of War on Terror hysteria are now being used to imprison dissenters of further American-backed wars abroad. </i><br><br><i>Richard Nixon hastened the rise of empire at home, and we will all pay the price for the silence of his fiercest critics to seriously challenge the symbiotic relation between Watergate and Vietnam. When Congressman John Conyers (D-MI) introduced an article of impeachment against Richard Nixon—along with the agreed-upon counts of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress—for his illegal bombing of Cambodia, in which he lied to the American people and Congress about this war of aggression for years, it was shot down. Nine Democrats broke party lines to join Republicans and defeat the Cambodia amendment, including antiwar bleeding-heart liberals like Peter Rodino. Reflecting on the failed push for Congress to reassert its constitutional war powers, Conyers stated “condemning the Cambodian bombing would also have required us to indict <b>previous administrations</b> and to admit that the Congress has failed to fully meet its own constitutional obligations.”</i><br><br><i>Put simply, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.</i><br><br>FROST: You called a meeting on June the fifth, 1970, about the Huston plan and eventually approved it in July. It got your okay on July the fourteenth, didn’t it? And in the Huston plan it stated very clearly, with reference to the entry that was being proposed, it said very clearly, use of this technique is clearly illegal, it amounts to burglary … however, it is also one of the most fruitful tools and it can produce the type of intelligence which cannot be obtained in any other fashion. Why did you approve a plan that included an element like that … that was clearly illegal?<br><br>NIXON: Because as president of the United States … ah … I had to make a decision, as has faced most presidents, in fact, all of them, ah … in which, ah … the national security in terms of a threat from abroad, ah … and the security of the individual … individual violence at home had to be put first. Ah … I think Abraham Lincoln has stated it better than anybody else, as he does in so many cases. When he said, “Must a government be too strong for the liberties of its people? Or too weak to defend or maintain its own existence?” That’s the dilemma that presidents have had to face, ah … Roosevelt had to face it in World War II. Truman and Eisenhower in the Cold War period. Kennedy and Johnson as Vietnam began to come in. And Kennedy, of course, even before Vietnam began to escalate, had the beginning of the violent racial disturbances … ah … which led to some activities in this category. Now let’s first, let’s second understand what the surreptitious entry is limited to. You will note that a surreptitious entry in cases involving national security and specifically mentions, ah … two, ah … groups of, ah … internal organizations who had no foreign connections as far as we know. Ah … the Weathermen and the Black Panthers.<br><br>Now, why were we concerned? Let’s look at the year, 1970. We had a situation where thirty-five thousand people, ah … had been victims of assaults. A number of them had been killed. It was a year in which we had, ah … sixteen airplane hijackings. There had been about eleven the year before. Ah … but most significantly, it was a year in which there had been thirty thousand bombings and fifty thousand …I mean, sorry, three thousands bombings, three thousand bombings and fifty thousand bomb threats … which caused, ah … the evacuation of buildings. Ah… it was a year of turbulence in American society. Ah … ’‘68 … ’69 … ’70 … the residue of the terrible period of ’68. Washing over into ’69 and continued through ’70 and then, thank God, began to go down in ’71 and ’72, when calm was restored to the campuses. The cities did cease to be burned, and bombings did go down. And while we’ve argued about our crime statistics, where at least in ’72 there was a decrease rather than an increase. Alright, now, now in 1970, in the middle of 1970, ah … we were faced with a situation here, first, where the intelligence agencies weren’t working together. Ah … there were CIA … was not speaking to the FBI … the NSA, the National Security Agency, which of course does all of our [cryptographic] work. That’s the highly sensitive, technical work, you know, to break codes and that sort of thing … had very little communication with the other two. Ah … under the circumstances I felt that we had to coordinate these activities and get a more effective program for dealing with, first, foreign-directed, ah … espionage, ah … or foreign-supported, ah… subversion. And in addition with domestic groups that used and advocated violence… .<br><br>FROST: So, what in a sense you’re saying is that there are certain situations and the Huston plan or that part of it was one of them where the president can decide that it’s in the best interest of the nation or something and do something illegal.<br><br>NIXON: <b>Well, when the president does it … that means that it is not illegal.</b><br><br>FROST: By definition –<br><br>NIXON: Exactly … exactly… if the president … if, for example, the president approves something … approves an action, ah … because of the national security or in this case because of a threat to internal peace and order of, ah … ah … significant magnitude … then … the president’s decision in that instance is one, ah … that enables those who carry it out to carry it out without violating a law. Otherwise they’re in an impossible position.<br><br>FROST: So that the black-bag jobs that were authorized in the Huston plan … if they’d gone ahead, would have been made legal by your action?<br><br>NIXON: Well … I think that we would … I think that we’re splitting hairs here. Burglaries per se are illegal. Let’s begin with that proposition. Second, when a burglary, as you have described a black-bag job, ah … when a burglary, ah … is one that is undertaken because of an expressed policy decided by the president, ah … in the interests of the national security … or in the interests of domestic tranquility … ah … when those interests are very, very high … and when the device will be used in a very limited and cautious manner and responsible manner … when it is undertaken, then, then that means that what would otherwise be technically illegal does not subject those who engage in such activity to criminal prosecution. That’s the way I would put it. Now, that isn’t trying to split hairs … but I do not mean to suggest the president is above the law … what I am suggesting, however, what we have to understand, is, in wartime particularly, war abroad, and virtually revolution in certain concentrated areas at home, that a president does have under the Constitution extraordinary powers and must exert them with … as little as possible. . . .

                <i>On October 6, 1973, at 2:00pm Cairo time, Egypt and Syria’s militaries launched a coordinated assault on Israeli forces in the Golan Heights and the Sinai. While the attack came as a shock to Israeli intelligence and the world at large, it was not entirely unanticipated, as this series in the National Security Archive’s retrospective on the conflict shows.</i><br><br> <i>The conversation below between President Nixon and H.R. Haldeman concern what they call “tensions in the region,” which is discussed as a prelude to war. Notably, these diplomatic preparations for the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East excluded regional partners, and were carried out through what Nixon and Kissinger liked to call “shuttle diplomacy” in his first term. But since re-election, Nixon largely neglected that tactic, instead preferring decisive military action. </i><br><br> <i>The Middle East was one area where this was not true, where President Nixon still deferred to private diplomacy conducted by informal “mediators” behind closed door, as the actions by William Simon in late 1973 and early 1974 demonstrate. But there is another, largely forgotten episode, when the U.S. received indications that Egypt and Syria were preparing for war, and Nixon considered sending an envoy. Below is an excerpt of one such conversation.</i><br><br> NIXON: I had a couple of thoughts on how we could approach the business with the Israelis. Do we have an envoy of sorts that we could send? It seems to me that there’s a hell of a lot of pressure on us to “do something” there to cool matters down in the region. How about Nelson?<br><br> HALDEMAN: I don’t think so.<br><br> NIXON: Can’t do it? <br><br> HALDEMAN: Henry would say he’s not disciplined enough.<br><br> NIXON: It would certainly make him happy to make him think he’s being useful, though I suspect the threats of war there would destroy the poor bastard.<br><br> HALDEMAN: How about Bush?<br><br> NIXON: God, no. Too soft. Not sophisticated. Would send absolutely the wrong signal.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Could rid ourselves of Haig.<br><br> NIXON: Tough bastard. Would drive State up the wall, but he has a tendency to run his mouth. Some useful idiot could—.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Lindsay?<br><br> NIXON: Jesus. You’re not—.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Play the whole bipartisan angle.<br><br> NIXON: I was trying to think of somebody with a title. What the hell is he even doing now? Writing another book?<br><br> HALDEMAN: I—.<br><br> NIXON: My God, forget how he let Nader walk all over him. Look at how he ran New York. Look at the whole episode with the Saudis back in… ‘68?

                <i>In his second term, Richard Nixon faced a variety of economic and geopolitical challenges. In this call, recorded in June 1974, the president discusses his difficulties in managing the crisis in the Middle East.</i><br><br>SIMON: In effect, Mr. President, the cooldown we had hoped would materialize in the second half of the year isn’t happening. All the benchmark goals that have to be met for our inflation target keep shifting.<br><br> NIXON: Christ.<br><br> SIMON: And if this keeps getting any higher, we might reach 7% by the end of ‘74.<br><br> NIXON: That bad, huh?<br><br> SIMON: Well, Mr. President, it could always get worse. I mean, uh, we have these figures here, let me find them, here it is: in the nonfarm sector of the economy, productivity keeps falling.<br><br> NIXON: Bunch of bums.<br><br> SIMON: Well it’s more that, uh, this is putting a lot of pressure on prices. Incidentally, gas prices keep rising.<br><br> NIXON: Goddammit, you told me those would fall!<br><br> SIMON: Sir, all of our economists sincerely thought that would happen, and I’m sorry, but they’re going to keep rising throughout the summer.<br><br> NIXON: Burns, that son-of-a-bitch, it’s all his damn fault.<br><br> SIMON: Well, I can tell you this, Mr. President, if we work out an agreement with Riyadh, perhaps in exchange for further weapons sales, well, they might be able to drive those gas prices down.<br><br> NIXON: Hm.<br><br> SIMON: We, uh, talked about something like that during the energy crisis last year, after the embargo and all that. <br><br> NIXON: Right.<br><br> SIMON: The good news is, of course, that we averted global economic depression there. I mean, don’t take that for granted, it really looked like we could have had a total systematic meltdown there, and it didn’t happen.<br><br> NIXON: The press never gives me credit for it.<br><br> SIMON: No, sir, they don’t. But my point is that every economist thought that gas prices would fall after that, but they haven’t, and now I think we need to try, ah, more creative solutions. One that has come across my desk might interest you…<br><br> NIXON: Go on.<br><br> SIMON: Alright, well essentially, we convince the Saudis—likely through greater weapons sales—to invest some of their enormous oil profits into uh, U.S. treasury bonds, our debt, essentially. Now, they’d buy these bonds outside of normal markets, in secret, if they want, but the effect would be to recycle their petrodollars into our economy, which would plug the deficit, bring down oil prices, and hey, maybe even bring peace to the Middle East while we’re at it. Now, it’s highly risky, which is why I wanted to see you. Do you approve of this plan?<br><br> NIXON: I don’t give a shit. Fine. Do it. Who even gives a shit about the goddamn Saudis anyway?<br><br> SIMON: Well sir, that’s, uh, part of the problem. It’s—actually, it’s a little funny, kind of, er, complicated—<br><br> NIXON: Spit it out, Christ.<br><br> SIMON: Sorry, right. The arms sales would have to go through Congress. <br><br> NIXON: Right.<br><br> SIMON: And our, uh, military assistance to the Saudis, is upsetting our other allies in the region.<br><br> NIXON: The Israelis?<br><br> SIMON: That’s right, sir.<br><br> NIXON: Un-goddamn-believable. You part the Red Sea once a thousand years ago and think you can do anything.<br><br> SIMON: It’s, uh, unfortunate sir.<br><br> NIXON: Alright, so the sons-of-bitches are crying about it, they want their military edge, fine. But what does that matter? Tune ‘em out.<br><br> SIMON: Frankly, Mr. President, I’d love to, but their friends in Congress are giving us a hard time.<br><br> NIXON: Jackson, isn’t it? Well, we can work him, the bastard. Incidentally, he doesn’t give a shit about all this Watergate business. Doesn’t seem to give a damn about impeachment or any of it.<br><br> SIMON: Right, and uh, no it’s not Jackson, uh…well there’s no nice way to say this, but it’s Muskie sir.<br><br> NIXON: What? Muskie? What the hell does he care about Israel for?<br><br> SIMON: Well…it seems that some of the tactics the, uh, Committee to Re-Elect used in ‘72 to, uh, push down the ethnic vote, er, scared him.<br><br> NIXON: What?<br><br> SIMON: In effect, sir, Muskie’s trying to protect his own flank, so he’s been meeting with a lot of Jewish groups lately, community organizers, that sort of thing, and he’s trying to rebrand as this, uh, great friend of Israel. So he’s holding up our arms shipments to the Saudis because of it.<br><br> NIXON: We should have just called him a fairy and called it a day.<br><br>

This victory generated questions among power brokers in both parties about the kind of messages they wanted to advance and the voting groups they needed to appeal to. While clashes between pro- and anti-integrationist candidates defined the Democratic Party’s struggles through the 1970s, a very different conversation was taking place in Republican circles. This recording of a conversation between President Richard Nixon, FBI Director Gray, and White House Advisor John Ehrlichman from January 1974 reflects the tenor of these discussions and the White House’s approach to growing instances of political violence across the shifting South.</i><br><br>NIXON: —has to do with national security. They’re a hell of a lot of people, these violent groups. <br><br>GRAY: Mm-hmm.<br><br>NIXON: Terrorists, if you will. Allowed to fester by prior governments.

It’s always complaints about, uh, not getting enough pay or, uh, these arrests. Not being heard. And we can make the occasional gesture, invite them to a few meetings, shake some hands, but they expect you to keep at it when there’s a dozen other goddamn groups to consider. I mean, I wouldn’t be where I was today if I didn’t make an appeal to, uh, certain interests in ‘68.<br><br>GRAY: Sir, I understand what you’re saying, but this could be an opportunity. With Wallace and his disciplines running the Democrats, there’s a real sense of disillusionment, particularly among young Blacks.

                <i>The defeat of Senator Ted Kennedy in 1972 contributed to what H.R. Haldeman would later describe as “a sense of invulnerability" among Nixon White House aides. Democrats had thrown their best candidate against Nixon. They had enjoyed the benefit of a flagging economy, an uncertain global situation, the specter of scandal. Still, they had fallen short—a result that officials believed represented a repudiation of Democratic concern over the “Watergate affair”.</i><br><br><i>Following the election, Nixon and his aides would significantly escalate their efforts to sabotage the Democratic opposition and their enemies in the press—at times seeming to daring their opposition to stop them. The opposition finally succeeded in doing so in January 1977, when large Democratic super-majorities in both chambers of Congress impeached outgoing president Nixon, his vice president, and most of his aides and cabinet secretaries.</i><br><br>NIXON: I can only hope that, with the election and the Watergate business behind us, we can finally start doing a little persecuting.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: Yeah?<br><br>NIXON: I mean, only insofar as to level the playing field. Really [unintelligible] the bastards like Jack Kennedy and Johnson did to us with the FCC and IRS.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: We’d need to tread carefully, of course. The Watergate affair—.<br><br>NIXON: Of course, but also, I mean, look at where the opposition is at. They’re completely supine after the shock of November.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: Kennedy was their golden boy. <br><br>NIXON: He was. They put all their hope in him and now they’re out of ideas. We have to make sure they stay down.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: Udall?<br><br>NIXON: Yes, I think we really ought to bring the fight to our adversaries in Congress. Obviously steer clear of any break-ins or of the other spy bullshit that what’s-his-name—.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: Liddy.<br><br>NIXON: Sure. Whatever. Steer clear of that idiotic bullshit that bastard was pushing and toward things that won’t set people’s hair on fire. Scrutinizing their bank records. Tracking their movements. Nothing that leaves a physical record we don’t control. Nothing that we can’t justify with “national security”.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: Church is starting to make noise about that.<br><br>NIXON: Let him. We can use our contacts in the press to discredit his whole program as being hostile to American interests. It wasn’t long ago that he tried to bind our hands in Vietnam.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: I’ll coordinate with Haldeman and provide some options. <br><br>NIXON: The natural inclination of the American people, one proved by this last election, is to believe that the president can do no wrong. We don’t need Cubans organizing break-ins. We don’t need to firebomb buildings or poison fellows. We can use the tools already provided by the Bureau and the Agency and our friends in the press to keep things managed. We can use them as… bumpers. So long as we color within the lines, conform to the standards set by prior Administrations—.<br><br>EHRLICHMAN: I understand what you’re saying.<br><br>NIXON Good. Good. Now, let’s make sure to give lip-service to the idea of transparency with at the Inauguration, sunlight as disinfectant, et cetera.

That’s something.<br><br> NOFZIGER: The best guess I can make is that with all the shit the Democrats are going through now, with whether Wallace has a place in the party or not, voters in those northern liberal states have decided to give the Republicans another look.<br><br> NIXON: That’s real good, Lyn. This could be it for us.<br><br> NOFZIGER: Well, it’s inconclusive. Our data also shows these voters considering voting Republican are concerned about all the investigations going on in Congress now, so they’re not solid, basically. They would be reassured if you focused on some liberal priorities. Sticking with the price controls, maybe throwing them a bone by tamping down the outrage on the right over Roe, things like that. But if you do those things, we could be on the cusp of a realignment. I mean on abortion, surely you think there should be a few exceptions, right? We could focus on that.<br><br> NIXON: Oh yes. Absolutely. We can tailor our abortion messaging, I understand that. I know there are times when they’re necessary. Hell, I would if it were one of my own daughters, and God forbid, if they came home with, you know, one of the others, and uh, if there was some, let’s call it, interracial….some mating going on. You know what I mean. But I wouldn’t hesitate. If that child was…no, no I wouldn’t wait a one goddamn second. That would have to go. So yes, there are times.<br><br> NOFZIGER: Yeah.

Initially pushing it out of his head, it wasn’t until Summer ‘74 when Haldeman acted, hiring a construction firm to create an exact replica of Nixon’s former workplace, inside his own home. Once it was complete, the former president rarely left, falling asleep at his desk or on couches inside the faux Oval Office. He insisted on referring to his former advisors by their titles, and wanted to be briefed as if he were still president. </i><br><br> <i>The office was an exact duplicate of the one Richard Nixon had inhabited for four years, right down to the voice-activated taping system, which remained online.

New York Review of Books? <br><br> HALDEMAN: That can’t be right.<br><br> NIXON: Well it was a damn fine piece, wherever the hell it was. It’s a real hell of a thing, analyzing coups in ancient Greece, what it takes for emperors to abdicate the throne, and how it happens violently. <br><br> HALDEMAN: Right.<br><br> NIXON: Of course, the subtext is damn obvious. Except she isn’t…she isn’t even the president, really.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Uh-huh.<br><br> NIXON: We looked in all the goddamn ballots, it was right there, there’s no way, it’s just…it’s unbelievable how many Americans would vote for someone so unqualified, so, Christ it’s a goddamn disgrace. We’re not even a country anymore.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Sir, did you see the write-up in TIME of the Tongsun Park allegations?<br><br> NIXON: Hm? No, no, what’d it say?<br><br> HALDEMAN: Well it talks about some of these Democrats, usually West Coast ones, who were receiving all these illegal campaign contributions from this man, Park. As it turns out, Park was a Korean intelligence officer.<br><br> NIXON: Christ.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Would’ve been nice if this had come out before the elections in November, but it’ll make life hard for the Democrats-<br><br> NIXON: That’s incredible, Good God. Taking money from the Koreans…wait, Goddammit, is this related to the sons-of-bitches at that church?<br><br> HALDEMAN: No sir. No ties to the Unification Church, not officially.<br><br> NIXON: Fucking Moonies.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Although, with the anger over this scandal, it’s possible your, er, contributions from Reverend Moon could resurface.<br><br> NIXON: Shit-ass reverend. <br><br> HALDEMAN: In fact, this ah, this fellow at The Post called me up the other day. Said he’s working on a series about how the Church scammed the elderly by promising miracle cures and all that. Some of these families paid them tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br> NIXON: Christ, who gives a damn, what does that have to do with me?<br><br> HALDEMAN: What I’m getting at, sir, is that with the public anger over this Korean intelligence thing, and a piece coming soon about the Unification Church taking advantage of the sick and needy, I just think it may be a little risky for you to go through with that speech tomorrow. I mean you’re the public face of the Church, sir, and in a time like thi—<br><br> NIXON: Mr. President.<br><br> HALDEMAN: I’m sorry?<br><br> NIXON: You said sir. I’m the president. Address me only as Mr. President.<br><br> HALDEMAN: Sorry…of course, Mr. President.<br><br> NIXON: And we’re going to do the fucking speech.<br><br> <i>Such are the last words recorded by Richard Nixon on his tapes at the “Winter White House,” before his assassination on January 18, 1975.<br><br> </i>

                <i>In a rare post-presidency interview, recorded in 1986, former President Richard Nixon spoke with Sky US anchor Patrick Buchanan. As a former aide to Nixon, Buchanan gave his subject space to answer the questions which other interviewers would push back on. In this clip, the two were caught on mic after cuts to commercials, discussing a range of topics, including the economy, welfare, and Nixon’s so-called “enemies list.”</i><br><br> BUCHANAN: Alright.<br><br> NIXON: Have you read this new book on ah, Shriver?<br><br> BUCHANAN: Haven’t, no.<br><br> NIXON: Gets into the Kennedys. <br><br> BUCHANAN: You mean the one by, uh, Goodwin? Doris K-<br><br> NIXON: Oh no, no that was the one on Bobby, real piece of trash incidentally. Makes him out to be a goddamn saint.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Right.<br><br> NIXON: No this is on Shriver, kind of a way of covering those years, it’s fascinating, I’m nearly done with it now.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Does it focus on any policy, or is it just, you know?<br><br> NIXON: Gossip? No, no, it’s got a fine section on the, ah, the fiscal crisis. ‘73, ‘75, all the meat shortages.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Right, Christ.<br><br> NIXON: We knew the sons-of-bitches were in a damn mess at the time, but Good God, we had no idea.<br><br> BUCHANAN: And the fucking welfare bill they pushed-<br><br> NIXON: Oh God, you have no idea. It’s a hell of a lot worse than that, what that asshole was pushing, nearly made me puke. <br><br> BUCHANAN: I mean the first thing he did too, it’s an insult.<br><br> NIXON: No, no, the first thing that fellow did was pardon all the draft-dodging bums, remember? And Shriver was there applauding him, though apparently privately he said it was a damn foolish idea. Which of course it was.<br><br> BUCHANAN: [Laughter]<br><br> NIXON: Well they learned their lesson, lost nearly every damn state in ‘76 with that inflation business.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Yeah…only emboldened those people though, digging in to all your dirty laundry, God it’s shameful.<br><br> NIXON: [Inaudible]<br><br> BUCHANAN: The fucking ‘enemies list’ business, what a shitty joke.<br><br> NIXON: Goddamn right.<br><br> BUCHANAN: I mean those purges we made at IRS, they weren’t because those people had offended you personally-<br><br> NIXON: No, no, course not.<br><br> BUCHANAN: It was because they were, well-<br><br> NIXON: Yeah.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Yeah.<br><br> NIXON: All that whining over the bastards in the press too, the ones on television. Crying over that prick Schorr, goddamn clown.<br><br> BUCHANAN: It was the celebrities that really set off all the McGovernites though, once they found out all their top supporters were on that thing, all those investigations after you left.<br><br> NIXON: Newman deserved it though.<br><br> BUCHANAN: You bet. From all that support for King in ‘63, then McCarthy in ‘68, to McGovern in the White House-<br><br> NIXON: Oh no, it wasn’t because of that. I thought he was a homosexual.<br><br> BUCHANAN: What?<br><br> UNIDENTIFIED: 10 seconds!<br><br> NIXON: He had this-<br><br> UNIDENTIFIED: -7!<br><br> NIXON: Well-<br><br> UNIDENTIFIED: -5!<br><br> NIXON: I’ll tell you later.<br><br> BUCHANAN: Alright.<br><br> UNIDENTIFIED: -2!<br><br> BUCHANAN: And we’re back, with former President Richard Nixon, here to bring some civility to our poisoned discourse, and respect even those we disagree with.<br><br>

                <i>After leaving office in January 1973, former President Richard Nixon and his family relocated to San Clemente, California. As the only living ex-president, Nixon was approached frequently by diplomats, politicians, and businessmen for advice and counsel on international affairs. Quickly, he installed a taping system nearly identical to the one in the Oval Office, to preserve his conversations for history. </i><br><br> <i>This tape was recorded on November 28, 1973, after President Henry Jackson had just signed the Emergency Petroleum Reallocation Act, authorizing new drilling in Alaska to combat the global oil shortage in the wake of OPEC’s embargo. President Nixon confers with his friend John Ehrlichman in this tape, discussing Jackson’s political future, Middle East policy, and the energy crisis.</i><br><br> NIXON: What’s the cocksucker saying now?<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: Well, I was hearing from a White House official earlier that the oil in Alaska may not be enough.<br><br> NIXON: Christ.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: So to break the embargo, they’re trying to wean the Saudis and Iranians away from the others. Dangling new weapons systems in front of their faces, in exchange for the Arabs using all the petrodollars they’re floating on to buy U.S. securities—.<br><br> NIXON: Good God.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: —which then are passed on to the IMF, which would give out loans to these smaller countries in South America and Africa and wherever, keeping the whole thing running. <br><br> NIXON: Those sons-of-bitches.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: I know, that’s what I told them, that the idea was complete bullsh-<br><br> NIXON: That’s my goddamn policy!<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: Oh. Right.<br><br> NIXON: The Saudis and the Iranians, Christ, those ungrateful bastards. After everything we did for them. The twin pillars, you remember that?<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: Yes, sir.<br><br> NIXON: Means nothing anymore to these people. God it makes me sick. Did you see that special last night on <i>CBS</i>?<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: With Cronkite?<br><br> NIXON: No no no, with Rather.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: Right.<br><br> NIXON: Said Jackson was the most “pro-Israel president in American history.” Showed his goddamn envoy, that dumb snot-nosed little kid, meeting with Golda Meir. She was telling him some story, I couldn’t stomach it.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: [Laughter]<br><br> NIXON: No, no, I’m being serious. It really made me sick. That speech the bastard gave in the Oval Office last week, Jackson, grandstanding about sending Israel everything they need. What a sick goddamn joke. We did this. Not him. He doesn’t deserve a damn thing.<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: Well the good news is, the numbers for next year aren’t looking any good for him.<br><br> NIXON: Is that right? <br><br> EHRLICHMAN: He’s really in a crunch with this oil thing, then the meat shortages earlier this year, all the Democrats in his own party shouting about him. Saying he’s spending too much on these new missiles when we should be using those funds at home.<br><br> NIXON: Those stupid sons-of-bitches. [Laughter]<br><br> EHRLICHMAN: However, scrapping SALT is one of the few popular things he’s done. It puts the Republicans in a real bind, because they want to denounce him, defend your diplomacy and all that, but their own constituents support Jackson here. So they’re thinking for the elections next year, they’ll just stay quiet on that front.<br><br> NIXON: Fuck ‘em.<br><br>

                <i>We at the John Connally Presidential Center are committed to providing a complete and accurate accounting of President Connally’s decades-long contributions to US decisionmaking. Thanks to the generous support of United Brands Company and the Perot Family Fund, our librarians have been able to begin work digitizing papers, recordings, and other documents produced by President Connally and his associates from 1973–1981, Connally’s so-called “Wilderness Years”. </i><br><br> <i>The below recording is an excerpt of a larger conversation between John Connally and Former President Nixon in October 1975. Against the backdrop of a stock market crash, the bankruptcy of several major cities, popular outrage toward Lindsay’s handling of a crisis in the Middle East, many were pushing for Connally to challenge Lindsay for the 1976 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Connally passed on the opportunity—viewing the proposal as a “poisoned chalice for whichever sucker was stupid enough to sip from it”. His landslide victory in 1980 on the Republican ticket helped set the stage for an uninterrupted eight years of prosperity and a rekindling of America’s national competitiveness.</i><br><br> CONNALLY: As I was saying, Lindsay is completely unreliable as a partner in government.<br><br> NIXON: I think that’s been borne out by events.<br><br> CONNALLY: We warned people about this but, he’s—. He’s a dilettante. An absolute—.<br><br> NIXON: No, I know. Tried to make himself look big by playing hard ball with New York during the bail-out fiasco, but look where that got him.<br><br> CONNALLY: It left the consumer confidence in a chaotic state and convinced the American people he was not aware of economic problems—except in a piecemeal way. Certainly, he presented a confident face, but when you analyzed the problems as many of the professionals had—.<br><br> NIXON: They were jittery.<br><br> CONNALLY: Sure.<br><br> NIXON: The professionals were all so jittery.<br><br> CONNALLY: Certainly, the general thrust was in alignment with what business had been proposing, but, again, the problem is that it looked piecemeal to everyone else. There was no connection between the New York issue and his approach to the recession. His resistance to the cuts. It very much gave the appearance of a man jumping from fire to fire with no plan and that’s what worried people like—.<br><br> NIXON: Yeah.<br><br> CONNALLY: Like it’s what contributed to the crash. People started speculating. Everyone jumped the gun. They didn’t trust him, especially when you have a bunch of congressmen who want to show how smart they are.<br><br> NIXON: [laughter] Well, I have sympathy for him there.<br><br> CONNALLY: No, that’s the one issue that I don’t blame him for. Imagine having Kennedy up your ass every day.<br><br> NIXON: Speaking of Kennedy, what do you make of the primary rumors?<br><br> CONNALLY: Oh, I think there’s no doubt in them. There wouldn’t be these leaks if Kennedy didn’t want them circulating. He’s very much setting the foundation.<br><br> NIXON: You know, the party would be lucky to have you as a nominee. The Democrats never appreciated you.<br><br> CONNALLY: Thank you, Mr. President. <br><br> NIXON: I hope you wouldn’t forget about me if you ever ran…<br><br> CONNALLY: Mm-hm. <br><br> NIXON: I could open doors.<br><br> CONNALLY: Well—. Uh. I think we can discuss that down the line. Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.<br><br>

Christ, it wasn’t, well, no no, it’s sort of a funny thing, ah—<br><br> VGE: I understand it is a direct question—<br><br> NIXON: No no no, it’s good to be frank, you always want to be honest when you knife somebody. [Laughter]<br><br> VGE: [INAUDIBLE]<br><br> NIXON: I understand a lot of the Europeans have been asking that, wanting to know if I’ll run. I won’t forget what a shitshow that thing with the Lira was, you understand? The whole Bretton-Woods fiasco.<br><br> VGE: We expressed regret for how it was handled by our foreign ministry—<br><br> NIXON: I wouldn’t say no to another chance to tell those cocksuckers off. Christ, I would take that opportunity in a heartbeat, especially Wilson, pink right down to his underwear, even him.<br><br> VGE: So you are planning on running then? In the next elections?<br><br> NIXON: I wouldn’t say no, wouldn’t say no. If they, or actually, if a movement of likeminded people demand Dick Nixon give it another go. If some, ah, some patriotic young citizens establish, perhaps, a committee. A Committee on Drafting Richard Nixon for Another Term, or something like that, maybe then, I heh, I would have a hard time saying no.<br><br> VGE: So you plan to establish that committee and then run against Muskie yourself?<br><br> NIXON: Jesus where’d you get that idea?<br><br>

                <i>On August 8, 1975, the novelist Mary McCarthy interviewed Richard Nixon as part of research for a collection of essays she was drafting on the state of American politics. It, along with all other interviews with the former president, is made by the National Archives and Records Administration and the Center for the Study of the Nixon Presidency. For perspectives and commentary from historians, please visit the web page <u>here.</u></i><br><br> MCCARTHY: Good afternoon, Mr. Nixon.<br><br> NIXON: You know, most people here still call me “President”. <br><br> MCCARTHY: I rather doubt I will lower myself to that.<br><br> NIXON: Hm. <br><br> MCCARTHY: I instead wanted to focus on business. As I mentioned in my letter, I am working on an expansion of my Watergate profile series that originally appeared in the Observer—.<br><br> NIXON: Terrible paper. <br><br> MCCARTHY: —and understand that you have been keeping a close eye on the political developments that have occurred since your—.<br><br> NIXON: This tone of yours. It’s… May I just say—it’s incredibly disrespectful. Outrageous. You come in here and <i>impose</i> yourself. It’s scandalous. Offensive. You speak to me like, like common—.<br><br> MCCARTHY: Such is the tone I tend to adopt for those who find themselves in a federal penitentiary, with a lower public approval than a would-be presidential assassin, struggling to find a single publisher willing to distribute his “Prison Papers”. <br><br> I suspect this may be your sole opportunity to define the narrative around your presidency. [Pause.] May I continue?<br><br> NIXON: If you must.<br><br> MCCARTHY: As I said, I had hoped to further color my initial reporting with some close, personal reflections on your current state and your observations on politics since your loss in 1972. It is my expectation that you have no shortage of thoughts on what’s been happening in the world.<br><br> NIXON: You mean the Kennedy shooting?<br><br> MCCARTHY: Among other things.<br><br> NIXON: Jack, then Bobby, then Ted—. Not Ted. What did he call himself? EMK. I suppose the first two got off lucky. I don’t have access to the television in here but I understand from the papers that he can move, what, his right eyelid?<br><br> MCCARTHY: A few toes as well.<br><br> NIXON: What a dumb bastard. A drunk too. It all would have come out, you know, had he not gotten shot by that Byck fellow. That’s how he killed that girl. Now he’s going to be canonized. Just like Jack. But he doesn’t deserve it. Jack did but he didn’t. He didn’t deserve the presidency either. <br><br> MCCARTHY: You resent President Kennedy getting shot and paralyzed?<br><br> NIXON: I don’t resent anything. All I am saying is that if it had been me, they’d have sung a different tune. My brother—God bless his soul—wasted away. It hurt my poor mother, but we didn’t… wallow in self-pity. We didn’t have people writing… sentimental little… you know. <br><br> (Laughter.) But I suppose the joke is on him in the end. Those Kennedy’s… they’ll use him as a prop, a cheap toy. They’ll wheel him on stage at every convention until he croaks, you know. <br><br> MCCARTHY: And your attitude on President Unruh, I would hazard a guess, is similarly negative?<br><br> NIXON: Unqualified for the Office. The whole… The constitutional convention business. It sickens me. There was continuity before, a path we could trace back 200 years. Not as much as the British with their Magna Carta, their Acts of Parliament, but a… a… thread. Now Unruh is the head of a runaway train, talking about throwing the baby out with the bath water. Tearing apart the Senate. Diminishing the presidency. These so-called “limitations” on the FBI, our police. It goes against our history and culture. He talks about “a great crisis of confidence”, and “relighting the torch”, but it’s opening Pandora’s Box for the next fellow.<br><br> Oh, they’ll celebrate it now. I’ve followed the debates, the polls… The momentum is with him, but, mark my words, there will be a counterreaction. Maybe not tomorrow, or or next year… But Americans crave a strong leader. Someone who can, uh, get the trains moving. <br><br> Unruh lacks that. It defines his foreign policy too. The apologies. The… The trip to Cambodia, to Moscow. The world thinks we’re soft. Are soft. If they hadn’t stolen the Office, you’d see something different. We’d be breaking apart Russia and China. Henry had, had this whole approach… <br><br> MCCARTHY: Like a fascist bully boy breaking up a social democratic picnic.<br><br> NIXON: Don’t get me started on the socialists. You know, I was the man who put away Hiss. Now the bastards are running about in our streets. Soon they’ll be in Congress—what’s left of it. The whole thing—.<br><br> MCCARTHY: I wonder if I might ask you about your recent divorce and the allegations of abuse from P—.<br><br> NIXON: This interview is over. <br><br>

                <i>The McCain Center for Peace and Democracy is dedicated to helping Americans better understand their history and the role that its statesmen play in supporting a just, inclusive, and democratic society. As part of our current “Presidency in Crisis” series, we present records from three separate presidential succession crises to give the public an understanding of the conversations happening “behind the scenes” of major decisions. It shows how our leaders can work across the aisle to resolve major disputes.</i><br><br> <i>This recording provides a conversation between Secretary of State Ed Muskie and former President Richard Nixon in June 1976 after public disclosure of President Humphrey’s cancer diagnosis. While many “bed-wetters” in the press encouraged Humphrey to resign the presidency or abandon his re-election campaign, strong sympathy from Democratic and Republican leaders encouraged Humphrey to remain in the race to “finish the job”. His narrow victory over Ronald Reagan validated that approach.</i><br><br> <i>President Humphrey would pass away in March 1977, passing the torch to his vice president.</i><br><br> HUTCHINSON: Hello, Mr. President, putting you through to the Secretary now.<br><br> MUSKIE: Hello?<br><br> NIXON: Ed. I uhh… am sure you’re getting overwhelmed with calls right now, but I wanted to be among the first to—.<br><br> MUSKIE: No. No. It’s alright. <br><br> NIXON: [unintelligible] know we never quite saw eye to eye, but there are certain matters that, I think, bring people together.<br><br> MUSKIE: Yes. Yes. We’re all in shock here as well.<br><br> NIXON: I mean, cancer. God. I think it’s been clear for a while that Hubert wasn’t well, but his speech just now just floored me. Absolutely floored me.<br><br> MUSKIE: Hm.<br><br> NIXON: I assume he let you in on it after the, uh, things you two have been through. I always thought you did an admirable job in ‘68 and was, uh, really quite disappointed he didn’t put you on the ticket in ‘72. I wouldn’t have minded losing if that had been the ticket. The country would have been in good hands.<br><br> MUSKIE: Mm-hm.<br><br> NIXON: Well. Uh. I suppose you’ve been thinking about the elephant in the room. Wallace.<br><br> MUSKIE: I’m not really at liberty to discuss that, Dick.<br><br> NIXON: Of course. Of course. I wouldn’t want to uhh… get you in trouble. But I still keep my finger on the pulse and I know that there are many, many fellows concerned about what it means to put a man like George Wallace into the Oval. Should the worst happen, of course.<br><br> MUSKIE: Mm-hm.<br><br> NIXON: Look, Wallace plays a good part. I know we pretend that the man reinvented himself, but I remember what he campaigned on in ‘68 and ‘64 before he dropped out. Hubert’s done a good job keeping a leash on the man—I’d tell him as much if he’d take my calls—but he’s just a heartbeat away from the presidency. A heartbeat. With things going the way they are in Iran. With the deep hole that the economy is in. I worry what he’ll do. <br><br> MUSKIE: Well, I’ll be sure to relay—.<br><br> NIXON: I just want to let you know that I’m here—.<br><br> MUSKIE: Of course—.<br><br> NIXON: —Should you need advice or support.<br><br> MUSKIE: I see.<br><br> NIXON: Just think of me as being on the bench for you and Hubert. On the bench, always ready to—.<br><br> MUSKIE: I’ll relay your offer to the President. Is there anything else, Dick?<br><br> NIXON: No, no. Just that you and the president are in Pat’s and I’s prayers. I’ll let you get back to—.<br><br> MUSKIE: Yes. I’m afraid I have to go. Goodbye, Dick.<br><br> NIXON: Goodbye, Mr. Secretary of State.

                <i>John Connally’s ascent to the presidency was expected in some ways and unexpected in many others. The former Texas governor had long enjoyed a status as a political maverick, an accomplished statesman, and survivor of political violence. Still, ascending to the presidency in the aftermath of the failed Nixon Administration—amid broad popular discontent, with a hostile Congress, presented severe challenges. In place of the honeymoon period that many of his predecessors enjoyed, Connally entered office more disliked than liked, with Gallup finding only 39% of Americans approving of his leadership.</i><br><br><i>Matters worsened for the Connally Administration in 1974 after the New York Times and Washington Post published a series of stories alleging that the President had a long history of corrupt conduct. Encouraged by significant gains in the House and Senate in that year’s midterms, House liberals successfully impeached Connally.</i><br><br><i>As matters spiralled out of the president’s control, he turned to former president Richard Nixon for guidance. Ironically, after press reports revealed Connally was confiding in Nixon, the FBI would search and uncover extensive records of their conversations. The discussion below, and many others, would later be used by Senate Democrats during their prosecution of the president. They highlight the important role of the press—whose work we honor here at the First Amendment Museum, funded by the Freedom Forum.</i><br><br>NIXON: You can’t pull on any of these bastards?

With Edward M. Kennedy’s confidence shattered, his presidential campaign floundered in the wake of Rockefeller’s immediate popularity, giving Republicans another term in the White House.</i><br><br><i>Given that Kennedy was widely seen as the Democrats’ best chance to retake the presidency, the party was wracked with doubt about their ability to win elections, let alone their competence to govern. With the 1974 midterms approaching, many liberals sought to exploit emerging cracks in the Republican coalition, appealing to populist instincts instead of their usual constituencies. Rockefeller was always somewhat out of place in the party culturally, with his elite ivy tower status seen as an anchor around his neck in times where working Americans had to tighten their belts. In 1973, the president committed an infamous gaffe, in which he misheard a reporters’ question on “<b>a pause</b> in higher interest rates” as a question about Applause, the Tony Award winning Broadway musical starring Lauren Bacall.</i><br><br><i>The transcript below captures Rockefeller’s reaction at the press conference to his mistake, along with other questions on the important issues of the day:</i><br><br>Q: Mr. President, any comment on the latest moves from the Chilean military junta’s defense of the coup?

Have any…any of you seen Applause…ah, no? Well, my dear, it’s…well, the show can speak for itself, but Ms. Bacall, my goodness, a revelation, truly.

He’s got good relations with those Saudis and the other Arab states. He was an oilman you know?

It’s that his, ah, his kid is.<br><br>NIXON: What?<br><br>COLSON: Yeah. His son is the one doing all that shuttle diplomacy.<br><br>NIXON: What the hell? Well, wait, then where’s George when he says he’s going to the Middle East?<br><br>COLSON: Well he does go, sir, he’s in the papers photographed in Riyadh and all that-<br><br>NIXON: Right.<br><br>COLSON: -but uh, he, well, we’ve been tailing him, and he’s been taking this woman with him. Not his wife, this woman, Fitzgerald, something, let me see my notes here-<br><br>NIXON: Oh my God. Oh my God.<br><br>COLSON: Jennifer Fitzgerald, yeah that’s it. She’s an aide at Treasury, her official role is unclear, but yes, when they go on these trips, Bush, Bush Sr. I mean, he stays in his hotel the whole time with this woman.<br><br>NIXON: Jesus Christ. Is this a goddamn joke? Oh my God.<br><br>COLSON: No, sir.<br><br>NIXON: Ok. Christ. Okay. So then, hold on, then his son is the one talking with the Saudis? About the oil embargo?<br><br>COLSON: Yes, sir. He’s a student at Harvard Business School-<br><br>NIXON: This can’t be fucking real.<br><br>COLSON: -working on setting up this oil company, they don’t have a name yet, but with one of his Air National Guard buddies. Guy named James Bath. Interesting character actually, this Bath figure is a representative for a big Saudi construction firm, he’s been getting funds from them. Name’s something like-<br><br>NIXON: So the Saudis trust this kid?<br><br>COLSON: Oh, yes sir. Entirely. They think they’re getting a deal of a lifetime here. They nod along to whatever State tells them and then cut side deals with the Bush kid. It seems almost certainly illegal-<br><br>NIXON: I don’t give a damn about that. The point is that it’s Goddamn embarrassing. This snot-nosed son-of-a-bitch, makes me sick. What can we do about it?<br><br>COLSON: That’s why I came to see you sir. If we yank him out, the Saudis will walk, and the embargo will go on. And we can’t let Bush or his kid know we know.<br><br>NIXON: Right.<br><br>COLSON: But he’s doing all this shuttle diplomacy, spending a lot of time up in the sky, in that plane.

In a tearful speech, the South Dakota Senator confirmed the rumors were true, then proceeded to ask for forgiveness and explain his actions. The American people were evidently swayed, with McGovern winning the White House as a result. </i><br><br><i>Often snidely called the candidate of “amnesty, acid, and abortion,” a slur actually coined by the man sharing his ticket, McGovern always resisted the calls of social liberalism that his base pined for. As a candidate, McGovern had strictly middle-of-the-road positions on abortion and he refused any legalization of drugs. But as president, elevated to the highest office in the land by a base evidently approving of “knocking up their high school sweethearts,” as one cultural critic put it, McGovern changed.</i><br><br><i>The excerpt below captures former President Richard Nixon’s reactions to White House pronouncements in October 1974, just ahead of the midterm elections. On the other end of the line is H.R. Haldeman, one of Nixon’s most trusted aides, who would continue to brief him on political developments after Nixon’s loss.</i><br><br>NIXON: So what do the polls show for that one? <br><br>HALDEMAN: Well, it’s too early to tell for now, but codifying Roe, it’s an enormous step.<br><br>NIXON: Christ.<br><br>HALDEMAN: He probably doesn’t have the votes for it, what with all those southern Democrats, but if these midterms shake out in his favor…<br><br>NIXON: You really think the bastard would be able to pull it off?<br><br>HALDEMAN: Mr. President, it is a strong possibility everyone in Washington is having to consider right now.<br><br>NIXON: Figured it was just a cynical midterms ploy, riling up the bums and the hippies, you know?<br><br>HALDEMAN: That was my gut reaction to, but I’ve heard from my sources in this White House that McGovern is serious about this, just as serious as he was when he dismantled all the infrastructure we built to go over drug users last year.<br><br>NIXON: Goddamn maniac. How are the Democrats shaping up for next month anyway?<br><br>HALDEMAN: On balance, they’ll certainly lose a few seats, but I don’t know sir. McGovern’s foreign policy is a mess, but standing up to the Saudis last year, with the Arab oil embargo, it really endeared him to a lot of Americans outside of his base. He captured that feeling, you know? That America was finally, I don’t know, standing tall?<br><br>NIXON: Good God.<br><br>HALDEMAN: I know, it’s miserable. Same with inflation. It’s as bad as ever but he keeps pushing all these nonsense price controls, some of them literally don’t do anything, but polls are consistently showing people think he’s doing something. In fact, I’ve got it right here, from uhhh Gallup, last month: “47% of Americans blamed banks and big business for rising inflation, while 37% blamed the president’s spending programs, 33% blamed his predecessors—<br><br>NIXON: Stupid sons-of-bitches.<br><br>HALDEMAN: —and 30% blamed Congress.” My point is, all these things we thought would sink him, he’s been able to parry. So I wouldn’t count on a midterms wipeout for Democrats at all.<br><br>NIXON: He’s every bit as bad as we thought. Even worse. Christ, this is unbelievable Bob, are they really going to award this bastard with another two years of blank checks?<br><br>HALDEMAN: Not only that, sir, I’ve been hearing that with the new Congressional majority next year, he’s looking to make amnesty for all draft evaders his top issue.<br><br>NIXON: The Commander-in-Chief pardoning criminals.

Yes, well, uh, there’s actually some debate about that, but no sir, you’re right, it appears he committed suicide in the presidential palace.<br><br>NIXON: And this fellow, er, Augusto, he’s someone we can trust? A real hardass? Tough-as-nails?<br><br>RUMSFELD: He’s certainly all of those things, Mr. President.<br><br>NIXON: Then what’s this bullshit in The Times this morning. The thing about this soccer stadium. Says he’s executing dissidents, that sort of thing, and there’s a couple American kids down there missing. You don’t think…<br><br>RUMSFELD: Anything can happen, sir.<br><br>NIXON: Christ. I know Jackson’s getting flooded with letters over it, since one of those kids was from Washington, but he told them to go to hell. Since the campaign, goddammit, we really beat the hell out of him. And I’m proud of that. But it’s times like this I wish the fellow would stand up and say that part loudly. Because we’re getting so much shit for this in the goddamn press. <br><br>RUMSFELD: It’s regrettable, Jackson’s certainly an important ally on these things.<br><br>NIXON: Exactly, I mean with the bombing and all that, he stood by us, remember? He could’ve attacked, could have been a hell of a thing, but you know what he told me? He told me, Mr. President, you don’t attack the Commander-in-Chief during wartime. It’s bullshit of course, but I thought hey, that’s better than your lowlife peers.<br><br>RUMSFELD: What’s helpful here is that Jackson’s usually the bleeding heart on these issues, talking about human rights and all that, usually in China or with the Soviet Jews, which I know has been a real pain for you, sir—<br><br>NIXON: Don’t get me started, goddamn scum—<br><br>RUMSFELD: —but at least on this issue, sir, on Chile…I haven’t heard a word from him against all these executions. Throwing kids from helicopters, martial law, things like that. You think he’d be all over it, saying it’s fascism again, something. But he’s awful quiet. My, er, my deputy told me, he’s got some friends in the Senator’s office—<br><br>NIXON: Oh, is that right?<br><br>RUMSFELD: Yes, sir. Cheney knows a lot of those kids over there, the think tank ones writing reports on who bombs what and when. Actually a lot of their names were on that report that leaked during the campaign. Clean something…’A Clean Break?’ I think that was it. Anyway it doesn’t matter. Point is, those kids were telling him that privately the Senator’s relieved over it, wishes something similar could happen in Cuba and all that.<br><br>NIXON: Christ so do I. But back to those kids we keep hearing about. You think this fellow Pinochet killed the Americans too? The bums who were living there?<br><br>RUMSFELD: It’s…entirely possible, Mr. President.<br><br>NIXON: That just shows he’s got balls. Executing defenseless college students…Christ, that’s a real man right there. It takes courage to do that, to line up sobbing nineteen year-olds who write for a couple magazines nobody reads against the wall…just like they used to do in Germany. Incidentally, what you told the press the other day was fantastic—<br><br>RUMSFELD: Ah. Thank you sir.<br><br>NIXON: —about that goddamn presidential palace, the looting and so forth. Telling them that, what was it?<br><br>RUMSFELD: That freedom’s untidy.<br><br>NIXON: Right, right, and telling them, Christ, this all just coming from a couple of kids.<br><br>RUMSFELD: Exactly, sir. <br><br>NIXON: They’re calling it, you know, the rape of history and desecration of these historic sites. Bullshit. You know what it is?<br><br>RUMSFELD: Boys being boys.<br><br>

                <i>The Miller Center’s Presidency Project is committed to declassification of White House records which can shed light on significant events in American history. One such event was what one scholar called “the last known act of official anti-Semitism conducted by the United States government.” Beginning in 1971, President Richard Nixon demanded aides provide him a list of officials in the Bureau of Labor Statistics with “Jewish-sounding names.” Thirteen government employees were named, and Nixon fired all of them, fuming to advisors about how jobs reports were being “cooked” by them.</i><br><br><i>These bigoted rants and acts of antisemitism coming from the highest official in U.S. government are a dark note in the history of the presidency, but we at the Miller Center believe it is important to preserve these materials, in order for future generations to learn the unvarnished truth about their country’s leaders. Which is why we have a petition on our website to call for the repeal of S.B. 272, demanding school textbooks be rewritten to excise chapters of American history like slavery, ethnic cleansing of Native Americans, and the Cambodian genocide.</i><br><br><i>The excerpt below comes from a tape recorded on January 15, 1974, during a meeting where Nixon was briefed on developments in the Middle East peace process.</i><br><br>NIXON: You know, Colby was telling me the other day, that as a boy you’re taught to never, lie, cheat, or steal. But when he got to the CIA, Christ, he told me all he ever does is lie, cheat, and steal. <br><br>[LAUGHTER]<br><br>NIXON: Could go for all of government, incidentally. That reminds me, Malek, what have you got on that list I heard about?<br><br>MALEK: Thank you, sir. I know the Labor Department reports on inflation have been, frankly, treasonous.<br><br>NIXON: Damn right.<br><br>MALEK: I also know there are a lot of, er, what you would call enemies in government, who are trying to thwart your movement. The Watergate hoax, the meat boycott panic last year, and now this inflation scam—<br><br>SIMON: Well, hold on, the report from—<br><br>NIXON: No, no, let him finish. Go on, Fred.<br><br>MALEK: And when you first gave me that assignment in 1971, I remember clearly you told me to root out the traitors in government, and I thank you for that mandate sir, but the thirteen [Bureau of Labor Statistics] officials we fired were only scratching the surface.<br><br>NIXON: Absolutely. They’re goddamn everywhere.<br><br>MALEK: So in preparation for this briefing, I’ve computerized an enormous database of every government employee with, as you said, uh, as you told me, anyone with a Jewish-sounding name.<br><br>NIXON: Thank God.<br><br>MALEK: I know this may be a step some will bristle at, rounding up Jews and putting their names on lists and all—<br><br>NIXON: You really put all of their names in that file there?<br><br>MALEK: —but I believe it’s the most effective way to preserve your mandate, as you told me.<br><br>NIXON: That’s incredible. Christ. Look at this, over in the State Department. Good God, there’s thousands of them. <br><br>SIMON: I think we’re, uh, getting a little sidetracked here. I’m not sure how firing every Jew in government is relevant to the briefing I’ve been giving the president on the Arab oil embargo…<br><br>MALEK: You never understood the threat we faced, William. You’re busy shuttling off to—<br><br>SIMON: That’s way out of line, what the hell are—<br><br>MALEK: —God knows where, meanwhile the president is being cornered from all sides—<br><br>SIMON: —you talking about? This is insanity, you sound like a fucking mental patient at a bus station—<br><br>MALEK: —from the enemy within and you want him to back down now? You’re nothing but—<br><br>NIXON: Wait a minute, Henry’s in here?<br><br>MALEK: Oh. Uh, yes, sir. There were bound to be a few high level officials included in the, ah, list. It was computer-generated, so I couldn’t filter out the—<br><br>NIXON: No, no, that’s good. <br><br>MALEK: Oh.<br><br>NIXON: He’s been a real pain in the ass with this embargo, constantly side-stepping Bill and the others, maybe he ought to leave…<br><br>SIMON: Mr. President, with respect, it is the height of insanity to fire your Secretary of State in the middle of an international crisis on the advice of a fucking computer and a junior aide not fit to polish your shoes when—<br><br>MALEK: Do you want the president to fight this threat or not? Answer the question!<br><br>NIXON: Fred, Bill, calm the hell down. Christ, no wonder the Democrats are beating us on this goddamn Watergate nonsense if you’re all at each other’s throats. Even Chisholm is scoring on us now. Focus on the real enemy at hand: mid-level BLS statisticians reporting minor increases in inflation every month.<br><br>MALEK: Of course, I’m sorry sir.<br><br>NIXON: It’s fine, Fred, I know you’re busy on Bush’s staff. Also have you gotten word on if that McCain kid is going to run for the open seat in that, uh, what was it? Arizona district?<br><br>MALEK: Thanks, Mr. President. And no, sir, he hasn’t made a final decision yet, but we believe if he does, he’ll be a terrific ally.<br><br>NIXON: That’s great…Christ, this list is incredible. <br><br>MALEK: It took a lot of time.<br><br>NIXON: If only we had one for the goddamn press, all those pollsters saying our approval is in the teens. What the fuck does that even mean? <br><br>MALEK: I don’t know, sir. But…I suppose I can get right on it.<br><br>NIXON: Can you add other ethnicities while you’re at it? This bastard in Commerce was giving me a hard time the other day, he’s not Jewish, but he’s Italian. See if you can come up with that list too.<br><br>MALEK: Sure.<br><br>

                <i>After Eugene McCarthy’s underdog campaign shocked the world with his victory in 1972, Richard Nixon for many weeks refused to acknowledge his loss, and insisted on continuing the formalities presidents are accustomed to in their time in office. When McCarthy’s team moved into the White House in January ‘73, Nixon fled to South Florida, where he often spoke over the phone with Republican Party leaders, titans of industry, and heads of state. In April of 1973, as McCarthy’s withdrawal plans for Vietnam were rapidly accelerating, a frantic Richard Nixon phoned one of his allies inside the Beltway to ask how this could have happened.</i><br><br>NIXON: Christ, I just don’t understand it. Whenever Henry and I did anything that pissed off those bastards, even the most minute things, they’d blow their tops. A single arms shipment has one goddamn delay and the whole clique at Foreign Affairs loses their damned minds. It’s unbelievable.<br><br>BUCHANAN: No, the press did you no favors sir, I always told people it was TV news that changed public opinion in Vietnam.<br><br>NIXON: Absolutely. Cronkite, that sanctimonious son-of-a-bitch, Good God—<br><br>BUCHANAN: [LAUGHTER]<br><br>NIXON: —when he was weeping, saying the war can’t be won, that we have to throw in the damn towel. It was unbelievable. Of course, Johnson was hanging on every word, he was obsessed with the goddamn polls.<br><br>BUCHANAN: Doesn’t seem like McCarthy is, for the record.<br><br>NIXON: No, no he’s a real ideologue. Ranting, raving, stupid son-of-a-bitch. Him and all those bums who elected the prick.<br><br>BUCHANAN: Their parents are all paying their tuition at those Ivy Leagues anyway.<br><br>NIXON: But that’s what I can’t understand, where the hell are those bastards who were screaming over SALT? Christ, remember Leslie Gelb? First he was against the war, then he was for it, then he was against it again. What’s he doing? Has he got his damned finger up his ass? That bastard McCarthy is handing over all of Indochina to the communists on a goddamn silver platter, but they’re all quiet.<br><br>BUCHANAN: A friend of mine, Congressman, actually told me what’s going on in that regard last week.<br><br>NIXON: Yes?<br><br>BUCHANAN: Well, his theory was that after the, er, fire at the Brookings Institute last summer, those sort of, I don’t know…the foreign policy hands, let’s call them. The ones always pushing for total confrontation, the ones who would run McCarthy’s kooks right out of the White House at any other moment, well now they don’t have a home base. It was just one building, sure, but think how destabilizing that is, these people have gotta get new jobs, they don’t see each other as often, they’re spread out now, scattered. There’s no effective opposition to McCarthy’s withdrawal from inside the Beltway. Same with his new arms control agreements and the defense budget he submitted, the one that would cut spending by a third, they didn’t make a peep…sorry, sir, are you still there?<br><br>NIXON: Fuck.<br><br>

Instead, he was chased from the Oval Office by the nattering nabobs he'd spent years railing on about.

Pundits speculated darkly that the barely-hidden Nazi spirit of the man would reveal itself in a modern Beer Hall Putsch, complete with Nixon-Agnew brownshirts marching on the Capitol, but it never happened. Once the story broke, he rolled over and fled to Baltimore so quickly that White House staffers still check under the couch cushions in case he left any bribe money behind. Today he spends his time raising millions to combat the international Jewish cabal. He was an Unwelcome and Embarrassing presence at the funeral, but there was nothing anyone could do to stop him because, after all, he was a President too. <br><br>Agnew still loves to show up to the dinners and photo opportunities just like the Kennedy's and Nixon's of the world, and he smiles no matter how the Real Presidents tried to stay out of camerashot for fear that even a rumor of association would sink their credibility.

Unlike Nixon, who had to teach himself how to hit below the belt, Connally had been taught all of his tricks by masters of the craft like Lyndon Johnson. He was half as cruel and twice as able as his Californian counterpart and it would be no surprise if the Times revealed that he had hired Oswald to shoot him in the shoulder all along. Together, for a brief moment in time, the President and Vice President were the two happy husbands of one cruel, sociopathic family.<br><br>Of course, all the love letters and candlelit dinners didn't stop Big John from gutting and disposing of Dick the second he realized that he could take Nixon's place. It was a primitive, instinctual thing, the same way bats sleep upside down. Nixon knew it and he never held a grudge.

He spent even more trying to resuscitate his and Nixon’s image in the aftermath of their dismal presidencies.<br><br>Had he lost in 1972, historians might have viewed Rocky favorably, a final, thwarted gasp of moderate Republicanism.
