Hitler's victory in Europe and the nuking of Pearl Harbor seriously damaged American prestige in the world. This especially shocked America's political system which saw the rise of various third parties, culminating in the National Progressive Pact, a big-tent of various political factions. In 1964, two candidates of wildly different political views run against each other. Senator Wallace F. Bennett of Utah, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy of Massachusetts.</p><p><ul><li>Wallace F. Bennett represents the conservative/moderate tent of American voters, and campaigns on a slogan of not rocking the boat too hard.</li><li>Robert F. Kennedy represents the idealistic liberal, Kennedy was angered by Nixon's veto of the civil rights act and as such joined the NPP, winning its nomination for president this year.</ul></li></p><p>Both candidates are broadly popular with the American people, but Kennedy has to make sure not to go overboard with his rhetoric or he could lose a chunk of support! The issues of the day are, the  South African war, Kennedy's Assassination, Nixon's Resignation and Civil Rights.</div>",

Because of this, he rarely excites the average voter unlike Kennedy, which could cause some slippage.
