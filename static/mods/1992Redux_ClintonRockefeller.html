The early returns had you ahead of Bush, but you and your campaign staff still breathe a sigh of relief as you pass 270 with relative ease. They'll say your victory was inevitable, but the race was incredibly volatile, and anything could have happened, so credit to you for pulling through. Democrats are ecstatic that they have finally taken back the White House after twelve long years, and Republicans are scrambling to regroup after losing an election many of them thought to be winnable. And for the first time, baby boomers have taken the White House, ushering in a new era of American politics.<p><p>Now it's time to get down to business and deliver on your promises to overhaul healthcare, reform campaign finance laws, slash the deficit, balance the budget, and more. As long as Congress stays friendly to your agenda, you should have relatively smooth sailing. Best of luck!</p>"
