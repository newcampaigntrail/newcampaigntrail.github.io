Not only did you trounce Wallace and Thurmond, but you’ve managed to do so in embarrassing fashion to the point even New York was in contention! And much of that comes down to your own efforts to make amends with men like Dewey. The two of you for the past four years tearing each other apart, only to come together at the last minute for this overwhelming victory. They say irony's a bitch, and right now there's no better proof to that.</p><p>It takes a monumental amount of effort not to laugh at the fact you're having lunch with the man who once threatened to punch your lights out, yet as you sip on a bottle of expensive wine you manage to keep a calm demeanor. Of course that won’t stop you from relaying this entire scene at the dinner table the next night, after all if you can’t have a good laugh in your own home then when can you?</p>"];

In a shocking event, you've won every single state and successfully gained massive conservative supermajorities in congress! With this you can easily bring America back to the prosperity of the roaring 20s before all this 'New Deal' nonsense and what other insanity both Roosevelt and Wallace have implemented during their time in office. Clearly the country knew it was time to reverse course from government intervention and back to the beauty of private enterprise! No doubt the next four years are going to see a massive change in not only the United States, but the world as well once you're finished enacting your grand vision. To the victor goes the spoils, and you certainly earned quite a lot.</p>"];
