The entire country has been left confused and bewildered - the rumors of a comeback may have been believed by some, but no one ever thought you would win in a bona fide landslide against an incumbent that had just won a war. Perhaps the economy was too bad, or you had really learned and grown from 1972, like you said early in the year.</p><p>With this margin of victory, your brand and vision of liberalism has been completely vindicated, leaving the moderation of those like Dukakis squarely in the dust, and paving the way for a new coalition for the Democratic Party. Likewise, your running mate, Tom Harkin, is gearing up for his own run, either in four or eight years - becoming a two-term president may be possible in your case - and you give him your blessing.</p><p>Nonetheless, this momentous victory is celebrated by your entire campaign, your family, and liberals across the nation. America came home - it's a shame it only took 20 years.</p>",

You've lost in a landslide - again, dredging up memories of your campaign 20 years ago. You watched Bush, upon being notified of his win, walk up in front of cheering voters, who no doubt feel vindicated of the Republican Party's triumph over the old liberal majority. And there you sat, after your call with him, defeated. But you don't take it too hard - you never wanted this anyways.</p><p>It looked for a second that you would have broken the consensus on you built by your loss in 1972, but the label of one of the biggest losers in American politics is going to stick - and it's going to be worse than Mondale's. Whatever you did, it just didn't seem to work - Bush might have been too powerful and his re-election a foregone conclusion, like many thought in the wake of the Gulf War.</p><p>Your political career is hereby over - its grave was dug in 1980, and you are finally happy to let it go. But you will not stop fighting for what you believe in as you return to lecturing - maybe the next Democratic president will give you an appointment?</p><p>Good luck, Mr. McGovern.</p>",

Everyone across the nation is surprised - this wasn't what was predicted back when President Bush was seen as invulnerable in 1991. But somehow, due to sheer tenacity and a variety of other factors undermining Bush, you've pulled it off, after 20 years of humiliation at the hands of the Republican Party.</p><p>Tom Harkin is equally bewildered, but he is nonetheless happy - he plans on running as your successor, and you're glad to have him as one. Bush and Quayle are despondent, and in his call to you, the president is amiable, but his voice betrays his true feelings of defeat.</p><p>Such a political fall and rise - from the crushing defeat of 1972 to the stunning victory of 1992 - will surely be of interest to presidential historians in the future. Already, pundits and pollsters are trying to scratch out whatever data they can about your coalition's demographics in order to explain this victory.</p>",

You don't feel bad about the loss - it was an improvement from '72, and you feel like you didn't have a chance anyways.</p><p>As you call up President Bush, you have a good talk with him, going from the election itself to minor topics like the weather or sports games. You can't help but feel completely serene and calm, and Bush notices. As you hang up, you turn to your supporters - your family, your friends, and your staff - and thank them for all they've done with a smile. Many have stuck with you for so long, but it's time to let a new generation take the reins.</p><p>You hear rumors in the coming months of other, younger Democrats gearing up to run - Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Al Gore of Tennessee, even Mario Cuomo, whom you wanted to support this year if he agreed to run. It seems like the halcyon days of your staunch liberalism are over. Perhaps you'll be appointed to some position by these rising stars if they ever become president.</p><p>For now, though, you should enjoy your retirement. You gave it a damn good try, George.</p>",
