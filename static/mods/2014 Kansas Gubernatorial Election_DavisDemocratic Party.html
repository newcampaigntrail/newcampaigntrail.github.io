The endorsement makes Umbehr one of the highest-ranking elected officials in the country to back Johnson’s long-shot bid.</p><p>“Americans deserve a choice grounded in principle, honesty, and liberty,” Umbehr said in a statement released by his office. “I believe Gary Johnson represents the best path forward for a country tired of partisan politics and government overreach.”</p><p>Governor Umbehr, whose approval ratings have remained lukewarm midway through his first term, emphasized that his endorsement was not about political calculation but about “standing up for consistent values.”</p><p>“Both major parties have let the American people down,” he continued. “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin — more spending, more control, and more division. Kansans know I’ve fought to make government transparent and accountable, and I see those same values in Governor Johnson.”</p><p>“Taken together, Trump and Clinton’s flaws leave voters searching for integrity and reason,” Umbehr said. “That’s why I’m proud to support Gary Johnson — a man I can admire and trust.”</p><p>Johnson has been polling in the low double digits nationwide, marking the strongest performance for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot’s run in 1996. While still trailing the major-party nominees, his steady numbers and the growing unity within the Libertarian Party suggest that his support could continue to climb as voters look for an alternative to the polarized political mainstream.</p>`)

What it delivered were deficits, underfunded classrooms, and uncertainty for families and businesses alike.”</p><p>The bill rolls back the deep income tax reductions passed in 2012 and 2013, including the full repeal of the exemption on pass-through business income. It also restores higher top marginal rates, a change state analysts say will generate more than $500 million annually once fully implemented.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers, joined by a bloc of moderate Republicans, pushed the legislation through both chambers after months of negotiations. Several GOP legislators cited pressure from school districts and local governments struggling to balance budgets amid declining state aid.</p><p>“This wasn’t a partisan decision — it was a practical one,” said State Sen. Jim Denning (R–Overland Park), one of several Republicans who crossed party lines. “The numbers simply weren’t working.”</p><p>Supporters of the repeal argue the additional revenue will stabilize the state’s finances and allow Kansas to begin restoring cuts to education, infrastructure, and social services. Davis has pledged that education funding will be the first priority in the upcoming budget.</p><p>Republican conservatives sharply criticized the move, warning that higher taxes could slow economic growth and drive businesses out of the state. Former Governor Brownback released a statement calling the repeal “a retreat from pro-growth policy.”</p><p>But recent polling suggests public support has shifted. A majority of Kansans now say the tax cuts hurt the state’s economy, according to a survey released earlier this month by Fort Hays State University.</p><p>“For too long, Kansas has been an experiment,” Davis said as he signed the bill. “Today, we turn the page and start governing based on evidence, not ideology.”</p>`)
