Like the petty, jealous, embittered children they were, no different than the New York real estate tycoons, who spent 50 years belittling you as a non-entity, but you played them for fools, because only you had the vision, the genius to accomplish this feat of feats.

That much is obvious from the stunned faces of those that surround you, even now as the map grows redder and redder and the phone calls stream in from across the country, tears welling in their eyes instinctively applauding in your presence. None of the precious models saw this as a possibility, all the fake polls and the nasty media, well we’re in a position to finally do something about that, they’ll have to listen, after a landslide like that, they’d be fools not to.</p>

The clapping grows louder, as you stand silent in the center screen waiting for the opportune moment. The speech you had, isn’t good enough anymore, crap about ‘putting divisions behind’ and ‘unity’ it’s snoozefest stuff, people need to know that you don’t forget, and you certainly don’t forgive. The press is waiting, bated breath to see what this astounding victory will mean, the country has awoken to a new reality, will we finally see a different Trump? They’ll have to wait a little longer, we’ll get to the speech, but first, let’s riff a little. </p>`)

After 4 years of unorthodox government. The President has handily won a second term, building a strong and expansive coalition, encompassing not just the nation's conservatives and moderate moderates but he was able to make massive strides across the strong racial and economic divides, that have separated Democrats and Republicans for decades, the President has no qualms about making enemies, and has at times governed divisively, but that didn’t stop millions of Americans being converted to his cause, … and …</p>
    <p>I’m sorry, I can’t do this, are you people crazy, after everything he’s done, I know the other guys were a little weak in the knees and maybe they wanted to raise taxes a little but can that really justify this, this monster who wants to completely annihilate our values? This isn’t the country I love, this isn’t America anymore.</p>

Trucks strapped with flags form convoys as they lay on their horns, hooting and hollering late into the night and early into the morning. The decadent elite, crushed. The woke America canceled, the socialist menace conquered, destroyed, laid utterly low by the strength of your will. The cameras struggle to find the opposite picture, the dejected Democrats, because they’re gone. The supporters who held desperately onto the barest strands of hope, have abandoned the arena, discarded their signs, and stripped themselves of their uniforms, like the defeated force of some neutered nation. </p>

Then McCarthy the soon-to-be speaker of the House, so-long as he gets your consent of course. And finally McConnell, except he’s white as a sheet, paralyzed as he looks deep into your eyes, it’s deeply uncomfortable, and you wonder if perhaps we can swap him out for someone else?</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter, dressed to the nines, ready for a victory rally, just as Mike reaches out to shake your hand you completely ignore it and move right toward his wife ‘Mother’ apparently, you’ve heard, she’s a doubter, not a fan—big problem. Leering over her with her children behind her, you point her out to the enraptured crowd and tell everyone “I hear you didn’t think we could win, oh boy, that was wrong, wasn’t it? Why would you say something like that?” Before turning to Mike and saying, “That’s loser talk Mike.”</p>
    <p>And the staff, they applaud, they all applaud you. And you look at Mike, and he applauds you too.</p>
    <p>The family is electrified, each of them quick to ape off your success, the greatest President in history, no ifs, and, or buts. Moving quickly to nurture their own political ambitions, they’ll all fall flat, you’re certain of it, but that will only build you up, as even more of an icon.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania is gone, tuned out of the whole gaudy ceremony, uninterested, probably, you think disheartened. But who cares now. Perhaps a divorce will come, who knows, but think of the headlines, has any President done that?</p>
    <p>Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that all the networks, the whole planet is covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>

    <p>The pundits behind their desks, they're ecstatic, vibrating, leering, drooling over the blown-up map, drowning you out. One by one, they sink the hatchet in deeper and deeper, gouging you. They lay it all out, explaining why Americans had so explicitly and horrifically denounced you and your feckless campaign, Trumpism they say is dead, a footnote, a bump in the road of liberal democracy. The Television flickers from MSNBC, where Joy Anne Reid wipes tears from her eyes in awe at the “Complete wholesale rejection of Trump” to CNN where Anderson Cooper recalls that he’s never experienced an election night quite like this one, “It was all downhill from the start” to Fox, those traitors throwing you under the bridge “Perhaps it was a mistake” says Baier “To ever let this man into national politics”. And then the T.V. clicks off, for the first time in a long while, silence echoes through the White House. </p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>There’s got to be a way back from this, </strong> the illegal voters, yes. Millions and millions of them, stuffing ballot boxes across the country. Voting twice, three times, maybe more. And don’t forget the dead voters, coming out of the woodwork, they’ve done it before, don’t get fooled. And the voting machines, those things are completely rigged, you’ve seen it for yourself, you pull the lever and it switches, its fraud, complete and total fraud.</p>
    <p>But it still doesn’t add up, how could they? Right across the country, right under everyone’s noses. Well, that was obvious, the news, the fake lying press, they covered it up, covered everything up, slandered you. We should sue, sue them, sue the states, sue everybody, we have to stop this. It’s a complete theft … the biggest fraud in history…</p>
    <p>But it’s not just the press, it’s the voters, they’ve been duped, taken for a ride. They wouldn’t just do that to you, after everything you’ve done, they’ll come, if we tell them to, they’ll come. The theft is so blatant. As the eerie stillness pervades the White House, you can hear something, fireworks, not on the T.V. from outside the windows, across the whole city. The chanting, the singing, the dancing. Lighting up night skies of hundreds of cities, as millions join the festivities, while your supposed loyal people are nowhere to be seen, they’ve betrayed you, after all you’ve done for them.</p>
    <p>The phones aren’t ringing, or maybe they are, but no one is answering. Why would they, the parties over, the skeleton staff that stayed through the entire horror show, the ones too dumb to look for another job weeks ago, are now too busy trying to remember this moment, no doubt for some tell-all book they'll write, ‘The End of Donald Trump’ That’s what they’ll call it. An attempt to get through to the RNC is aborted, after it’s leaked that the party is already plotting against you, to purge itself of your element, to deride you as a mere aberration, that the adults are back in charge. The Murdochs, the McConnels, and the McCarthy’s eager to use your final downfall to their benefit.</p>

    <p>Pence too, that soulless husk has completely flipped, another knife in the back, he wants out of your shadow, as if he could compete, eager to set himself up as the party successor, already hinting that it was he who had curbed your worst impulses, his office isn’t answering, if there’s going to be a speech, he won’t be there, he wants nothing to do with you; because you’re a loser. You lost.</p>
    <p>That’s it, isn’t it? The whole thing, a big con job, your whole life, one epic tragedy, to take a man who never accomplished a damn thing without Daddy’s help and lift him up. To the highest of heights, a national spectacle, a global celebrity, the biggest brand there is. Only to destroy him and leave him with nothing, because that’s what you are really, deep down, nothing.</p>
    <p>It's clearer than ever now, you can really see, It’s so obvious, it’s time, to give up. Concede, that will show them, it’s the last thing they expect, they want you to cry and pout on television, to talk about the rigging, and the fraud, and the witch hunts, well. Fuck’em. Let’s concede, thank our wonderful supporters and leave this whole rotten thing behind.</p>
    <p>You’re out, it’s over. Just imagine, ‘ex-president’, there’s a lot of money to be made in that, and I could go anywhere, do anything, totally unconstrained, the kids, let them fight over what’s left, Melania she can stay in Florida, or leave, it doesn’t matter now.</p>
    <p>The quickly drafted speech is placed in front of you, it’s good, short and sweet, they’ll love it. Gracious they’ll call you, very gracious.</p>`)

    <p>The New York Times election needle had fully turned now. You flicker the channels, MSNBC their lips quivering Kornacki looks disheveled, searching the board for a pathway, a way out, but there isn’t one. One by one they each trapped shut. The disdain they hold for you, is dripping, from every orifice, Rachel Maddow is conspicuously absent, apparently, she’s had a complete emotional breakdown. And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>

    </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States. After 4 years of unconventional and occasionally chaotic governance, the President has convinced enough Americans to stick with his populist vision of the United States, over that of Joe Biden, the former Vice President, who to many Democrats represented a past they hoped to return to.</p>
    <p>The elderly Joe Biden came under strong criticism from his Democratic allies, for being unwilling to campaign more vigorously, choosing to adopt a more Covid-conscious campaign, which many campaign associates began to criticize as a poor attempt to hide the former Vice President's weaknesses.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The devastation was palpable,</strong> and boos filled the arena. “This is horrible, I feel like I’ve lost my country today” Many people expressed immense disappointment in the Biden campaign for the second straight loss to Trump. And a pervading theme was that young Democrats placed the blame purely on Biden “The contempt he shows for our generation is disgusting, Democrats like Joe only care about us every four years.”</p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p>The other side of the phone crackled, as it passed in the air from aide to the candidate. His breathing was slow, his voice strained. You could tell that every word was an agony, still contorting to the reality of defeat.</p>
    <p>“Mr. President … it appears that … it seems that…”</p>
    <p>The fight had left his body, perhaps it was dawning on him, that his entire life, was a waste. The promises he vowed to keep, were empty.</p>
    <p>“Just remember Donald, it’s not about …”</p>
    <p>You await yet another bullshit lecture, on decency or respect for the republic, but it doesn’t come, the voice is gone, and another voice appears and ends the conversation.</p>`)

Democratic primary voters and Americans as a whole craved a return to the Obama era, and who could serve as a better representative of that age, than the former Vice President.</p>
    <p>Long in the tooth, and some complained a little past his prime Mr. Biden positioned himself as the obvious choice to lead the Democrats as their chosen leader in the so-called 'Battle save the soul of the nation.’ A battle he seems to have finally won. </p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“BIDEN!” </strong>the supporters chant. “JOE, JOE, JOE BIDEN!” Biden an institutional 70-something square, isn’t usually seen as an inspiration for street parties, but that’s the scene on the street. And at times the Biden team struggled to market their candidate as inspirational but that doesn’t matter “Winners make history, this was a campaign of unity, not division and this is Biden town.”</p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them?

We’re not going to get rolled, we’re going to fight, aren’t we, Yes! We have to fight. We have to. Mike’s face shifts, just a glint but you catch it, he’s spooked.</p>
    <p>These cowardly, weak idiots. Are they blind, it’s obvious they’re stealing it. With the markers, and the blinders. They’re using the election against me. It’s rigged. They want me to concede well fuck them, we'll never concede.</p>

The President was able to win a second term, after getting enough Americans to stick with his deeply conservative vision of the country, over that of his opponent Bernie Sanders, a left-wing stalwart of the Senate and avowed, Socialist, whose nomination represented the victory of his insurgent candidacy over that of many of his more moderate rivals, his nomination greatly irked the establishment of the party, who feared him to be far too radical, for the challenge ahead.</p>
    <p>Bernie Sanders's base of support was strong, tapping into an angry base of the young, but it proved too small and insular to defeat the incumbent President, and his disassociation from the Democratic party frightened many moderates from supporting his ticket, the so-called 'Never Bernie' vote proved strong enough to end what is likely to be his last run for the Presidency.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The horror was crippling,</strong>and eyes teared up across the arena. “I’m devastated, Bernie was for us, he was for all of us, we needed him” It was clear that emotions were high as the crowd reacted to the loss of their beloved candidate. And many expressed their anger expressly at the Democratic party apparatus, which they claim hobbled Bernie. “these slime stories, where did these come from? This was from the Biden guys or the Warren team, the Trump people just picked up the stick from them” and some veered into conspiracy. “They wanted Bernie to lose, they’d rather have Trump President for another 4 years than risk real change”. </p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p>The other side of the phone echoed, you could hear what sounded like CNN in the background, Wolf Blitzer talking about California’s late returns. He was on the phone now, steeling himself, preparing himself to swallow his defeat, a quick lash of pain and it would all be over.</p>
    <p>“Mr. Trump, it seems the electoral college has gone to you ”</p>
    <p>The words shot out of his mouth, like a speeding train, the faster they got out, the sooner the conversation would be over, and then he would go back, but back to what?</p>
    <p>“I don’t get to decide how it works, but there it is, I just ask you keep in mind, all our people, all our people, you can’t forget them... so… uh…goodbye.”</p>
    <p>The phone was toyed with for a second, unsure whether the candidate had terminated the call early, but then the line went dead, and he was gone for good.</p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Bernard Sanders, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 years of ultra-conservative governance, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole turned to Sanders, an insurgent populist and professed Democratic Socialist, now the first President to adopt the once-fringe moniker. </p>
    <p>Long considered an outlier in American politics, the Vermonter earned the trust of his constituents and built an expansive coalition of the young, poor and many non-voters to overcome the once deadly stigma of his political label, he led his campaign as a battle over what he called the ‘entrenched power of corporate lobbyists and billionaires’ of whom he counted President Trump one of. </p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“FEEL THE BERN!” </strong>the supporters chant. “CAN YOU FEEL IT!” The crowds are ecstatic, a dream come true, President Sanders. And across the country, people are trying to swallow this major swing for the United States, “In January we will go from the most far-right President ever to the most far-left, we’ve ever had, it’s quite something” Yes to many, Bernie’s victory doesn’t just mark a change from one administration to another, but has been characterized by some of his most hardcore and determined supporters, the ‘Bernie Bros and Babes” as nothing less than a Second American Revolution. </p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>

We’re not going to get rolled, we’re going to fight, aren’t we, Yes! We have to fight. We have to. Mike’s face shifts, just a glint but you catch it, he’s spooked.</p>
    <p>These cowardly, weak idiots. Are they blind, it’s obvious they’re stealing it. With the markers, and the blinders. They’re using the election against me. It’s rigged. They want me to concede well fuck them, we'll never concede.</p>
    <p>Of these people only a few really get it Rudy, he sees it, it’s obvious, we have to declare victory. If we don’t, it’s over. We have to get out there and tell them, tell them to stop the count, stop the fraud, stop the steal.</p>
    <p>The family try to hide themselves, those feckless disasters. Only Melania stays, watching the television, enraptured, muttering to herself in Slovenian.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>Then the news comes through,</strong></p>

    <p>“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you. What we’ve done tonight is nothing less than spectacular, a truly revolutionary achievement...”</p>
    <p>“This started as a grassroots movement, and grew into something unprecedented, and it’s time to use this to lay the groundwork for a political transformation… ”</p>
    <p>“I’ve heard you all, enough is enough, this will be a government not for the few, but for the many …”</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States. After 4 years of what some have called irregular government. The President was able to win a second term, after convincing enough Americans to cast their ballots for his vision of the country, over that of his opponent Elizabeth Warren a left-wing progressive Senator and consistent opponent of capitalism, her nomination in a packed field of democrats inspired new hope in electing a female President, but many were discomforted by her overtly left-wing stances on many issues of the day.</p>
    <p>Warren tapped into the progressive anger at Donald Trump and became a frequent target of his personal attacks against her, specifically for her disputed claim of Native American ancestry. Her campaign also came under attack for focusing too heavily on minute policy details and missing the big picture that the President was able to tap into more successfully. Warren will likely return to the Senate and continue to oppose the Trump administration and carry on her campaign of pursuing the President for alleged corruption, though it’s unlikely she will head another national campaign..</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten.

On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The disappointment was evident,</strong>four years ago many of these same women were hoping to elect the first woman President, only to be upset, and now it’s happened again.“I can’t, she was so good, a great candidate, I just think this country might never have a woman President”. The tears were flowing in the stadium, as they waited patiently for their to speak. “We’re not a serious country, we wanted to talk about the issues, and how to actually solve them, but the media all they want to talk about is personality and supposed scandals, our country deserves men like Donald Trump” The Warren team proved rather adept at uniting the Democratic party, but it wasn’t enough. There’s not a lot of anger here, some think Warren should have fought harder, to beat the President's smears, but a lot of people here are simply blaming the system.</p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone.

After 4 years of Trump's government of complete chaos, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have elected the first female President in the nation's history, Elizabeth ‘Liz’ Warren, the progressive Senator from Massachusetts and former economics professor who has throughout her time In Washington positioned herself as a force to combat what she has described the ‘entrenched power of money in politics’ and has frequently criticized capitalism as not working for everyone. </p>
    <p>Her journey to the White House began as an advisor to the Obama administration and she quickly cemented herself as a key soldier in the fight for consumer protection. Her Presidential campaign relied heavily on the theme of her wealth of knowledge on policy with the enduring refrain ‘I have a plan for that’ and defeated her primary opponents as an outspoken, yet realistic progressive choice aided by frequent attacks from President Trump</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose?

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“PERSIST!” </strong>the supporters screamed. “AND KEEP PERSISTING!” The crowds were overjoyed, a twinned joy both at electing the first woman President, and placing a progressive wonk in the White House. “Come January, we’ll have someone who’s fighting for us, who deeply understands the system, and actually wants to change it”. Yes, it seems to Warren's biggest supporters the future looks bright indeed, a stark opposite to the government-by-tweet of the Trump administration and onward toward deeply progressive reform. Will she succeed, there are a lot of hurdles in front of her, she’s promised big, but can she deliver big? </p>

And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>

    </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States. After 4 years of messy leadership. The President was able to win his second term, convincing enough Americans to stick with his brand of conservatism, over that of his opponent Pete Buttigieg. The former Mayor of South Bend, he entered the race with very little political experience, and almost no national profile, Pete was at best a politically confused candidate who struggled to define himself on the issues, only emerging as the Democratic nominee, after a bevy of other moderate Democrats failed to find their footing in the race, with his unique appeal as both a veteran, the youngest candidate in the race, and being a gay man.</p>
    <p>However, his inexperience only opened up his campaign to accusations of flip-flopping on key issues, accusations over his credentials and past employment came under intense media scrutiny, and his homosexuality possibly proved a detriment to socially conservative voters. Pete’s loss puts him in a strange place in politics, though young he holds no elected office and there are no obvious avenues for a state-wide position opening up, though perhaps he will find a position, in a future Democratic administration.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The cold wind was blowing,</strong>eyes welled with tears, and partners embraced one another in solum displays of solidarity. “I always knew it could go this way, that America wouldn’t accept him, but it’s painful because it may never happen again, in my lifetime”. Polls consistently showed that even most Democrats were uncertain if their country was ready to elect a gay President, and many in the crowd were annoyed by what they saw as an openly homophobic administration deliberately using that sentiment to drive its campaign. “What we saw here was an expression of hate, cis-men, expressing their inherent in many cases subliminal anti-gay rage” Though a renegade few were willing to go after the Pete campaign “Where were the issues? You can’t beat Donald Trump in a contest of ego, where did we get that idea?” </p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> The phone buzzed to life, on the other side, the room was loud, bustling. Perhaps they were strategizing, hopelessly combing for another path, a way back, but it wasn’t there.</p>
    <p>“Hello Mr. President, it’s Pete.” </p>
    <p>That’s right Pete, just Pete. Not a Mayor, certainly not a President. </p>
    <p>“Well, our guys, have determined that there is no sufficient path forward for our campaign, and so we’re conceding, as it were.” </p>
    <p>That’s right, breathe it in Pete. This is the last night that you’ll mean anything to anyone. How embarrassing for him, to have peaked so young, with nothing but disappointment left ahead.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a good campaign, we’ve raised a lot of issues, and going forward I hope it contributes to our nation's continued success.”</p>
    <p>He desperately tries to squeeze some inkling of a victory out of his utter defeat. The phone is handed over to someone else and shortly after Pete Bu—whatever his name is, vanishes from your memory.</p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Pete Buttigieg, has been elected the 46th President of the United States as well as the youngest and first openly gay man to ever hold the office. After 4 years of Trump and the chaos of the Republican party, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole, has voted for a massive course change, in electing a man who has very little political experience, the only elected office he ever held being the Mayor of South Bend Indiana, but though his resume is light he was able to present himself as a serious candidate who could deliver a Democratic victory at the polls.</p>
    <p>The darkest of dark horses, President-Elect Buttigieg entered the race with almost no name recognition amid a tightly packed Democratic field. However, his story inspired the Democratic party centrists to his cause, as a midwestern, outsider untarnished by the political mudslinging of Washington, and of course beside him the new First Spouse-to-be Chasten Buttigieg his husband of 2 years. His long-shot candidacy was aided by his youth, military record, and the support of LGBTQ+ groups.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“BOOT-EDGE-EDGE !” </strong>the supporters drummed. “BOOT-EDGE-EDGE!” The crowds were vibrant and fluid. Their highest hopes fulfilled, not just electing a Democrat, but electing a gay man President of the United States. “This means so much to us, who thought, because we’re different, we’ve been looked down on, discarded our whole lives, to see him up there, it just shows us and the world that it’s not a sin”. Yes, to many even those who were not thrilled with Pete can’t help but recognize the amazing feat, 10 years ago Gay Marriage was illegal in most of the country and today most Americans have elected an openly gay man, it’s nothing short of miraculous. </p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after 4 years of unconstrained leadership. The President was able to win his second term, persuading enough Americans to stick with his populist-Republican policy, over that of his opponent the former Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg entered the race late into the primary season, vaulting over his opponents thanks to massive amounts of his own seemingly unlimited wealth. However, despite attempted leeways, his candidacy became over-encumbered by criticism from Democrats who saw him as a carpet bagger pointing to his long history of Republican politics, and attacking his controversial decisions as Mayor, blotches on his record that the Mayor couldn’t overcome. </p>
    <p>Despite his supposed unique appeal to independent voters, they proved disinterested in his almost technocratic appeal, though his advertising campaign was large, there is little evidence it got its money's worth and many reported being turned off by his avalanche approach. Though he was lauded for choosing Stacey Abrams as his running mate, he failed to win over a large segment of his parties left, which nearly categorically rejected him. Bloomberg will likely play a role in the periphery of American politics as a mega-donor, and he has further boosted the profile of Mrs. Abrams, it is probable that the mayor's White House dreams are over.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling.

On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The night was cold, an icy corporate atmosphere. </strong>Disappointed faces, shook their heads at television screens, plunged hands deep into pockets, cradling lukewarm beverages. “We knew it could always go this way. Mike, he was a good candidate, I think without him we would have done a lot worse if you look at independents, the voters we need, they like Mike, they want an actual manager, not a bomb-thrower in charge”. The Bloomberg campaign has been accused of being dramatically out of touch with the Democrats and the country at large, for instance, the refusal to accept polls that showed a dramatic lack of enthusiasm for the campaign in favor of in-house polls which supposedly were delivering extremely optimistic reports, the campaign even pulled funding from several battlegrounds in the hopes of expanding the former Mayors surefire electoral college majority. But other factions of the Democrats have not been so quiet, the torrent of ‘told you so’ articles from progressives have already started to pour in, according to one woman in a STACEY-STAN branded hat “If the Democrats wanted to win, maybe they should have nominated a f**king Democrat!” </p>

Kornaki dances across the screen on MSNBC, flipping counties with his magical wand, red to blue, closing the pathways, shutting the door and trapping you inside.

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Michael Bloomberg, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 years of unbridled Trumpism, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have proven that the country was desperate for a return to a more moderate and orthodox government, a theme well captured by the campaign of Mr Bloomberg the billionaire and three-term Republican/Independent Mayor of New York. His lack of Democratic Party credentials may have bolstered his support among independent voters who were able to deliver his victory at the polls.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg was a late contender in the race for the Democratic party nomination, emerging despite ruling out a run for the Presidency months prior, he changed his mind when it seemed like other more mainstream candidates were losing ground. Offering himself as an ‘electable alternative’ and no doubt boosted by the massive amount of his private wealth into the campaign steadily gathering strength by playing up his wealth and centrism necessary to defeat President Trump.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“I. Like. Mike. ” </strong>the supporters piped, hands clapping on thighs. “I. Like. Mike. It was a polite and subdued celebration, all things considered. The crowd had died down from its early fanfare quickly, its energy spent. “We got the result we wanted, it’s clearly time for, an actual President, and that’s what Mike is, he can do the job.”. President Elect-Bloomberg was hardly the first choice for the party, hell he was hardly his own first choice, but he proved able to overcome suspicion from differing inter-party factions, we found more people excited by the selection of Vice-President Elect Abrams, from a quick scan of the campaign’s own website. “If you scan this room it would be hard to find any do-or-die Bloomberg supporters, but we needed him to beat Trump, he appeals to voters that no other Democrat could” And appeal he did, successfully countering President Trump's image as the 'only man who can fix the system', with his own message as the guy who actually can</p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them?

    <p>The New York Times election needle had fully turned now. You flicker the channels, MSNBC their lips quivering Kornacki looks disheveled, searching the board for a pathway, a way out, but there isn’t one. One by one they each trapped shut. The disdain they hold for you, is dripping, from every orifice, Rachel Maddow is conspicuously absent, apparently, she’s had a complete emotional breakdown. And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>

    </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after 4 years of deep-seated conservatism. The President was able to win his second term, winning over enough Americans to support his administration and not elect his opponent, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Mr. Booker entered the Presidential contest by finding the middle road, between anti-establishment progressives and the more moderate old guard with a relatable yet feisty persona, standing on principle, charting his narrow path to victory in the primaries. But all that passion seemed to die down quickly once the general election started and Booker tried his best to pivot the center on a number of issues.</p>
    <p> The Booker campaign believed its path to victory was to be found in reviving the Obama coalition, mobilizing young and African American voters while swaying the center to his cause. But these two objectives became hopelessly muddled, and President Trump and the Republicans were able to brand his campaign a cheap re-run, relying on nostalgic memories of the past instead of the names and faces actually on the ticket. Booker having lost the election means that he will spend the next few weeks as a Senator before handing off his seat in January, leaving his political future uncertain and a return to elected office doesn’t appear to be on the cards for now. </p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The night air was cold, </strong>as the supporters coddled one another in an attempt to warm their spirits. Drooping faces and glum scowls are everywhere. “This year can’t get any worse, I really thought … I really hoped that … well that serves me right.” Many of these people are young, and this is their first political campaign, first mobilized as activists these last four years and now they’ve worked themselves to the bone as a key part of the Booker-Gillibrand apparatus. And to those people, this loss is a big one for them, to have invested so much time and effort into something-a candidate you believe in only for it to end in an unexpected defeat, But still, when asked if they will keep up their political efforts, the response was one and the same. “Hell yes, we will. This isn’t the end, definitely not we’ve got a lot to do to combat whatever bulls**t is coming the next four years.”</p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> The phone warbled, a mix of music and various people making aimless chit-chat. </p>
    <p>“President Trump, this is Senator Booker ” </p>
    <p>He’s only saying that because he’s worried you’d forgotten it, why wouldn’t you have, he’s not important, Phony Cory, putting on another show.</p>
    <p>“Mr President, I fought this campaign on the issues that matter to Americans, such as myself, and I just have to say that you must recognize that our country has to be brought together, it’s been a tough year for this country and…” </p>
    <p>The lecture goes on, and on, carping about his suffering and challenges, You’re polite and listen even after all the things he’s called you, here he is, asking you to be nice to him.</p>
    <p>“Mr. President I hope this is a corner, a corner that our country can now turn…”</p>
    <p>Doesn’t this guy ever switch off, who’s he fronting for, it’s over Cory. Or that’s it, he knows it, this is his last performance, tomorrow he fades back into the background. You tell him you’ve got to go and pass the phone over before he can say goodbye.</p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Cory Booker, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 years of thuggish conservatism, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have voted to turn the clock backward to 2008 and elect the nation’s second black President the progressive New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. His rise to the Presidency, throughout this campaign been paralleled with that of his forerunner President Obama, even by his opponents, but it seems that now those efforts were in vain, after his victory at the polls last night.</p>
    <p>Cory Booker’s rise to the presidency was that of a scrappy underdog, winning the Newark mayoralty and unseating a 5-term incumbent. And though his record differentiated little from his liberal counterparts, he was able to stand out through his savvy usage of social media, connecting himself with the public far better than his primary opponents. And in a time of lockdowns, isolation and racial division, perhaps this son of Newark was positioned excellently to prevail against the normally omnipresent nature of President Trump.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears.

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“We. Will. Rise. ” </strong>the supporters sang to the high heavens. “We Will Rise, We Will Rise”. The night air was cold, but none of the cheering supporters showed it, heartily celebrating the end of the Trump era. “The wall is coming down, thanks to the power of the people, the Trump police state is over”. President-elect Booker has inspired a lot of young people to vigorously champion his campaign, many spurred to take stronger action by the many protests regarding guns, abortion and police brutality, activist movements which Booker weaved into his campaign. “It’s just a great night, with Booker and Gillibrand, this whole thing, it will be like a nightmare, and we’ve just woken up”. Indeed, Booker and Gillibrand have played into their connections with their party's big names Obama and Hillary, a supposed power ticket of experienced Senators to reconnect the Democratic coalitions of the past, and it seems that gambit has paid off, as the two prepare to take high office in January.</p>

Throughout the campaign, President Trump has not shied away from using charged rhetoric, which drew consistent criticism, in his struggle to defeat his opponent. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Defending his language as ‘not-politically correct’. Senator Klobuchar a midwestern liberal Democrat had hoped to use her background to court working-class voters who pulled the lever four years ago for the President, however, despite major efforts to persuade these voters, it seems to have fallen flat and many Democrats doubt the strategy's entire feasibility. </p>
    <p>This strategy may have also been undermined by the controversial decision for Klobuchar to select another woman, Gretchen Whitmer for the VP slot. A move that touched off waves of polling that suggested many Americans were still wary about an all-female ticket. A debate which weighed down the campaign, and will certainly not be replicated by any candidate in the near future. Both Klobuchar and Whitmer will return to their respective elected offices, where their political futures may be in doubt, as their previously high popularity ratings have been wounded by the campaign, and it may be the last time that either woman attempts a stint in Presidential politics.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The night was long and cold, </strong>and growing longer and colder by the hour, these were the faithful, Amy’s passionate supporters who had come to witness her ascendency, only to face the bitter taste of defeat. “It’s really a broken system,” Said one, “She was the better candidate, there is no doubt about that but there are just too many people who can’t see the wood for the trees”. Indeed the Klobuchar campaign has been dogged by scandals, from its run-ins with left-wing activists, and allegations of an at times hostile working environment for its campaign staff. And this audience had no qualms sharing their frustration at what they deem a false narrative. “She’s a genuine person okay? She says what she’ll do and then she does it? And these people in the media, they want pie in the sky, they want extremism, and universal health care, without thinking about the millions of Americans who aren’t on board with that.” When asked if there were any missteps made in the campaign. “Hell no, Amy was the candidate to beat, not afraid of anyone, people that say otherwise, these doubters, outta park it somewhere else”.</p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> The phone whirred like there was a fan or a space heater on the other side. Before the muffled voice came through.</p>
    <p>“Mr. President, are you there?”</p>
    <p>You confirm, once-twice-three times, but the woman must be too deaf to hear you.</p>
    <p>“I can’t quite hear you over here, so I’ll keep this brief.”</p>
    <p>After waiting all this time, you were desperately hoping to relish in her defeat, but instead this, a one-way teleconference … unless?</p>
    <p>“Mr President it appears the campaign is over, you won, congrats and …</p>
    <p>She can hear you, she can, she’s lying, thinks she’s getting one over on you. No, it doesn’t end this way, she doesn’t get off easy, after all this.</p>
    <p>“Now is the task of rebuilding, constructing a new centerground for our politics, okay?”</p>
    <p>She’s embarrassed, probably crying, or demented, out of her mind that’s it, crazy Amy, finally gone off the deep end.</p>
    <p>“I hope you heard that, Mr. President like I said it’s not coming through well on our side.” </p>

While Maddow's gleaming a smarmy sickly grin, while on Fox the word has come down from on-high as all those gutless empty suits stick the deeper knife inn, all while the presses were rolling out the fattest type fonts they could.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Amy Klobuchar, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 years of a malevolent and dangerously machismo Trump, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have opted for an abrupt change of course, and turned to Minnesotan Senator Amy Klobuchar, an unabashed moderate Democrat, who flexed her supposed connections with rural white voters, as the key to winning back the White House, a strategy that she doubled down on by picking Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as her vice-presidential candidate. A move that stunned pundits across the country who suspected she would opt for a more conventional (ie Male) nominee, a suggestion Amy strongly rejected, “This isn’t about identity politics, it’s about who’s the best candidate, man or woman”. </p>
    <p>Klobuchar’s candidacy, faced a number of obstacles, from her announcement in blizzard-like conditions to poor initial polling. However as larger candidates fell under scrutiny the campaign built up what it dubbed “Klomentum” To a come-from-behind triumph, with a message tailor-made for more rural audiences, she hoped would undercut President Trump’s appeal among some of his base. A mission that has been accomplished, and now for the first time in American history, should Speaker Pelosi win another go at the gavel, the three most powerful people in America will all be female.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“AMY, AMY, AMY </strong>The crowd rhythmically chanted, hands clapping away in the frigid breeze “AMY, AMY, AMY…” Pleading for their candidate to emerge after the latest batch of results, seemingly confirmed victory. These are Amy’s core devotees, seemingly some of the most loyal supporters I’ve seen, well other than those in President Trump’s camp. “She can get things done, she’s a hard woman, who knows how to get things done” trumpeted one, a teamster. “We’d be here, rain or shine for that woman, and she hasn’t let us down yet”. Klobuchar has come under flak especially during this election for her ‘sub-par’ treatment of her staff, leading to frequent turnover. But, confoundingly the campaign found a way to turn this into a positive, a work-horse, who doesn’t tolerate subpar productivity from anyone, and to her most faithful backers, her sometimes icy persona has been rebranded “Amy is a stone-cold B***ch”. And the paring of her and Gretchen as the cure to the near poisonous levels of male chauvinism in the White House has been hard not to notice in this campaign, a battle of the sexes. </p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after 4 years of an often volatile administration, the President's message proved strong enough to break through with the electorate and gift him a second term in office. It’s been a dirty campaign, to say the least, but in the end, President Trump secured a victory against Mr O’Rourke better known as Beto, a Texan Democrat whose rising star candidacy catapulted him to the front of the pack, only for his campaign to stumble almost as soon as he captured the nomination.</p>
    <p>Beto’s campaign bet it all big, on youth turnout and a mission to flip independent voters that went for Trump in 2016. However his campaign message was muddled, his ‘Punk Rock’ Democratic aesthetic wore off under the heat lamp of a national campaign where his stance on the issues wavered, and his initial pitch of being a moderate electable democrat was severely undercut by his stance on lightning rod issues like, the Supreme Court, gun rights and constitution. And the Republicans and the President were happy to highlight O’Rourke’s most notable achievement, being a losing candidate. According to a poll a week before election day, the single word most Americans attach to Beto is ‘Loser’. While his running mate Tammy Baldwin will return to the Senate, Beto’s political future is very much in doubt, and there are no indications yet that Beto will seek future office. </p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The air was stale, bitter and uncomfortable. </strong>This was the desert, and these pilgrims were doomed to wander for another 4 years. A crowd who were invigorated for weeks by polls that showed large advantages for Beto, glimmers that pointed toward a landslide victory, had all withered away now. “I’m devastated, he had it man, he had it! This felt like a sea change moment, but there is so much, voter suppression, it’s hard to tell right now … we’re just waiting”. This was supposed to be ground zero for a ‘youthquake’ a key demographic of the Beto campaign, “He was the only f***ing candidate willing to say s**t about guns, real life or death problems, we can kiss anything on that goodbye, no Democrat who wants to win is gonna talk about that again”. Beto’s loss however has opened up a the doorway to a flood of internal party criticism that Beto at times seemed entitled to the Presidency, “For a guy with no record, no achievements, no plans, he has the arrogance of a movie star, he let us down, and should just go away and never come back.” </p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Robert ‘Beto’ O’Rourke, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 extremely turbulent years, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have turned towards a rising star within the Democratic party. Mr. O’Rourke a self-described ‘Punk Rock Democrat’, better known simply as Beto, has little in the way of political experience, he will be the first President since James Garfield whose greatest government experience was in the House of Representatives. But it was his long-shot 2018 Senate Race that distinguished him, with slick messaging, a charismatic candidate, enthusiastic supporters and a strong stream of donations, Beto turned a landslide loss, into a close-run thing. </p>
    <p> Democrats desperate to defeat President Trump turned to Beto as a candidate who promised he could deliver just that. By driving up turnout among younger voters by channelling outrage at the failure of the U.S. government to prevent mass shootings which positioned gun rights as a key issue in this campaign. The Beto campaign also sought to spike turnout among Latino communities, through strong criticism of President Trump’s effort to build a wall on the southern border, these combined efforts making up BETO Method. An electoral coalition that appears to have been enough for President-elect O’Rourke</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“BEE. EEE. TEE. OH!” </strong> The fans thumped out as the music throbbed out of the speakers. “BEE. EEE. TEE. OH!” It was a lively and passionate night, matching the lively and passionate spirit of the Beto campaign. Beto as a candidate could never be pinned down, the speeches were vibrant, bouncing from topic to topic, the rhetoric soaring, the applause frequent. “His heart was in it, all the way” said one supporter, “He’s really, really earnest, I knew from day one. He was going to be President, just look at him.” It seems like O’Rourke was able to capture the discontent of a generation, perhaps owing to his roots in punk rock himself, his rallies were festival-like, the issues themselves less important than his vigor for confronting them. “He’s real, he knows our country is f***ed up and isn’t afraid to say it”. Indeed, profane language has become a feature of this unadulterated campaign, and already some networks have been told to prepare to censor upcoming speeches of the candidates, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that</p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>

    <p>The New York Times election needle had fully turned now. You flicker the channels, MSNBC their lips quivering Kornacki looks disheveled, searching the board for a pathway, a way out, but there isn’t one. One by one they each trapped shut. The disdain they hold for you, is dripping, from every orifice, Rachel Maddow is conspicuously absent, apparently, she’s had a complete emotional breakdown. And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States after a roller coaster of an administration has defeated his opponent Andrew Yang and secured a second term of office. The Democratic candidate Yang was a dark horse candidate, who swept in to win the party’s nomination over the heads of a swash of more establishment figures, much like how Mr. Trump did 4 years ago with the Republicans, by promising a new economic vision that was laser-focused on the problems and fears of automation and artificial intelligence. </p>
    <p>After winning his party’s nomination, Mr. Yang sought to build bridges across the political spectrum to groups that have been drifting away from the Democratic party, white-blue collar voters who are anxious about rampant automation, and inviting non and third-party voters into his campaign. However, it appears to have fallen flat, as infighting among Democrats and doubts about his candidacy even between him and his running mate came to the surface and hobbled his candidacy. Mr Yang’s loss leaves his movement in an uncertain position, he has successfully introduced the issues of automation and UBI into the realm of normal politics, but as for his political future, it’s entirely unknown, while he has brought many new faces into the Democratic party and he could pursue future political office, it’s uncertain if his movement will follow. </p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>Reality’s weight fell heavy. </strong>As all the hype and high expectations finally made contact with the real world. These superfans, the beating heart of the Yang Gang, believed to the last minute that the polls were wrong, that the despondent rumors leaking from the corners of the Democratic party were all wrong. But they weren’t, the facts had born out, and the fighting spirit of the Yang Gang simply did not meet expectations. “It’s sad, that the country isn’t ready to get serious on these issues because they will destroy our country, beware America the robots are coming.” It was this kind of rhetoric that Democratic party higher-ups were dooming their chances to defeat the President, while the party was losing ground throughout the country among its unenthused traditional voter base. But still, there is no love lost in this room for the candidate, who insists that they will follow him wherever he goes next, “We were Yang Gang Yesterday, we will be tomorrow and the day after that, and the day after that.” </p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> The phone blinked.</p>
    <p>“Hello? Mr President?” </p>
    <p>There he is, that weak little man, thought he could step up to the plate, but he couldn’t even pick up the bat. </p>
    <p>“This was a campaign of ideas, and people have seen a lot, I think we’ve opened a lot of eyes on these vital issues” </p>
    <p>Oh, yes Yang, we’ve opened some eyes, to how moronic the Democratic party truly is. In picking you as their nominee.</p>
    <p>“It might surprise you, but I wish you well, I wish and hope you have good fortune in your second term, because when you succeed, the whole country succeeds” </p>
    <p>He’s out of it, dreaming, he’s irrelevant, always was, always will be, and this conversation just got very boring, you wish him well too, and tell him that you’ve got somewhere else to be now. </p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Andrew Yang, once considered the ultimate Darkhorse candidate has been elected the 46th President of the United States, the first Asian-American President ever elected to the office, and the 2nd President to enter the office despite 0 years of government or military experience, 2nd after of course President Trump. After 4 years of mismanaged government, Yang entered the Democratic race on a political platform focused on what he called the ‘war on normal people’ focusing on lingering economic fears of the American people, issues he claimed establishment Democrats were unable to solve.</p>
    <p> His focus on automation, artificial intelligence, and of course his signature pledge universal basic income. Were not traditional campaign themes, but ultimately proved successful at building a new electoral coalition, by successfully garnering very high youth turnout, bringing home Obama-Trump voters, and dissatisfied members of Trump's MAGA base, who feel he failed to deliver on his promises on economic rejuvenation and embraced Yang as a new vehicle of that change. All while building a loyal, dedicated, and energized base of his own.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“YANG! YANG! YANG!” </strong> It was electric, a pure electric cloud whipping up the audience into a righteous fury. Bouncing on the balls of their feet, it was a mixed crew of supporters, old guard Democrats, who reluctantly got behind Yang’s campaign, a collection of first-time voters who were drawn to his unorthodox movement, and a lot of young people, former Republicans, Independents, Libertarians and Green Party supporters who flocked to the wave making Yang-Sinema Ticket. “Everyone ignored him, the media was dead set to keep him down, all the polls, but this was a revolution, the politics of people has won tonight”. It’s been quite a ride for Yang, who entered this race entirely unknown and whose campaign was not the most orthodox or smoothly run we’ve seen as the candidate was accused of being too online-centric and ignoring traditional Democratic voters, however, Yang has proven the doubters wrong tonight and has injected an unknown, technocratic ideology into the veins of the country.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after a daring and fiery 4 years, he has defeated the Democratic nominee Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who won the Democratic party nomination off the back of her foreign policy stance, which firmly opposed the President's favor of militaristic brinksmanship. Easily contrasting his own, fiercely unilateral visions of United States hegemony to Mrs. Gabbards embrace of isolationism and deference on the international stage.</p>
    <p> After winning the party’s nomination, Candidate Gabbard struggled with internal bouts with establishment Democrats who were openly hostile to some of her policy stances. The Gabbard-Brown campaign eschewed a traditional campaign and instead focused on winning over disaffected Trump 2016 supporters, and motivating young voters to the polls by pointing to President Trump’s status as an existential threat to the world, citing the President's militarism, and the perceived nuclear threat, frequently citing that a second Trump administration might mean World War III. However, it seems this tactic has failed as the President was able to lean on these actions as patriotic and necessary compared to the supposed ‘cowardice’ of Gabbard. What does this mean for Gabbard going forward? Well come January she will not be a member of Congress and it is uncertain if she has a political future within the Democratic Party given her own attacks on the party’s upper echelons.</p>

I’ve seen tears at elections, I’ve seen faces of horror, but these people are wearing their death masks tonight. Many who have never voted Democratic before, first-time voters or even Trump voters have turned to Tulsi as a legitimate almost savior figure for the country, undeterred by the scandals, apocalyptic rhetoric, and defections from within her own ranks, these were the loyalists, where these people go from here is unknown. “The establishment knifed Tulsi, it goes to show that it’s all a f**king conspiracy, nothing will ever change in this country, they just want to print money until the bombs drop, and believe me it won’t be long now.”</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> The phone whirred, with a single voice and dead silence on the other side.</p>
    <p>“President Trump, I have to offer my congratulations” </p>
    <p>She’s upbeat, or at least feigning it, forcing a gruesome smile through a sleaze smothered smile.</p>
    <p>“It was a hard-fought campaign, and the better man certainly won”</p>
    <p>She’s serious. Not putting this on, must be some kind of psychosis, perhaps she is as crazy as you told everyone she really was.</p>
    <p>“Our country has great challenges ahead and anything I can do to ease that, well I’d be happy to do that”</p>
    <p>You can’t be fucking serious, she’s asking—begging, for a job now, after you put her out to pasture, a loser like her?</p>
    <p>“I think it would be great for everyone if in the spirit of unity, we put the campaign behind us and tried something, I think it would be beneficial for the country … and your administration” </p>
    <p>She falls flat on her face, and now here she is, on her knees, praying not to be thrown out in the cold. So you throw her a bone.</p>
    <p>“Mr. President, I’m only a phone call away”</p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Tulsi Gabbard, the Congresswoman from the 2nd District of Hawaii, has been elected the 46th President of the United States, the first woman, and the first woman of color to win the office. After 4 years of reckless and harmful governing under the Trump administration, Americans have turned their heads toward a different form of leadership. Mrs. Gabbard’s campaign was heavily focused on the President’s dangerous foreign policy, which she claimed was extremely reckless and immoral, which allowed her to ride to victory over her Democratic primary rivals and ultimately to the White House</p>
    <p> She was able to mobilize her supporters and sway Democratic voters and the nation as a whole with her much more isolationist foreign policy program that went further than anyone else in the Democratic field, specifically the President's Middle East policy, which she argued was unconstitutional and dangerous, arguing that President Trump had put the country on a path for World War III. Gabbards commitments went even further than most Democrats wanted and rankled the party's old guard, but it was a small price to pay in return for delivering the White House .</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“TULSI! TULSI! TULSI!” </strong> The crowd thundered, wrapping their hands together in succession. Jubilant, joyous, ecstatic in victory, secure in their morale victory, raising Tulsi Gabbard from the House of Representatives to the White House thanks to the strength of her convictions. “We don’t want these wars, and we’ve proven the American people don’t want them, so much blood being spilled, it’s over, we’ve won”. President-Elect Gabbard was able to position herself as an isolationist war veteran, who vowed to end the Trump administration's militarist adventurism and sought to turn the President's own supposed anti-war rhetoric against him and grab a significant slice of the MAGA base with her, and from a look around she seems to have found some success. “I voted for Trump in 2016 because I wanted the forever wars to end, he caved to the neo-cons so I hopped on the Tulsi Train and never looked back”. Let’s see if President Gabbard can follow through on her hefty promises.</p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy.

    <p>The New York Times election needle had fully turned now. You flicker the channels, MSNBC their lips quivering Kornacki looks disheveled, searching the board for a pathway, a way out, but there isn’t one. One by one they each trapped shut. The disdain they hold for you, is dripping, from every orifice, Rachel Maddow is conspicuously absent, apparently, she’s had a complete emotional breakdown. And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Donald J. Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after 4 unproductive and uncertain years. The President has overcome all that and secured victory against his opponent, and he probably only has her to thank for that. Former Secretary Hillary Clinton has failed her comeback bid for the Presidency, a Presidential nomination that most of the American people have dreaded for years, as these two candidates have easily proven themselves the least popular major party candidates outpacing only themselves four years ago.</p>
    <p> This has been a grievance and spite-filled election, where the issues almost totally fell away, in favor of a grudge match between two people most Americans were not enthused by. Hillary Clinton’s campaign rolled through the democratic primaries despite massive internal party opposition from those uncomfortable with a 2016 rehash. And despite what at times felt like an inevitable victory for her party,  defeating the historically unpopular Donald Trump, she failed to rally the party behind her, and establish any shred of an agenda for her Presidency, instead, she has continued to harp on the 2016 election and legitimate but not permanent questions surrounding President Trump’s election and association with the Russian government. While her campaign stalled under another torrent of brutal attacks, when Democrats look back at this election, I think they’ll all be asking how on earth they messed this up a second time.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>It was icy, an intolerable icy frost that had landed. </strong>These people have been here before, frozen out of the country they thought they lived in ruthlessly torn away without any regard. They were stronger people now, hearts hardened by the grueling campaign, but they still yearned for victory, a victory they were certain was theirs. “It’s been stolen, we know it, all the media, the polls everything, it was ours, it was four years ago but that was the Russians, and they’ve done it again.” There is a lot of denialism here, still fresh as the last states are called, these superfans have been extremely suspect of the President's actions, and his attacks on the voting system have become clear signs of ‘election interference’ by the President and his entourage “We saw it, and have been calling on all Democrats and the media to pay attention because that’s what this is, they did it last time, why should we expect different this time, stealing it from Hillary”. There has been a lot of anger at the media from the Clinton camp as well as progressives for not supporting the Secretary’s comeback bid, despite his win, Americans are still extremely skeptical of the results and a Trump second term, and one wonders if it’s possible to bring this country together at all? </p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady, New York Senator, Secretary of State, and the Democratic Nominee of four years ago has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 disastrous years, the woman who many Americans and pundits had long considered politically dead, has proven the country wrong, with her defiant comeback. Corralling her dedicated fanbase within the Democratic party to once again take the party's nomination, with a simple refrain “Re-elect Hillary Clinton”. They said it couldn’t be done, and many of her allies had since turned against her, as the only candidate who had and could again lose to Donald Trump, but tonight she showed the doubters wrong, reframing the 2016 election as an ahistorical error, pointing toward the failed agenda of President Trump, and herself as the opportunity for the nation to course-correct from the disaster she could have prevented.</p>
    <p> And it looks like the country is in widespread agreement. As Hillary Clinton successfully rebuilt the Democrats winning coalition that narrowly cost her the Presidency last time. This was a truly historic night, the first Presidential rematch since 1956, Hillary will be the first woman-President and though this election has not exactly been policy-focused, we’re certain that President Clinton has much in store for the country she has been running to be President of for the last 12 years. </p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose?

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“HILLARY!!!!!!!!”</strong> The superfans blazed, without a dry eye in the auditorium, as the fireworks lit the skies in bright white bursts. Illuminating the faces in the crowd. Their spirits lifted all at once, from a 4 year-long depression, passions fully aflame. “It’s been too long, this was her moment, her time”. These are the die-hards, who never gave up on their candidate, “We’ve had a Russian stooge in the White House, that orange maniac, and now it’s time for a real President. Hillary … she’s the boss now.”. Yes, a lot of people assumed that the pantsuit nation died 4 years ago, but no, it lay dormant, waiting for its standard bearer to return, and return she did, with a vengeance. Many in the punditry have tried to dissect what the difference is between the Hillary of 2016 and the Hillary of 2020, but the difference is clear from the ground, this is a battle-hardened Hillary, she and her supporters have loved and lost, and were determined not to a second time, without a single grudge or slight against them forgotten, all those who doubted she could be the one to defeat Donald Trump, probably have their names on list.</p>

    <p>The New York Times election needle had fully turned now. You flicker the channels, MSNBC their lips quivering Kornacki looks disheveled, searching the board for a pathway, a way out, but there isn’t one. One by one they each trapped shut. The disdain they hold for you, is dripping, from every orifice, Rachel Maddow is conspicuously absent, apparently, she’s had a complete emotional breakdown. And on Fox, they’re equally astonished, but the smiles are wide as they flicker the map, a mighty sea of crimson, on-screen with those hallowed words branded.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that against all odds Donald John Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after an administration like no other, the Republican candidate overcame what seemed like overwhelming and unsurmountable odds to secure his second term of office, defeating his opponent former First Lady Michelle Obama, in an election that has stunned almost everyone. Mrs. Obama entered the race reluctantly, following the chaos of the Democratic convention, chaos it seems that voters haven’t forgotten, and struggled to define herself on the issues despite her candidacy being widely supported within the party, and her general popularity with voters at large leagues ahead of her opponent, perhaps her political naivety proved her Achilles heel.</p>
    <p> The President and his supporters have already come out in force to mock the many who rated his chances of winning a second term at less than 1%. Some late polling did show a surge for the President, especially after the debate but, often these were outliers. The Democrats came out of the convention confident, with a highly popular candidate facing off against the least popular President in modern history but perhaps they squandered it, general polling failed to pin down any specific policy on the Obama-Cuomo ticket, and like it or not, President Trump had real policy to point to, while Democrats have spent a lot of time trying to investigate the President and not a lot building their own case for government. Nonetheless, the president's shocking turnaround will be a gut punch for Democrats, and who knows what will become of them. It’s extremely unlike that Michelle will return to national politics and Governor Cuomo, well the recent allegations against him have tarnished his reputation greatly.</p>
    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>It was crushing. A deep and soul-crushing loss. </strong>As if the whole crowd was being simultaneously pressed, grinding their feet into their shoes, and down into the earth. As if gravity had increased many times over until any effort to even stand became a fete of strength. For truly, all hope had been lost. These crowds, braving the virus and the weather to be here together, for an inevitable moment of reprieve, for it to be taken like this was to be widowed by defeat. This was a crowd despondent, one woman had discarded her Obama 08 glasses, and the Obama 20 hat simultaneously “I … this … it doesn’t make …how?” It’s an almost universal feeling, this was a victory celebration so choreographed they had timed the moment when the balloons would drop, when the music would play and the fireworks would be lit. So confident of an early night some were scrambling to cancel next-day celebrations, and many others who had reoriented their lives around the campaign are now lost. “This was our way out, I don’t know what happens next … I suppose I have to check if my passport is up to date.”</p>
    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>

    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech. Mike reaches out to shake your hand, it’s icy cold. You thank him, perhaps it’s genuine.</p>
    <p>Buoyant staffers, advisers, and visitors, phase through the halls, the draft of your victory speech presented, but you need to wait, you want to hear it from them first.</p>
    <p>The family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in your image. Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>
    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>
    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care. Mark says we should deliver the speech now, that the networks are all covering the empty podium, the full spread.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p> But it wasn’t Michelle, not even that slimy greaser, Cuomo.</p>
    <p>It was Barack.</p>
    <p>“Uuh, Mr. President?” </p>
    <p>Even you aren’t so base as to not answer with the same cordial refrain.</p>
    <p>“We’d just like to say, that it was an excellent campaign, well run, and Michelle and I…” </p>
    <p>There isn’t a hint of anger or frustration in his voice, perhaps it’s a front. The smartass can’t admit when he’s been beaten.</p>
    <p>“Uuh, the country, it’s been through a whole lot, these past four years, uhhhh and we want to say that going forward, in a second term, things change…” </p>
    <p>You don’t need some life lesson from a poor sap and his loser wife; but, why isn’t he upset? Did he want her to lose? Couldn’t stomach being outshone Barrack?</p>
    <p>“They say there’s nothing quite so ex, as an ex-President¸ but I think this will help...” </p>
    <p>We’re equals now. No, I’m better, all you had to do was beat that deadbeat McCain and moron Romney, I’ve torn down giants. Don’t you get that, you sanctimonious, low-IQ, uppity, Chicago huckster!</p>
    <p>“You’re not running for anything anymore, so it can’t be about you…”</p>
    <p>From him! A lesson in humility, from him! You don’t have to listen to this garbage, so you shut the phone off.</p>
    <p>Sitting alone. Utterly incomparable.</p>`)

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Michelle Levaughn Obama, the former First Lady, to President Obama has been elected the 46th President of the United States, the first woman and the first woman of color ever elected the esteemed position. After years of American Carnage, wrought by President Trump and his Republican cohorts, who have run our government ragged these last 4 years, this disaster in chief has finally and spectacularly imploded. Destroyed by the magnificent President-elect Obama, who Americans have turned to.  A woman who managed to bring some grace and splendor to a truly dismal election season. Without even running for the party's nomination, she was instead drafted for the nomination at the convention. After the party's disastrous primary season ended in catastrophe, the ‘Draft Michelle’ movement started small but gained massive momentum after a number of high-profile Democrats including Governor Cuomo, signaled their support for her as the only viable candidate at the open convention. </p>
    <p> Her reluctance to serve, has not dampened the voter's support for her, and despite President Trump’s massive funding and infrastructure advantage going into the fall, it was the Obama-Cuomo ticket that firmly led in the polls up to election day. President Trump and the Republican party's feeble effort to tar the Democratic slate as lacking substance failed to change the minds of voters, who flocked to her unique and optimistic candidacy, which began to gain considerable support, even in previously considered Republican strongholds. Mrs. Obama has succeeded, winning what was considered by many Democrats an unwinnable election and wiping the slate clean on the Trump disaster.</p>
    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>“YES! WE! CAN!” </strong> The old Obama mantra, vibrated through the overjoyed audience “Yes, Yes, Yes We Can.”, their spirits lifted higher and higher with every rendition. These Obama supporters have been certain of victory since they got here. But as the dials twisted in their favor and as all the commentators moved one by one to call the race, everyone is still wearing the joy of the moment, on their faces. “This is it,” said one woman clad in both Obama 08 and Obama 24 memorabilia. “It’s like all our Christmas’s came at once, first woman, first black woman, and an Obama. The future looks very bright right now”. For Democrats, this is a monumental achievement, especially after that truly disastrous primary process, with some 30 candidates all vying for what looked like a lost cause, only for Michelle Obama to deliver them this monumental victory. “We were getting ready to leave the country, we were literally looking up New Zealand, in the process of working things out”. “What happened? What changed your mind about leaving?” “Michelle happened.” </p>
    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>

This place, it's a joke, the marble columns, chandeliers, and paintings, it's all just cheap theatre, set dressing while all the real power lurks in the wings, commanding the lights, conducting the music, writing the lines.

    <p>Where they once were the walls are smooth and bare, without any evidence of a door having ever been there, groping for a door handle results in nothing. Crossing over the other side of the room, there is similarly nothing, not even an outline, so you pound and wail and beg, but no one comes. No-one cares. How much time passes is uncertain, the clocks having been smashed so completely looking out the windows there is only a dark thick fog, that only reflects the oval prison you are trapped in.</p>`)

But they wouldn’t throw out the phony ballots, we had to show them, how mad our people are about this. They don’t want the election stolen, some people get hurt, and some people get shot, but those were Antifa people, not our people. If they all just came out, Nancy and the rest, and admitted to everyone the horrible fraud that happened, it wouldn’t have come to this.</p>

    <p>Passing through the halls, you can still see them, the handwringers, twitchy wimps scuttering into offices, trying their best to get their testimony straight if things go south. But they won’t, they can’t leave now, we’ve come too far, the orders are out, no surrender, only victory, they won’t steal it from us. A few phone calls reach the right places, the Loyalists, one by one, urging the Vice-President to make the right decision this time all they need is a pep talk from you. “We’re doing so great, you’ve seen the fraud, those people with you can certainly see it, everyone else can, why can’t you?” And soon enough they fall in line, cheered on by the patriot army, confirming your victory. </p>
    <p>It's a glorious day, the rotten media don’t see it. They were perfectly happy when their side rigs elections, but oh you’ve gone too far, how dare you stand up for yourself, how dare you fight back. Complete enemies of the people, calling it an ‘insurrection’ What does that even mean? This is love, great love for our country, tremendous respect for our country, that’s why we’re doing this. Where’s Nancy? She ran into the tunnels but, no one’s really seen her, I wanted to call her, check if she was OK, perhaps we could work things out after all, we could wrap things up, quite quickly and everyone would go home, that would be the patriotic thing to do, but she didn’t so we had to do it the hard way.</p>

    <p>The White House, this stony temple, an ode to the great Roman Republic. Steve says something about that, he’s been working hard on this, him and Roger and Rudy and Flynn, lots of late nights I’m sure, but Steve kept talking about Rome for some reason, that in times like this great men need to stand up for their country, or the barbarians get in. That’s what we’re doing stopping, the barbarians. The phone calls keep coming, as you sit and watch on the many screens, every network, every channel in the world. Lindsay gets through, a little weak, but you stiffen his spine, tell him we’re fighting, and he slinks onboard, McCarthy’s shaken but won’t cross you, McConnell doesn’t even try to get through, but we can win him back, when we've won.</p>
    <p>We’re going to make a statement, it’s great. A real humdinger, the speech of the century. Because we’ve got confirmation from the guys in Justice, the Agencies, even the Supreme Court, Clarence and the rest that the fraud was so strong, and the election so-rigged, and now that the Count’s been stopped it goes back to the states, who have been begging to overturn this rigged election. Ivanka and Jared, they want me to wait, hold off, but if we don’t say something, if we don’t act now, they win.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></p>
    <p>The Vice-President hunkered in some hidey-hole, in the bowels of the Capitol, he’s been calling around, he sounds desperate, he’s on his feet, moving quickly and there’s an echo.</p><br>
    “Mr President, sir.”<br>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;">His breathing is panicked, and his voice is hushed.</span><br>
    “Yes, Mike, I can hear you” <br>
    <p>“Sir you’ve got to release a statement, tell these people to leave, I think things have gone too far”<br>
    <p>“We’re looking into that Mike, but I think these people are quite mad, and I think they have a right to be”<br>
    <p>“Sir?”<br>
    <p>“We had a great election, you saw it, and we were up, very big, things like that don’t just happen”<br>
    <p>“Sir!”<br>
    <p>“These people care about the election Mike, and just want you to do the right thing”<br>
    <p>“Yes, I understand that, but the constitution doesn’t let me, I would but I can’t”<br>
    <p>“You’re wrong Mike, very wrong, you can do it, Jefferson did, it’s your decision, you could save this country”<br>
    <p>“…”<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;">He says nothing, more feet, and bodies move around, soles pounding against a concrete floor, men on the other end, direct people around in haste.</span><br>
    “Mr. President?”<br>
    <p>“How about you come to the White House, the National Guard aren’t coming in, it’s too dangerous, apparently some Antifa brought guns, but I’m sure if you tell everyone you’re making the right decision, pulling a Jefferson, we could help you out, right away”<br>
    <p>“…”<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;">The pounding stops, they’re not moving anymore before four loud, ear-splitting blasts pierce the air. Muffled shouts and screams vibrate through the cell phone, and then more blasts echo, and more and more footsteps pound the concrete.</span><br>
    <p>“Are you ok over there Mike?”<br>
    <p>“…”<br>
    <p>“Mike?”<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;">A thick haze of voices fills the phone, an undecipherable series of yaps and yelps, until one bark gets through loud and clear.</span><br>
    “<strong>STRING HIM UP!</strong>”
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;"> You end the phone call, and think. It's a sad thing but if the roles were reversed, would it end any different?

Even loser Bush got re-elected and he did dumb wars and wasted billions. Not you, you’re settling scores, putting America first. The world fears America again, yes fears, they want us to be politically correct but between you and me, it’s not about respect it’s about fear, it’s about knowing who’s boss, we won't get pushed around by any country even these so-called superpowers. There’s nothing super about them, not at all, at least not for too long.</p>
    <p>The Democrats were weak, pathetic and weak, totally unwilling to make the really tough choices, unlike you, a modern-day MacArthur marching boldly ahead, taking the fight to the enemy, or Patton dueling with Rommel in the desert, real men, the sort of men our country used to have lots of, we’re bringing that back now. President Xi likes to think he’s tough, thinks you’re some kind of paper tiger, WRONG! Throwing his dinky little wooden ships around but they stand no chance, not against the boys in blue, not with our much stronger coalition, he’s made a big mistake. HUGE, he’ll call any day now and raise the white flag, and all these morons and limp wristed pussy’s will be proven so wrong, begging, dropping to their knees to say ‘Oh President Trump we were so wrong’, not too long I think … probably any day now,</p>

The President has yet to make a statement on these incidents, however, we have it on good authority that in Washington it is all hands on deck, the Pentagon is on high alert, the DEFCON status has been reduced to at least Level 3, possibly Level 2. If these reports are accurate, and we have good reason to consider they are senior congressional leaders have been evacuated, including Speaker Pelosi out of, well out of harm's way, should the worse come to pass … Hold on we have a statement, a Tweet actually by the President, let’s take a look. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Xi is a Smart and Tough man, but he has made a very foolish and bad mistake, the United States will NEVER back down, STAY CALM EVERYONE. </span></strong>Hardly Churchillian but that is at least seemingly confirmation of some kind of altercation between the United States and China at least, the mood in D.C. one of political division only days ago after the contentious election concluded, has all but vanished, replaced with, well it’s fair to call it fear possibly dread for what the future of American-Chinese relations holds for the country, possibly the world.”</p>

    <p>The White House has been turned over, occupied by a legion of Generals, strapping gentlemen in blue and green uniforms, idling around every corner, deep in some kind of important conversation. None of them even congratulated you on your victory, what’s the matter with them, didn’t they see what we did, crushed the Democrats, like we’ll crush the Chinese? Instead, all they offer is endless briefings, maps, and charts, can’t they keep it a little more to the point? The only time they have nothing to say, is when you ask a question, really basic stuff like “How are our carriers? Those are important, won us the War right? How are they?” They get stumped, and can’t even tell you if you’re winning, it’s a simple question ‘Who’s Winning?’ but they don’t answer. The news, they say the Chinese have hypersonic; do we have hypersonic? These dumb fucking Generals, if we lose this thing, it’ll be on them, Xi probably has smart Generals, not these dopes who can’t even win a war in Afghanistan, get beat by sheep farmers, and now they’re going to lose this thing and watch, the dirty lyin' media will blame you, watch the New York Times witch Maggie write up some smear, you should giver her a call, set the record straight.</p>
    <p>But, it won’t come to that, forget them, the doubters, the wimps and pussy’s, lining up outside the White House with their chants and signs, they’re just jealous, saying we started a war to win an election, it’s not true, not at all it’s just the phony Russiagate all over again, but this time, we’ve got a strong alliance, Shinzo Abe great friend of mine, he’s with me 100%, the Koreans, Moon with me, ready to stick it to Xi, but biggest of all we’ve got Nancy. We had a great call, a great call of tremendous unity, she told me ‘Mr President, you’re doing to right thing, standing up for Taiwan, full support, she said, you have my full support’ She’s gone now, underground apparently, along with the rest, Melania and … because we … we need to be ready, for whatever may come.</p>

    <p>We’re getting tremendous ratings, Pompeo, his briefings it’s thrilling, like a movie, but the pundits the T.V. people, it’s dark stuff, bad for morale and that’s important in wartime, we don’t need this garbage on the screen, talking about blast zones and all these things, it won't come to that, it’s incitement completely provoking these anti-American riots, we’re losing control of our cities, Xi must be laughing looking at us, after we’re taking him to the cleaners in his backyard he should be the one who’s embarrassed, we’ve seen the footage, broke the blockade, if it wasn’t for these people, the war would be over, frankly we’d be celebrating. You tell the Republicans, sitting in their little mountain hideaway you’re not going anywhere, think of the message that would send, the President hiding in some mountain in Alaska, I don’t think so, let the others run, let McConnell crawl into some West Virginia salt pit, You’re not leaving, no-matter what Mark says, staying right here, You’re probably much safer than they are anyway because … it would be unthinkable.</p>

Pence is gone too, took him and his family, apparently, they’re in the sky now, flying 24/7. You talked, a good talk, not a last talk, certainly, not a last talk, though you can’t remember what he said, it was some Bible Verse, probably quoting Jesus, but you can’t remember which, it was nice, Karen though she was distraught, tears in her eyes as they huddled onto the chopper, you told her to “Cheer up Karen, we’ve got so many tremendous things to do.”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, it’s just that, the news we’re getting is not good”<br>
    <p>“You shouldn’t listen to those people, you know, I’ve taught you that—we’re staying here, because it wouldn’t be a good look, bad for morale, so we have to stay, but things are really fine, Xi is backed into a corner, but we’re ready to deal”.<br>
    <p> “That’s wonderful, but perhaps I think you should join us, the kids really want to see their grandpa”<br>
    <p>“It’ll be soon, quite soon, but I can’t leave the troops, the generals, they need me here, otherwise who knows, things could fall to pieces, so tell everybody, that I’m staying, and it’ll be fine, and we’ll have a great 4 years after this is all wrapped up”.<br>
    <p>“Okay, if you’re sure, I love you”.<br>
    <p>“I love you too”.<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 5em; display: block;">The phone call ends, and you the most powerful man in the world, are left totally alone.

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Michael Richard Pence, has been elected President for a full term in his own right, having been thrust to the top of the ticket following the tragic death of President Trump, Mike Pence has won the 2020 election, and will be able to carry on President Trump’s legacy for his own 4 year stay in the White House.</p>
    <p>President Pence, came to the office, like Vice Presidents before him, at times of tragedy and crisis, the death of President Trump has rattled this country to its very core, especially as he lost his life to the same vicious pandemic which continues to tear through this country. Some wondered that with the President's sudden passing if his coalition would evaporate with him, but it seems that President Pence, who in most places across the country was still printed on the ballot as the Vice Presidential candidate, has successfully steered the ship to victory against the Democrats, however, time will tell, if Pence can keep the favor of the Presidents M.A.G.A. base, who have fought to take over the Republican party these last years or if President Pence will look to build a coalition of his own?</p>
    <p>It's warming, to see his followers, have embraced you, and come together to build a greater flock. It took work, to earn their trust, the familial endorsements, the constant inference of his name, of preserving his legacy, at time it didn’t even look like you were running for President, and some of the more frightening polls show that some still believe he is the President, still alive somewhere, perhaps it’s inescapable, to live under the shadow of such a domineering presence, it was hard at times even for you to recognize the reality of the world you inhabited, even standing so close to his orbit. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The Democrats however,</strong> now there are some lost souls, thrown into hysterics by this disaster, thinking only of themselves, when we have a country that has been so wounded this terrible year. “It’s wrong, it’s very wrong that this is happening we have a President who wants to destroy our country now, take us back on everything, women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights, any right you name it will be out the window in the next 4 years,” Says a tired young woman being propped up by two or three others, “This country is screwed, totally screwed, I used to have hope when Trump died, I thought ‘that’s karma’, goes around comes around but I don’t know what we’ve done to deserve this”, A disturbing look for sure, into the brainwashed youth of today.</p>
    <p>The White House is a blend of excitement and trepidation, your staff, the Republican faithful who march through the White House with their chests pumped out, fuelled with righteous bravado, while the former President's supporters feign joy through gritted teeth. Prepared mere hours ago to throw you to the wolves they now slink through the corridors, and leak their praise to friendly reporters, that sickly worm Stephen Miller leads a round of applause, while the power brokers Murdoch, McConnell and McCarthy deliver their well-rehearsed plaudits, “Time to turn the page” says McConnell his eyes filled with stars.</p>

You try your best to be gracious, but at a certain point the conversation gets a little dry even for you, you didn't come into government to make compromises, you are a warrior.</p>
    <p>The former first family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in his image. Of course, it's all polite smiles to your face, but it is they who wish to wield the inheritance thrust upon them, they see you as an interloper, who has stolen what was rightfully theirs.</p>
    <p>But throughout all these conversations, you can’t escape that voice in the back of your mind calling for you, a bitter, braggadocios, impulsive, vain, capricious and vulgar voice.</p>

    <p>The feeling coursing through your veins can only be described as pure, liquefied ecstasy, hot streams of blood pumping through your chest, making your skin flush and hot to the touch. You feel the ache of vanity oozing out of you as you flicker the channels. MSNBC, where the studio resembles a mortuary as they stare aghast as the results unfold in front of their eyes, to CNN where Van Jones trauma dumps to the audience, “The Republicans had a unifying powerful force behind them, President Trump, millions of Americans love that man, and took that love to the ballot box” And then to Fox, where the real revelry has just begun, praising you, praising all you’ve done to heal the country and honor the memory of the former President.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Michael Richard Pence, has been elected President for a full term in his own right, having been thrust to the top of the ticket following the tragic death of President Trump, Mike Pence has won the 2020 election, and will be able to carry on President Trump’s legacy for his own 4 year stay in the White House.</p>
    <p>President Pence, came to the office, like Vice Presidents before him, at times of tragedy and crisis, the death of President Trump has rattled this country to its very core, especially as he lost his life to the same vicious pandemic which continues to tear through this country. Some wondered that with the President's sudden passing if his coalition would evaporate with him, but it seems that President Pence, who in most places across the country was still printed on the ballot as the Vice Presidential candidate, has successfully steered the ship to victory against the Democrats, however, time will tell, if Pence can keep the favor of the Presidents M.A.G.A. base, who have fought to take over the Republican party these last years or if President Pence will look to build a coalition of his own?</p>
    <p>It's warming, to see his followers, have embraced you, and come together to build a greater flock. It took work, to earn their trust, the familial endorsements, the constant inference of his name, of preserving his legacy, at time it didn’t even look like you were running for President, and some of the more frightening polls show that some still believe he is the President, still alive somewhere, perhaps it’s inescapable, to live under the shadow of such a domineering presence, it was hard at times even for you to recognize the reality of the world you inhabited, even standing so close to his orbit. </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The Democrats however,</strong> now there are some lost souls, thrown into hysterics by this disaster, thinking only of themselves, when we have a country that has been so wounded this terrible year. “It’s wrong, it’s very wrong that this is happening we have a President who wants to destroy our country now, take us back on everything, women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights, any right you name it will be out the window in the next 4 years,” Says a tired young woman being propped up by two or three others, “This country is screwed, totally screwed, I used to have hope when Trump died, I thought ‘that’s karma’, goes around comes around but I don’t know what we’ve done to deserve this”, A disturbing look for sure, into the brainwashed youth of today.</p>
    <p>The White House is a blend of excitement and trepidation, your staff, the Republican faithful who march through the White House with their chests pumped out, fuelled with righteous bravado, while the former President's supporters feign joy through gritted teeth. Prepared mere hours ago to throw you to the wolves they now slink through the corridors, and leak their praise to friendly reporters, that sickly worm Stephen Miller leads a round of applause, while the power brokers Murdoch, McConnell and McCarthy deliver their well-rehearsed plaudits, “Time to turn the page” says McConnell his eyes filled with stars.</p>

    <p>You get a call from the Democratic campaign, it’s short, polite sweet, full of the expected pleasantries, the calls for unity, to cool heated rhetoric, and build a bi-partisan government. You try your best to be gracious, but at a certain point the conversation gets a little dry even for you, you didn't come into government to make compromises, you are a warrior.</p>
    <p>The former first family are the only ones not trying to hide it, they know you too well, molded in his image. Of course, it's all polite smiles to your face, but it is they who wish to wield the inheritance thrust upon them, they see you as an interloper, who has stolen what was rightfully theirs.</p>
    <p>But throughout all these conversations, you can’t escape that voice in the back of your mind calling for you, a bitter, braggadocios, impulsive, vain, capricious and vulgar voice.</p>
    <p>You wait for the calls to stop.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;">Oh Lord, oh my, is this how it ends? It can’t be, we were so close, I’ve worked so hard; suffered so long, for this, this final humiliation. It’s a cruelty, like no other, our country in such total upheaval. It was a task, I was made to perform, what I was chosen above all others to oversee, not to see it set adrift, lose its way like so many who dare to tread foot on the path.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps he was right, these people, the petty punditry, scoffing at you, as you’re prophesized rise is unraveled and ridiculed as a hopeless venture. All that hullabaloo about the sympathy vote, a truly unified Republican party, all a cruel misprediction. And here they come, to pick apart how you failed so disastrously, on MSNBC, Maddow is delighted to inform her audience that, you won’t even be the shortest serving President in American history “That honour will of course go to our ninth President, William Henry Harrison”. Gleaming as the bright blue map shines off her glasses. And then on Fox, they have wasted no time, in throwing you to the lions, how you’ve soiled the memory of President Trump.</p>
    <p>
    <strong>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;">How?<span style="padding-left: 2em;"> </span>
    <span style="font-size: 16px;">How?<span style="padding-left: 2em;"> </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12px;">How?<span style="padding-left: 2em;"> </span>
    </strong>
    </p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Michael Richard Pence, has lost his election bid, after accepting the Republican nomination just last month following the shocking death of President Trump, Mike Pence the 46th President of the United States will serve out the remainder of Trump’s term of office, before handing over to his Democratic successor.</p>
    <p>It has been a hectic few weeks, following the passing of the President, and so little time has passed since that tragic event that many people across the country had already voted for him, and he remained on most physical and even digital ballots nation-wide</p>
    <p>We have lost Presidents, and we’ve lost candidates, but never at the same time, and never so close to an election, the effect that monumental event would have on the election was unknown, would Trump's legion of devoted supporters flock behind the new President, his deputy, or would they abandon him, or worse still believe the many conspiracy’s that the President was somehow implicated in his predecessor’s death or some who claim he isn't even dead, nonsense for sure but combined with criticism for his role on the Corona-Virus taskforce, this rhetoric has greatly hurt the current President politically, and possibly ended his election chances. </p>
    <p>It's a tragedy, the deluge of the former President's supporters, fully garbed in his regalia, wrapped in the flag, the passionate anger that you couldn’t rouse in them, all that reckless rage pouring freely to lay more scorn on you. Their devotion is unnatural, but we’ve all just grown so numb to it now that even beyond the veil, he found a way to deliver his final insult, sitting in judgment no doubt, laughing about how you couldn’t pull it off ‘We were doing great Mike, what happened? You choked Mike, why did you choke?’.</p>
    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>The Democrat’s disciples, </strong>are in ecstasy, bringing down your Presidency before it could even begin, chanting and wailing. “Thank the Lord” one particularly inebriated young woman screams into the microphone of a reporter, “I didn’t think it was possible, after Trump died, I can’t lie I was pretty happy, but then I thought Fuuuuck, now we’re gonna get Pence, and like he’s worse, you know he’s literally the devil, but turns out he was a weak <em>bitch</em>, that Christo-Fascist can kiss my ass.” It’s uncomfortable viewing as the reporter squirms to gain back control over the microphone from the now several women who are wailing obscenities.</p>
    <p>The mood in the White House is toxic, the Presidential campaign has been a disaster, a mix of the former president's most ardent loyalists have imbedded themselves deeply in the woodwork of the White House, embittered that they now have to hold court with you, all too prepared to throw you overboard. But the commiserations also eke there way through, Marc, McConnell, McCarthy it’s earnest and frank and polite. “Sorry, these were tough circumstances”, “You fought the good fight Mike”, “You did everything you could ... it just wasn’t your time” But it was, if now isn’t your time, then when would it be? Did He not speak to me? Was He wrong?</p>

    <p>The First Lady, Karen, Mother arrives on the verge of tears, it strengthens you a little, and reminds of your place and role as a husband and father, just not a President.</p>
    <p> The former first family is gone, leaping over one another to get their jabs in, ranging from the passive-aggressive to the verbally abusive, like little toy soldiers, all wound up, but with no place in the world, you pity them</p>
    <p>Still, it’s a shame, the signs were all there, guiding us down the right path, it’s an indecipherable mystery, and you can’t help but feel your faith shaken, after all, you’ve given, all your devotion, have you not suffered enough, these cuts and bruises, have you not resisted temptation, and stood firm and steadfast, carried many burdens and brought our people closer to His glory and salvation.</p>
    <p>Was all of it not enough? Tell me, please, tell me it was enough.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that in a historic first, the electoral college is deadlocked. As three candidates have divided the vote between them, denying each other the majority. There has been nothing like this in modern American history, and it has prompted days of upheaval, verging at times on chaos. All three parties have been briefing and counter-briefing against each other, litigating the results and trying to build flimsy alliances with one another. From where we stand, we really don’t know where this will end up, the Supreme Court? Congress? We are truly in the dark here.</p>
    <p>This election is a lesson for Americans, just what the danger of third parties can be, the electoral college simply isn’t capable of accommodating any more than two major parties. And It’s fair to say that trust in American democracy is at an all-time low, and when asked on their faith in a recent poll, less than 20% of Americans said they felt the election was ‘Free and Fair’. This has of course been stirred up by the unverified claims of the President, who has constantly stated that he is certain of his victory, and has quote ‘No intention to leave the White House’. Where do we go from here, well, we don’t really know?</p>
    <p>Your people, they’ll come through, they have to, we won’t let them take it from us. These horrible Democrats, it’s ours, and they want to steal it, add votes, or remove ours, they’re moving in the election stealing lawyers. But we’re sure to win because we’ve got the Supreme Court, our judges, they’ll rule with us. The inauguration is already set, Pelosi, she refuses to invite, but it doesn’t matter, we’ll hold it on the eclipse, they’ll come by the thousands—no, millions. And show the swamp that we’re serious, they can’t be allowed to steal it from us. While on T.V. these liberal dopes, they’re marching, dressed up like Antifa, burning, looting. It has to stop. On CNN Anderson Cooper wanders through so-called ‘Camp Freedom’ a horrible little tent city on the National Mall in D.C. its total lawlessness, everywhere, coming for all of us, a Marxist takeover according to Tucker.</p>
    <p>Your advisers are working desperately to get the votes for this contingent thing, but you’re not too focused. I told Murdoch, and McConnell and McCarthy, just say I won, and I’ll take it from there, what don’t they get? The Supreme Court will wrap this whole thing up, just like they did for Bush, if not, then we’ll have to fight.</p>

    <p><span style="padding-left: 5em;"><strong>We can now project</strong> that in a historic first, the electoral college is deadlocked. As both major candidates have gathered 269 electoral votes each. There has been nothing like this in United States history and it has prompted days of upheaval, verging at times on chaos. There have been reports of sporadic violence at vote counting facilities, as supporters of the President and other groups have clashed. And now both the Republican party and the Democrats are moving to litigate thousands of disputed ballots across nearly a dozen states. From where we stand, we really don’t know where this will end up, the Supreme Court? Congress? We are truly in the dark here.</p>
    <p>The closeness of this election has led to the emergence of many election-related conspiracy theories. It’s fair to say that trust in American democracy is at an all-time low, and when asked about this in a recent poll, less than 20% of Americans said they felt the election was ‘Free and Fair’. This has of course been stirred up by the unverified claims of the President, who has constantly stated that he is certain of his victory, and has quote ‘No intention to leave the White House’. Where do we go from here, well, we don’t really know?</p>
    <p>Your people, they’ll come through, they have to, we won’t let them take it from us. These horrible Democrats, it’s ours, and they want to steal it, add votes, or remove ours, they’re moving in the election stealing lawyers. But we’re sure to win because we’ve got the Supreme Court, our judges, they’ll rule with us. The inauguration is already set, Pelosi, she refuses to invite, but it doesn’t matter, we’ll hold it on the eclipse, they’ll come by the thousands—no, millions. And show the swamp that we’re serious, they can’t be allowed to steal it from us. While on T.V. these liberal dopes, they’re marching, dressed up like Antifa, burning, looting. It has to stop. On CNN Anderson Cooper wanders through so-called ‘Camp Freedom’ a horrible little tent city on the National Mall in D.C. its total lawlessness, everywhere, coming for all of us, a Marxist takeover according to Tucker.</p>
    <p>Your advisers are working desperately to get the votes for this contingent thing, but you’re not too focused. I told Murdoch, and McConnell and McCarthy, just say I won, and I’ll take it from there, what don’t they get? The Supreme Court will wrap this whole thing up, just like they did for Bush, if not, then we’ll have to fight.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">It’s important to raise the hard questions regarding the President's fitness for office, but is this really just ageism?</p>
<p>This week has seen a slew of reports into how Joe Biden’s White House functions or should that be dysfunctions. With an uncomfortable focus on President Biden’s mental fitness. The story according to the media is that the 80-year-old President is mentally incompetent, doddering around the White House like a child, talking to paintings, and putting his shoes on backward. This campaign has been so successful that if <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">recent polling</span> is to be believed some 62% of respondents believe Biden’s mental competence is a ‘serious concern’.</p>
<p>But perhaps it is expected to see these kinds of attacks in a country where ageism is rampant, where millions of Americans experience negative comments related to their age (nearly a quarter of all over 45) and many are forced to leave their jobs unfairly. Ageism is without a doubt the last socially acceptable prejudice, where millions of men in their 50’s, 60’s, 70’s, and yes 80’s are deemed unjustifiably unfit for the jobs they have.</p>
<p>When attempting to compile all the supposed evidence of Biden’s so-called mental decline, I can only recall obviously ageist criticisms and stereotypes, his squint, his stiffness, his stutter, and misstatements, ones which the President has made all his adult life. None of these issues are at all relevant to his fitness to be President. And hence we land at the ultimate truth, this is an obvious hit job by the fear-mongering GOP. And these baseless criticisms are only the more slanderous when their presumed candidate is only 4 years younger, and obviously suffering from severe cognitive dysfunction himself, regularly blabbering incoherently and publically, forgetting names, and making blatant misstatements, I say to the Republicans, be careful where you throw these stones, when your own house is not only made of glass but whose foundations are laid upon splintering shards.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Is it just hurting the President politically, or does it represent something more dangerous for the country? </p>
<p>It has been more than three years, since the first cases of the COVID-19 virus were diagnosed in the United States, and last week President Biden announced his intention to veto legislation that would call for an end to the national emergency that was declared during the Trump administration to combat the virus. This was the wrong call by the President. </p>
<p>For months, the White House and President Biden have continued to insist that the pandemic is an ongoing threat to Americans and are keeping in place measures to combat the spread of covid including social distancing, virtual meetings and mask usage are still proscribed by the federal government as key measures to combat the spread, despite recent evidence showing many <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">senior officials and cabinet members</span> are ignoring this advice.</p>
<p>But to many Americans, even to those at risk, the truth is the Pandemic is over, businesses are open, crowds are gathering, and stadiums are packed out. The vaccine program has been a success dramatically decreasing death rates and the worry of serious illness. However, there is a growing cognitive dissonance between the White House and everyone else, the president's mask-wearing, and socially distanced public appearances, even now his Democratic party allies are reportedly <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">pushing the President</span> to cancel these guidelines for the State of the Union worried the appearance could only heightening the rift between the covid-conscious President and the covid exhausted public. </p>
<p>But it wouldn’t just be good politics, allowing Biden to declare a victory over the pandemic and make good on his ‘return to normalcy’ pledge. It would be a tremendous good for the country, when President Trump declared the emergency, it wasn’t just an attempt to save face from the public health disaster he failed to prevent but it was a vast expansion of federal and state power. Trump and other governors like Ron DeSantis or Brad Little were quick to appropriate funds and use law enforcement to enforce lock-down measures, and sideline or remove officials who did not follow their guidelines all without any legal basis. </p>
<p>The pandemic was a blatant example of politicians abusing a crisis, to <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">expand their powers and profit immensely</span> while hiding behind trusted figures like Dr Fauci. Trump who frequently cited other authoritarian countries' harsh measures as the basis of his own, in turn inspired many others like Brazil’s Bolsonaro or Hungary’s Orban to use the crisis to their advantage. And if the emergency were to remain in place through the election season, it would only empower Trump in a second term to further bend the Constitution. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Bernie Sanders’s sweeping healthcare bill has faltered in the halls of Congress, is there a way through? </p>
<p>The White House is quietly preparing for an agenda after healthcare. With progress on President Sanders’s signature piece of legislation stalled, officials, operatives and many within the President's own party are plotting a way through the coming midterms, without the benefit of a bill that would have made generational change to the healthcare system. </p>
<p>For over a year, the United States Expanded Health Care Act, better known as Medicare for All has been the primary focus of the President. Still, in interviews with dozens of Democrats, both those involved in writing the legislation and those who were expected to vote for it, there is a growing sense that Washington's inertia will win out. The White House will have to dramatically scale back its ambitions to get anything done before the upcoming election. </p>
<p>“Hopes of getting this passed are slim, there’s not a lot of hope,” said Colin Strother a party operative. President Sanders bet big on passing Medicare for All, hoping to bank off post-pandemic support for healthcare reform and win passage of the bill while his party controlled the majority, but those ambitions hit a brick wall against first the Republican Senate filibuster and then with wavering Democrats who entered lengthy negotiations to reform or ‘carveout’ the filibuster to pass the bill. And it’s safe to say these efforts have gone nowhere slowly. </p>
<p>Who is to blame? Progressives and, yes the President have not shied away from blaming members of their own party, specifically Sen. Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz) who have both publicly announced they would not support filibuster reform in any capacity, announcements which caused the President to lash out, “We’ve got an enormously popular program, that right now his being held up, sabotaged … It’s no mystery who these people are.”</p>
<p>However in the face of an encroaching deadline, and amid efforts for the President to refocus efforts on other pieces of legislation there has been no retreat from the White House, who are dismissing the pessimistic picture being painted by the media. The President delivered another forceful defense of the legislation in a tense press conference with reporters.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working very hard, to get this passed, month after month, because it’s the right thing. And if Congress fails to get this done, well that would be an immense disappointment, not just for me but for the voters, it would not surprise me if the people who do not vote for this vital reform were to lose their seats. I hope it doesn’t come to that, but we’ll see.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Several men were taken into custody by officers for a supposed attempt to Abduct the Supreme Court Justice </p>
<p>Two New Jersey residents have been arrested after reportedly making ‘extensive’ plans to kidnap Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Planning to break into his house in Washington D.C. having brought zip ties, baseball bats, and hammers and staking out his residence at least twice, according to the Washington D.C. Police Department, which has brought charges on the two men as part of a suspected conspiracy.</p>
<p>The supposed plot was unraveled by family members of the suspects who reported their movements and concerns to multiple law enforcement agencies, and the two men’s social media where the two expressed their support for extremist political violence and directed threats toward the Supreme Court and Justice Alito specifically, according to police filings. </p>
<p>“The two discussed these plans in depth, for assaulting the Justices’ house and removing him from the city and taking him across state lines” court filings read, the plot's ultimate end is uncertain, but the two men’s actions appear to be driven by anger toward the notoriously leaked<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #156082;"> Supreme Court Draft </span> which indicates the Court could be prepared to rule large parts of the 'Medicare for All’ Act as unconstitutional in <em>United Health v. United States</em>, rolling back President Sanders signature achievement and other overarching fears about future Conservative court decisions.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has become more and more a subject of national debate this year and has come under fire by President Sanders and Democratic politicians for its recent decisions regarding Gun Rights, Abortion, and Affirmative Action. Republicans have been quick to pounce on these arrests as being caused by “extreme rhetoric” being stoked by the President and his allies, according to Speaker Jordan who claimed the “White House has encouraged and tolerated threats against our Supreme Court, and now it has successfully radicalized young men to turn their words into actions.”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The Attorney General had demonstrated a level of political naivety that can’t be tolerated in the face of Donald Trump</p>
<p>Garland was never Liz Warren's first choice for America’s top cop. He was a compromise pick for sure, and many of Warren's staunchest supporters were disappointed but came to an understanding with the selection, he was Obama’s choice for the Supreme Court, and nominating him for the cabinet post would be a clear signal that the new administration would not be out to 'move fast and break things'. That after the chaos of the Trump era, what Washington needed was experienced, and steady leadership, and the bland and moderate Garland signaled just that. </p>
<p>But since Garland gathered the necessary votes and sat squarely at the top of the Justice Department, he has failed in his most important duty, to protect the country from its gravest legal threat. He has told reporters time and time again that <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> “I am not out to relitigate the past” </span>and has declined to delve deeper into the Trump years, the allegations of surrounding Michael Flynn squashed under the Trump administration do not require a second glance? When Trump illegally appointed officials to fill posts, those do not merit any prosecutions? The flagrant corruption of the President and his family, would looking into any of that <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> ‘harm our legal framework’ </span> as A.G. Garland said last September and after Jan 6, where are the charges of sedition and treason for the former President and his criminal entourage? </p>
<p>Despite New York A.G. and Georgia’s election commission picking up the slack and finally moving forward with their cases against the former President. Garland has instead in a classic Democratic effort of conceding to the false outrage of the right, has <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> greenlit a Special Counsel </span> to investigate the President for allegations (some over a decade old) of campaign finance violations a cheap attempt to smear the proudly incorruptible Warren as corrupt herself. </p>
<p>Why? Why did Garland authorize this? The only reason is to placate his fiercest critics for not bending to them enough, another pointless attempt to demonstrate the iron wall between the Justice Department and the White House. Surely knowing that next week the former president will only reiterate to his followers that the current President is <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> coming after him and his family. </span> It’s no wonder that Warren determined that enough was enough, and relieved the man of his post, it was a brave move, one she knew would provoke backlash from the usual crowd, but it can’t be forgotten, if he’d have done his job, he’d have kept it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Prices are rising faster than ever, polls show people blame Warren, and her speech has not changed that.</p>
<p>Last month, after weeks of bad headlines and tumbling poll numbers President Liz Warren gathered her closest allies to solicit explanations from them, and how they can act now to turn things around. This occasion was detailed in the Washington Post <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> “Warren is deeply troubled by low polling” </span>. The explanations were a range of ideas, shifting from the typical, unfair media scrutiny, a Republican party dead set on opposing her at every turn, and a general post-Covid slump. But there was one issue that was uniformly raised by all parties, inflation. </p>
<p>From gas to groceries, things cost more, it can’t be avoided. And for the last year, it has been steadily sketched into people's minds, that this is because of the President. The theories are half-baked at best, inflation is much lower in the U.S. than in other comparable economies, student loan forgiveness has no association with the inflation rate, and the relief bills were not crafted by the White House lest we forget and were passed with bipartisan support. But that doesn’t stop at least <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> 64% of Americans </span> from claiming that Warren shares some or most of the blame for inflation. </p>
<p>The White House needed a plan to change the narrative, to stop looking reactive and start being proactive on inflation, hence last week’s national address. Perhaps, the White House erred in the decision, the announcement was hardly breaking news, but for a press corp that has been feverish about the President's supposed lack of empathy on the economy, this was her demonstrating just the opposite. “The American people, families, men, women, and children are hurting, squeezed by higher prices and services”. </p>
<p>So none of this explains the massive backlash the President has received with conservatives proudly calling it the <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"> Malaise Speech 2.0</span>, referencing Jimmy Carter's crisis of confidence speech in the 1970s. But Warren did not condescend to Americans, calling on them to cut back and be more sustainable. No, these Republicans are mad that the President placed the blame for inflation where it actually belongs, corporations. “What we are seeing in these tough times, from big corporations is price gouging, and shrinkflation, less toilet paper in your roll, chips in your bags, this is the hijacking of our economy, taking advantage of a temporary supply crisis”. And cue the manufactured big money backed, pearl-clutching, who insist the President is shifting the blame, passing the buck, in a cynical effort to further dent her approval ratings, the sad part is it appears to be working.</p>

<p>Our Woke Military is being trained to lose the Next War. Wokeness used to be a political nuisance, a small distraction in the domestic American culture war, but now it has grown into a major national security threat, and faster than any one of us thought was possible. </p>
<p>This New York Times Best Seller is demonstrating how our armed forces are being systematically infiltrated and corrupted by Woke and Queer Ideology, following the rest of our country off the cliff edge of cultural decay and weakness. Woke Warriors tells real-life stories of how our military is losing the cultural war within its own ranks. From gender-neutral bathrooms at the Pentagon, to radical trans physicians and doctors on the battlefield in Ukraine. And how Islamophonic Cultural Marxism is being taught in the halls of Langley. </p>
<p>The danger of this culture war within the ranks, cannot be understated. What becomes of a society that has forgotten men, can’t define a woman, and is devoid of masculine leadership? And what other reason could the left have for these changes? Can we afford to surrender our hard-fought freedoms to the mob, or will we have to halt the sissyfication of America by force.</p>
<p>The Author combines these tails of outrage, with his own experiences and anecdotes to provide an incitive look and to bring us a tale so disgusting it must be read to be believed. Because to take our country back from these cultural degenerates, we first need our military back.</p>

e.pages.push(`<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: #FF0000;">The Atlantic </span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> | After Iowa, The President Must Drop Out</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The President continues to insist that he has the best chance of defeating Donald Trump, Iowa said otherwise.</p>
<p>The fallout from Iowa is big, and the outcome despite the White House spin is obviously an embarrassing and terrible loss for the President. For weeks they had been trying to downplay the primary challenge but now they are in a full-blown meltdown. How could things have gone so wrong, for the President to make a third-place showing? Before last week the White House was confident that despite the historical nature of his primary opponent, Democratic voters would still place their confidence and faith in the President at the ballot box, after all, no incumbent President has ever lost a primary nomination, but the facts are in, the Vice President trounced the President.</p>
<p>According to the reporting by The New York Times, the Bloomberg campaign had expected as late as last week to lose the Iowa Caucus, reportedly there was not “Much enthusiasm among caucus goers for the President as opposed to his opponents the Vice-President, and Ms. Cortez” The President had made an attempt for months to cancel the primary campaign altogether or rearrange the calendar to further assist him, but when those efforts fell through all that did was further anger caucus-goers and further harm his chances</p>
<p>This must be the last straw, the President went into Iowa a historically unpopular candidate, his own Vice-President campaigning against him for his failure, and less than 19% of Americans view him favorably, far lower than that of any of his Republican opponents, even former President Trump. But still, there are no indications the President is giving up, and in an act of extreme desperation and vanity is even suggesting that the President would run for a second term, somehow even if he lost the Democratic Party nomination insisting that “President Bloomberg will be on the ballot in November” according the Press Secretary Loeser “We expect as the party's nominee, but it is the decision of the President hw we go forward” .</p>
<p>President Bloomberg has lost his Vice President and major factions of the Democratic party leaving the <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;"><i>DNC in tatters and his staff is in turmoil</i></span>, and he has lost the country writ large, what is the President's response? “Our country was in big trouble, I pulled it out, these things didn’t happen on accident, they happened because of a lot of hard work, others (We can assume he is speaking of his primary opponents) want to shout and protest, well that’s all well and good if you want to get nothing done”. The President tried to smile, but cameras captured the squirming.</p>

<strong>Man Wearing an American Flag Scarf:</strong> Against, Very Against, I mean this is the hill we are willing to die on. </p>

<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> So we’re in DC today, walking around talking to these Coke protesters, they’re here against the fat tax, we’d rather be in Ukraine right now, but we can’t get the credentials, so we’re here instead. There are a lot of soda, do you say soda or Coke? Doesn’t matter, these are Soda fans, lot’s of them lots of trucks, lots of flags, and look right here, official Soda Patriot merch here, [pointing to a coke bottle branded with the American flag] I wonder if the Coca-Cola corporation knows about this, probably not right.

e.pages.push(`<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">VANITY FAIR</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> | What’s The Significance of The Wedding Secrecy?</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Invitations are in hand, but the administration is taking a state-secret approach to most of the details.</p>
<p>The White House will host it’s first wedding reception in fourteen years and a Presidential one at that. There is only one precedent for such an affair the 1886 wedding of President Grover Cleveland to Frances Folsom, and it seems that the Booker administration is taking a page out of the 22nd and 24th President's playbook, extreme omega-level secrecy. </p>
<p>We do not know the specific date of the event though wagers are being placed on a Summer wedding, possibly July, and even the venue, expected to be the White House, the usual occasion for such events has yet to be fully confirmed by either the Presidents or the First Lady’s press Secretaries, so far the government has responded to our inquests with total silence.</p>
<p>Speculation of the coming nuptials has reached a fever pitch, with full cover spreads of the couple to be, but there is still no confirmation on whether or not the press will be invited to the occasion, despite a leaked list of nearly 2000 invitations to the reception being sent, a list that includes former Presidents, movie-stars and even royalty are rumored to be in attendance. </p>
<p>Good Morning America, with help from Vanity Fair correspondence has been testing out and showcasing selections of Cakes, decorations, wedding rings, the music, the ceremony, the flowers and of course the First Lady’s wedding dress all of which the public is clamoring to see for themselves.</p>
<p>Are the White House efforts to cloud the fine details of the big day political? Are fears of an expensive union, in times of economic strain to blame for the silence, folding to the nonsense criticism of his opponents, perhaps? But the President can’t run away from the subject and the attempt to do so is naive, even on a trip to Brussels to boost support for the Ukrainian, Lviv government, he was asked questions about his marriage no less than 18 times (we counted), including by UK Prime Minister Mordaunt. </p>
<p>The United States does not have royalty, but we do believe in fairy tales, and right now what we want is a fairy tale wedding.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The couple, who have been together for 5 years, made the decision to split after long and careful consideration</p>
<p>It was a Washington love story that followed a Hollywood script: But now President Booker and Rosario Dawson have announced that their relationship is at an end. The two’s relationship lasted through a Presidential election, and transition and were seen as very close as the two moved from New Jersey to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Dawson has been reported to not enjoy the overly intrusive and heated political atmosphere and has not been shy about sharing her difficulties adapting to the role of First Lady.</p>
<p>The two announced that it was a “mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together following a process of long and careful consideration” and the offices of the President and First Lady have confirmed the statement but declined further comment. </p>
<p>The whirlwind relationship had been largely under wraps until then-Senator Booker’s Presidential run, a run that Dawson lent much support to, joining him on numerous tours of the country and moving in together. At the start of the Presidential transition, Dawson announced that she would become the first non-spouse to take up the role of First Lady the first to do so since the 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland, placing her acting career on hold. </p>
<p>However the heady toll of Washington life took its toll, fronting a campaign on ending Youth Homelessness and Opioids in the nation's capital, the First Lady was not shy about the torrent of hateful criticisms she received from radical opponents of the President's agenda for supposed immorality (even though the Republicans seem poised to nominate a thrice divorced, sexual predator), much of it racist in nature, especially in her <span style="color: #0F9ED5; text-decoration: underline;">appearance on <i>The View</i> </span>and her often unfiltered Instagram posts. </p>
<p>She was also candid about the strains that the Presidency placed on the two’s relationship, praising her boyfriend's commitment to the office, citing his global trips to bolstering America’s allies in Ukraine and Nigeria in those respective conflicts as well as the President's efforts to pass the Fairer Policing Act  “To have a partner that is giving this country the love and representation and respect that is needed right now leaves me overjoyed” Dawson wrote. "It was an amazing adventure,"</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Klobuchar reportedly vented to friends and aids about Vice President Whitmer</p>
<p>According to a new book, the President repeatedly expressed frustration at her Vice-President calling her unproductive and unhelpful. Telling aids that she believes the Vice-President isn’t interested in assisting her politically, rejecting several tasks the White House wanted to assign her like immigration and electoral reform. </p>
<p>“Klobuchar was angry,” the book says, “This was the President's request, but Whitmer has instead steered her own course, in violation of the unwritten rule for Veep’s as a deputy who loyally follows orders.” And there have been allegations that the Vice President has not vigorously defended the President’s economic achievements. “There is a sense of rivalry between the two, amplified by press outlets all too happy to pit two powerful women against one another.” </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; background-color: #FF4B4B;"><strong><i>NEW YORK POST</i></strong></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> | Klobuchar was against Whitmer as VP, new book reveals</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">“There are millions of people in the United States, why would I choose her … what does she add?”</p>
<p>According to new bombshell reporting by the New York Times Journalists Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns titled “Last Man Standing: Trump, Klobuchar and the Battle for America” , then-candidate Klobuchar was initially very against choosing Michigan Governor Whitmer as her Vice Presidential nominee, passing her over for a Senate College like Cory Booker or Sherrod Brown or even a longshot attempt to coral former Vice President Biden back into the position.</p>
<p>But many from Klobuchar’s inner circle were able to convince her of Whitmer’s benefits, a norm-shattering decision that would sure up Rust Belt voters, but the book also contains many unflattering remarks supposedly made by the President against her VP to be, calling her “Massively overrated” “Not a competent person” and “Just another woman governor”. Comments the White House has pushed back on now.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; background-color: #FF4B4B;"><strong><i>NEW YORK POST</i></strong></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> | Klobuchar irked by Whitmer not ‘rising to occasion’ in tell all book</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">One official said that the President is actively thinking of replacements for her in 2024.</p>
<p>Former White House officials have said the President is extremely frustrated with Vice President Whitmer’s position and is uncommitted to keeping her as her running mate in the 2024 election, a new book reveals. The tension between the President and her No.2 has only gotten worse, as allegations of poaching staff, and malicious leaking have frequently been raised between the offices.</p>
<p>And according to the book this came to a head in an Oval Office confrontation over abortion, messaging, and campaigning. Following the failure to codify Roe V. Wade, Vice President Whitmer campaigned independently and without informing the White House, naming and shaming several Democrats who were resistant on the issue, a campaign that the White House saw as damaging to party unity. </p>
<p>“The President blew up,” the book says “Angry about polling that said that Democratic voters favored the Vice President over her, and attributing it to disloyalty” resulting in a profanity-laden screaming match between the two. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Despite the many arrests speculating the downfall of the patriot movement, it’s stronger than ever</p>
<p>Swathed in tactical gear and packing AR-style rifles, the many armed militias of America, the Proud Boys, Oathkeepers and Boogaloo Bois burst onto the American scene in the Trump years, openly touting their deranged fantasies of armed insurrection. Building an underground network across the country. A movement that culminated in the January 6th insurrection, when MAGA rioters and hardcore militiamen overran police and stormed the U.S. capitol to stop the election of President O’Rourke.</p>
<p>In the aftermath many were arrested, by our calculation over a hundred militiamen have been charged or are awaiting sentencing. The movement devolved into paranoia and many assumed their heyday was over. But instead, recruitment has risen thanks in large part to the age-old recruiting technique for these movements, the specter of imminent gun control. We spoke with 5 recruits of a local chapter of the ‘Eagle Cross’ Militia in North Carolina none of whom offered their identities. Five friends who joined all thanks to as A, a dentist put it “The coming civil war in this country, Beto has an executive order ready to mandate a gun ban, and when that happens what do you think will happen”. </p>
<p>They ate lunch together in the woods and took turns shooting with a trainer’s rifle, aiming the scope at a target 35 yards away and each pulling the trigger, as the trainer called the hits and misses. “No doubt war is coming to this country,” said B, a teacher “These crazies have fully taken over” When asked when this war would happen, they said they couldn’t be sure but said that “next year seems right.” </p>
<p>O'Rourke's promise to outlaw assault weapons may have hit a brick wall in Congress, but his advocacy has certainly raised the issue to the forefront, and it has become sacrilegious for conservative lawmakers not to be seen photographed at least holding one. “Beto plans to DISARM and DESTROY all conservatives” said Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p>
<p>Statements like this were common hiking through the woods of North Carolina, “This is where the Founding Fathers stood,” one member, C, told the others. “I don’t know if y’all can feel it, but I do.”</p>

<p>President O'Rourke acted last night, declaring that the Texas National Guard would be brought under federal control and ordered to halt ongoing construction of the border wall. The President's statement said that Texas was acting unconstitutionally by usurping authority over the nations border, which only the federal government has juristiction over.</p>
<p>The Governor of Texas, Gregg Abbott has been at war with the White House, declaring in a statement last week that an 'invasion' was underway in Texas claiming he had abstract powers that enabled him to defy the U.S. federal government and renew construction of the border wall using the Texas National Guard, calling the Presidents move to halt construction “One of the most reckless and treasonous in history, this country is under attack, and the President is actively disarming us”</p>
<p>This confrontation over the border has lasted weeks, as House Republicans and GOP candidates including the former President have marched one-by-one to accuse the government of failing to secure the country's borders. And when the Vice President made a journey to the border last week, she got into a confrontation with the Governor who refused to allow the states border officers to go through with a planned visit, claiming that the state “couldn’t accommodate her at this time” </p>
<p>Not since the days of President Eisenhower has the government federalized the National Guard against the will of the State Governor, but the President defended the move not as a matter of policy, but of the law “No state has the authority to usurp the Constitutional authority of the United States” </p>
<p> Abbott has not acted on the threat he made to defy the government order, instead as much of the MAGA movement has done, he attacked the move as ‘Tyrannical’, mimicking the language of anti-government radicals like Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene who said that “States must reassert their rights or 1776” , additionally 13 GOP Governors have already committed to taking this issue to the Supreme Court and House Speaker Scalise has pledged to move forward with articles of impeachment over the issue. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The deposition of Vladimir Putin poses a serious challenge for the international community</p>
<p>President Hillary Clinton described the Wagner-led coup d’état in Moscow as entirely a product of an internal Russian power struggle, which the United States claims to have played no role in orchestrating or planning. “We have made it clear, we were not involved, we didn’t need to be involved, and we are still assessing the fallout of this event and looking at the implications of this event, and we’ve yet to reach any definitive conclusions”. </p>
<p>Yevgeny Prigozhin’s military revolt, in which Wagner fighters seized the capital city of Moscow in an armed convoy and began occupying Russian government buildings, is the most dramatic and uncertain development in Russian recent history, one which has sent Russian President, Vladimir Putin fleeing from his seat of power in Moscow, and forced him to call on loyal soldiers to defeat the mercenary army setting up what can only be seen as a serious potentially catastrophic period of civil strife inside Russia, Prigozhin has claimed to reject an offer of exile in Belarus and has begun cobbling together a ‘Patriotic Government’ in Moscow as both he and Putin seek to win various military and government officials over to their respective sides.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Jake Sullivan has warned that there is a big risk of a ‘civil war’ on the horizon for Russia, one in which the United States would not get involved at all, “We are not facilitating nor do we seek to facilitate, either side in this conflict, this is a Russian war” Additionally the United States as announced its support for a $3 billion aid package to Ukraine just this week which including ground, air and anti-air and tank munitions. The long-planned counteroffensive and its successes were referenced by Prighozin and Surovikin in their decision to launch the mutiny against President Putin. </p>
<p>Chief of Staff Abedin answered reporters’ questions on the President's schedule which has seen her engaged with European and NATO allies in reaction to the ongoing developments in Russia “The President has been working round the clock on this issue, night and day, making the bold decisions, and she makes no apology for her unavailability”</p>

<p>RODHAM is the Tony Award®-winning musical that’s making history on Broadway! Created by Shania Hurwitz, who is now the first woman to ever independently win Tony Awards for Best Book and Best Score in the same season, RODHAM has also been named Best Musical (Outer Critics Circle Award), received two Drama Desk Awards including Best Score, and is “unquestionably the most emotionally stirring and joyous musical of the season” (Chicago Tribune).</p>
<p>It’s a given that women have a hard time making it in politics, and it is no different for the first lady, Hilary Rodham Clinton, who fought tirelessly and relentlessly for the rights and benefits of women and girls. We are pulled through her story as she suffers the slights and blows, suffers heartbreak and humiliation, accepts betrayal, and sacrifices all in the service of her own unflappable moral compass. RODHAM is a “theatrical masterpiece that demands to be seen” (Forbes) and a reminder that progress is always possible but never guaranteed.</p>

<p>On January 13th A majority of cabinet members voted to invoke the 25th Amendment, declaring Trump “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” and agreeing with the House and Senate leaders that the President had incited and condoned the riots <span style="font-size: 11px; color: blue;">[31][32]</span>. Once invoked Vice-President Pence was officially sworn in as acting President, a move subsequently approved by both houses of Congress, superseding any possible challenge made by Trump.</p>
<p>The acting Presidency of Pence, was marked by large-scale security operations, designed to ensure that the <span style="color: blue;">Inauguration of President Michelle Obama</span> could continue without further interruption, Activation of more than 30,000 National Guard, the installation of high and low tech security barriers and the deputization of local law enforcement to strengthen the police presence in D.C. Acting-President Pence also commenced a soft transition of the government by requesting the resignation of many <span style="color: blue;">senior and lower level cabinet officials</span>, directed government officials to accept the results of the 2020 election, and also endorsed articles of impeachment against Trump<span style="font-size: 11px; color: blue;">[33][34]</span>.

<p>Pence delivered a <span style="color: blue;">farewell address</span> prior to the inauguration of Michelle Obama. In it, he stressed the importance of protecting the “Peaceful transition of power” and said that the country could never tolerate or condone political violence.

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Republicans are threatening to raise articles of impeachment against Vice President Cuomo</p>
<p>Vice President Andrew Cuomo has so far defied calls from lawmakers on both aisles to resign his office following numerous accusations of sexual assault and his tenure as Governor, which begs the question, will Congress seek to impeach the Vice President?<p>
<p>Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing of either a professional or sexual nature, saying that “the facts are much different than what has been portrayed”. The statement goes on to state that the Vice President has no intention to resign, accusing Republicans of “playing politics, by raising uncredible allegations”, claiming that he has the full confidence of the President to continue in his position. “This isn’t about me this is about damaging our administration, which continues to do the people's work” </p>
<p>The Vice President's insistence that he will not bow to public pressure, is raising the possibility of his coming impeachment. “Cuomo cannot be permitted to stay in the office of Vice-President a heartbeat away from the Presidency,” said Republican minority leader Johnson, we have members who will move quickly to begin an impeachment investigation into his conduct. </p>
<p>So far Democrats have been mostly silent on the issue, though several have broken ranks to say that they believe the Governor's accusers, stopping short of calling for his resignation, for instance, New York Senator Kyrsten Gillibrand and California Senator Kamala Harris has called on the Vice Presidency to resign if the accusations are in any way true, both Senate votes that Cuomo would need if he were to face an impeachment trial. </p>
<p>“The process of impeaching the Vice-President would be messy,” said political consultant Hank Sheinkopf “It would be cleaner if he resigned, but that is the only way of forcing him out, he would be the first Vice-President to be impeached and that would be politically very damaging to the President if convicted even more so. And if Republicans were to get the kind of investigation they want, which would delve into far more than just these sexual assault accusations, that would be nightmare territory for the Democrats.” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">A scathing obituary of Donald Trump, originally published in Rolling Stone.</p>
<p><strong>THE DEATH OF DONALD TRUMP: THE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN MONSTER</strong><p>
<p>Donald Trump has passed now, may all our lives be lighter, our souls slightly lifted on the passing of this great enemy of mankind. Everyone who ever entered his orbit, even briefly, be it for a handshake or embrace came out a poorer man, their reputations forever stained. Even his enemies were forced to submit to his unholy aura, blind, deluded and strange in their own quixotic quests to slay the dragon, a task from which they would always fail and become trapped in a prison of their own embarrassment at falling to this buffoon.</p>
<p>The Trump family has decided against a public funeral, advised of the potential uproar that might occur if any kind of event were to be held in Washington D.C. Awkward scenes of civilians picketing the event, and an unknown number of those who would spurn the invitation. Instead, he will be buried in a mausoleum of his own making, entombed in a family lot, far from the prying eyes of patriots.</p>
<p>Had Trump been in charge of his own funeral, it would have been the grandest affair possible, his own bloated corpse paraded for all to see, as the grand overtures of some epic and delightfully camp show tune ring out to the heavens. One struggles to determine if it is more fitting for his remains to be granted the insult of the mob, and thrown to the wolves, or the one he received, short, quiet, and grey. </p>
<p>It is a testament to the bile that this man has so successfully wrung out of the American populace, that even his death will grant us only a little reprieve. Already his crimes are being forgiven and forgotten, the wells so thoroughly infected by his toxic runoff, it will clot our political bloodlines for generations. We will never escape him, even from his sphinxlike tomb, his curse will hold. Donald Trump has poisoned our country, there is no cure. </p>
<p><i>“And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.”</i><br />

<strong>Jay: </strong>(laughing) It’s a fucking piece of shit.<br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> Yep.<br /></p>
<p><strong><i>DUH DUH, DUH, DUH DUH</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mike: </strong> What even is there to say about this franchise anymore, is there really anything left to beat out of this dead horse?<br />
<strong>Jay: </strong>Yeah you just watch it and think to yourself, ‘How is there another fucking Terminator movie? Is this one connected to the last one? Is it setting up another fucking multiverse? Do I care about any of this?<br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> I can answer that last one.<br /></p>
<p><strong><i>DUH DUH, DUH, DUH DUH</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mike: </strong> This was truly repulsive, with the last one I stopped caring about Terminator, I thought 'Okay this is just another franchise lost to time' ruined by producers and writers who haven’t watched or didn’t care about the first two. But this movie got me to actually fucking hate Terminator movies.<br />
<strong>Jay: </strong>My question is, who is this movie even for? <br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> Yep.<br />
<strong>Jay: </strong>Because it’s not for hardcore fans because there’s no Arnie, there’s no Sarah Conner, it’s a clean slate. And then you put all this shit in here that no one wants anymore, like the multiverse, people are sick of multiverses now, the Flash bombed horribly the Sony garbage bombed horribly, you were late to the gimmick. <br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> You can tell exactly when this movie went into production, and also exactly when they should have stopped production.<br /></p>
<p><strong><i>DUH DUH, DUH, DUH DUH</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mike: </strong> Should we talk about the story?<br />
<strong>Jay: </strong>Why bother, it’s the most cookie-cutter shit, Terminator travels to the past to stop the protagonist, they are just recycling the plot of Terminator 1 again, except the only different part, where they—spoilers I guess for this awful movie, travel to the future to the war, which is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in my life. <br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> It was really terrible.<br />
<strong>Jay: </strong>Awful, gross and sitting there It just made me feel bad for ever daring to care about any of this. <br />
<strong>Mike: </strong> Well that was your first mistake Jay, you expected to feel something watching a movie, is it your first day here? <br />

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Inside the new culture war, that is more reminiscent of the 1800s than you think.</p>
<p>“To those paying attention, politics seems to have taken a sudden turn into the 19th century. Yes nearly 200 years ago the prominent debate of American politics was not slavery vs emancipation, or even the great tariff vs free trade rows, but instead, the debate was about money and banks. All the great men of the day, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, John C Calhoun, and Andrew Jackson spent their political currency questioning the topic of actual currency, and it seems our country has finally gone full circle.</p>
<p>Despite these issues hardly being the kitchen table ones we are told matter oh so dearly in American elections, the greatest and most fiery debate that divides the online left and the online right is the Soft-Money Crypto Left and the Hard-Money Specie Right. Yes, Democrats and the President's embrace and signature of Crypto friendly legislation two months ago, has polarized the issue considerably, combined with President Trump’s broadside attacks on the “scam currency” he made over Truth Social and seeming embrace of a return to the Gold Standard, has similarly polarized the online right on the issue, in favor of hard-money specie currency. </p>
<p>Perhaps politics never changes, but it is hard not to notice the parallels between the 1820s and the 2020s. Just as then, the hard money faction was led by the populist Andrew Jackson, who spurned at his loss of the election of 1824, called the election a corrupt bargain, only to run and win the election 4 years later. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, President John Quincy Adams (an imperfect stand-in for President Yang) decided to stand in support of the soft money and the Second National Bank (see Andrew Yang's support for bailing out Silicon Valley Bank) on the basis that the bank was necessary to stabilize the economy after the Panic of 1819 (see the post-Covid economy).</p>
<p>And just like the 1820s, both sides wield apocalyptic predictions if their side loses this new currency/bank war. President Trump threatened that an embrace of Crypto will lead to a Venezuelan-level catastrophe, the collapse of social security and the death of the stock market, while President Yang has called the idea of a return to the gold standard economically backward, and would put the United States into a deflationary spiral.</p>
<p>One wonders what else might make a comeback from the 1820s, frock coats? Top hats? Or perhaps we could settle the next election with a duel?</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The President may have an unorthodox view of foreign policy, but she has adapted to the realities of the office.</p>
<p>Ever since Tulsi Gabbard was elected president, I have committed to speaking forthrightly about her Presidency, especially when she does something right, and now I’m going to do it again. On Friday, the United States led airstrikes against targets in the Al-Qaeda-aligned forces in northern Syria.</p>
<p>Even for a President who has been extremely hostile to America’s position in the war in Syria, the realities of the office of the President can penetrate even the staunchest ideologue, and those images of absolute horror that we have seen unfolding in Damascus, the suffering children and women as the Al-Qaeda aligned militants swept inside should prompt outrage in everyone.</p>
<p>“These images of brutality, and horror, go far beyond anything we have seen before.” Acknowledging that the United States cannot afford to bury its head in the sand in a conflict it is partially responsible for. “The position of the United States has not changed, we seek peaceful reconciliation, but when acts of barbarity are leveled on a civilian population, it is the duty of the international community to act” </p>
<p>With that conviction, Tulsi took military action and ordered retaliatory missile attacks on the militant bases. The intervention represents a huge move for the President, who championed an isolationist policy, especially in the context of the Syrian conflict. She made it clear that this would not be the beginning of a sustained intervention, these were specific retaliatory actions, emphasizing that she would not expand strikes to target the Ba-athist forces that fled Damascus prior to the Al-Qaeda advance.</p>
<p>Just what was the tipping point in Tulsi’s decision? We can't be sure but it would do her good to learn from the example of Harry Truman, who came to office wholly unprepared for the global responsibility he faced, but eventually learned that in the end, “The buck stops here”. </p>

<p>There is an evil in this country, a deep DEEP evil. The longest war in American history, is over, DEAD. Tulsi killed it, Tens of Thousands of lives WASTED, billions of dollars WASTED. From Bush, Obama, Trump the biggest DISASTER in the history of the world, and this President saw it and said, ‘You know what no., I’ve served in these wars—unlike any single one of these MANIACS in Congress, and no—the war ends’. And now these GHOULS, these right wing GHOULS, have the nerve to call this President a traitor. 20 Years, we killed Bin Laden 10 YEARS AGO!, and now after we end the war, these Republican FREAKS crawl out of the woodwork, alongside these BACKSTABBING, WHIMPERING, ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC Democrats, support this SHAM IMPEACHMENT. </p>
<p>Any single ONE of these Democrats that votes for this, they are on a list folks. And I can promise will be out on their asses, you can forget the cold, they will be in the deepest, most frozen pits of hell, by the time this is over. Depending how far this goes, this could be a coup. We know what the Generals want, they want to stay in Afghanistan, they want to stay in Iraq, they want to stay in Syria FOREVER. And it doesn’t matter who you are, you could be the President of the United States, the literal Commander in Chief and the second you say no to them, the red eye of Sauron descends, and the spineless corporate media follows it’s lead. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The President has displayed a severe decline in his mental ability, one that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The President is clearly not well, throughout President Trump’s first and second term of office, President Trump has tested the restraints of the U.S. Presidency, and it has always been a question of how connected to reality the President is. Does he believe his own lies and fabrications? Tales of millions of illegals voting against him in election, allegations of massive conspiracies against him, or are they all made up for political expediency.</p>
<p>Time and time again, aids and underlings, from the cabinet level like John Bolton, to senior military officials like Mark Milley, have described the President as at times unhinged, or in a serious state of mental decline. They have reported to be fearful of leaving the President alone, for at any moment he could suddenly decide to go to war with another Nuclear Power, from his book <i> The Oaths We Take</i> Milley displays the Presidents horrific demands to shoot unarmed protesters, assassinate foreign journalists and bomb a laundry list of countries seemingly with little rhyme or reason “At any moment the commander in chief could go rogue and end the world”. </p>
<p>But this was all behind the scenes, the President has not been as available of recent, giving few interviews and press conferences, even his signature rallies have been drastically reduced. And one cannot miss the lapses of memory, he walks and moves noticeably slower and when he does speak it is often verging on total incoherence, a trait which was on visible display at the <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">speech on Memorial Day</span> where the President unprompted spoke about windmills, comedian Amy Schumer and Japan’s dead Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
<p>When he does rally, his rants are rambling, bordering on insane, forgetting the names of prominent close officials, world leaders, family members, and even his own wife. This has all been detailed in video after video, but when put to the White House, officials claim this is all nonsense and demand we not believe our lying eyes and ears “The President is the same man Americans overwhelmingly elected and re-elected, in fact he is better than ever” said Alyssa Farah the White House Press Secretary. </p>
<p>Questions over the Presidents mental fitness are uncomfortable, and many Democrats and reporters do not wish to investigate them, especially as they look forward to the 2024 election where President Trump will not be on the ballot, but this issue is far too important to brush off, the country needs a strong and stable executive, Mr. Trump is no longer fit to be President and as long as he remains so, the world is in great peril.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania sat 14 rows back in Westminster Abbey amid Queen Elizabeth's funeral</p>
<p>A quirk of royal protocol means that US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were sat far at the back of Westminster Abbey at the Queens funeral yesterday, showing pictures that placed the President of the United States rows behind other world leaders, such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who as leaders of commonwealth nations are given precedence.</p>
<p>This fact and the many images taken of the President, one of over 2000 guests at the abbey, has become a meme online and has made the rounds on many of the American Late Night talks shows that frequently mock the President, for instance being seated behind the late Queens Corgis, or the Presidents demand that he be allowed to enter the venue by helicopter and not via bus as almost every other dignitary did and some daytime TV hosts derided the Presidents seating as “The nose-bleed section”</p>
<p>The President lashed out at the criticism over Twitter, where he claimed in typical all caps that the United States was given ‘GREAT LOCATION’ and said that rumors of his anger are a ‘TOTAL LIES’. The President remained focused on the criticism of his seating upon a return to the States, where he told a press pack that it was “A beautiful occasion, really beautiful, and despite your reporting we had great seats.” And when asked he said that despite previous historical precedent he intends to return for King Charles III Coronation, the first American President to do so.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">After Congress failed to legislate the end of the labor dispute, the President is preparing more direct solutions. </p>
<p>Why is is the country so worried about a rail strike? Well for months, Democrats and Republicans have been arguing over a labor dispute between railroad executives and their workers, with large disagreement over how to end the impasse. Over 100,000 freight rail workers have been demanding greater benefits in their contracts and if they aren’t heeded to, are threatening to strike, a move that some <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: #C00000;">economists claim</span> could put the nation into recession.</p>
<p>But Senate democrats have recently refused to pass a Republican agreement that would force the rail worker union to accept the deal, holding up a Senate filibuster. Claiming that the bill would impose a poor deal on the workers. “It would be fundamentally undemocratic to force American workers to accept a bad deal” said Senator Schumer of New York “and we encourage a new deal to be worked out before our Republican colleagues and the President, force a strike” .</p>
<p>Republicans and the President have similarly blamed Democrats for caving to their progressive members demands “The position these radical democrats have, is going to fundamentally hurt Americans, this is a political stunt that will create tens of thousands of job losses” said Senator Josh Lummis of Wyoming.</p>
<p>As the deadline for the strike comes forward, it appears that President Trump is preparing drastic action to place the military into domestic freight train operation and end the strike, a move that <span style=" text-decoration: underline; color: #C00000;">legal scholars and union negotiators</span> are calling illegal and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>“I won’t allow these people to trash our economy, not while I’m President, if these Democrats won’t make a deal I have the complete power to do that, because frankly they’ve gone too far. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The repeal of Obamacare has finally gone into effect in many states, and without a replacement millions face losing their coverage, </p>
<p>Amy Gibbs had finally gotten her high blood pressure under control with a combination of three medications, but after her insurance expired in December amid a nationwide coverage loss, she had to cut down, sparking fears with Amy and many others like her that their health was at serious risk. </p>
<p>In need of a way to pay for the extra expense, she created an account on OnlyFans – a social media platform where users sell original content (often lude or pornographic in nature) to monthly subscribers, opting to post photos of herself either nude or in lingerie. </p>
<p>The plan worked and Ms Gibbs, found herself making upwards of $50,000 dollars enough to pay for her medical expenses and help others as well with their own healthcare “It’s more money that I ever made in any job” said the 23 year old former waitress. “It’s more than I know what to do with”.</p>
<p>A community has grown on the platform of just such women, who turned to OnlyFans, a service founded in Britain in 2016 which boomed in the pandemic, and now caters to 100+ million users. With hundreds of thousands of women facing the loss of their healthcare, and jobs as the pandemic took a devastating toll on female heavy industries like the retail business, restaurants and yes healthcare roles women like Lauren Eisenburger have turned to the platform initially to make a small windfall, only to turn the site into their primary income. </p>
<p>“It’s a tough market for sure, not everyone can do it, but there is easy money to be made” said M. Eisenburger, who stopped short of endorsing other people follow in her footsteps “A lot of people are in a tough situation now, so I don’t want to say this is the best option, but it is an option.” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #747474; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Taylor Swift has not made any indication that she is running for office, but perhaps this feud shows she should.</p>
<p>Throughout her career and even now off the back of her ultra-massive world tour, Taylor Swift has barely dipper her toe into politics. Until last week Swift has not made her stance on most political issues clear. Beside her endorsement of Democrats since 2018, one struggles to recall any hint that she would ever consider a life in politics in any capacity, why would she? When her life in music is going extremely well, and she is on the verge of becoming a billionaire next year, bother entering the minefield of national politics. So why is the President of the United States picking a fight with her?</p>
<p>Is it his ego? That seeing this young, successful woman dominating the media cycle, while he an aging, rotting pumpkin is fading away as Americans are more and more looking forward to the day, he disappears entirely from the public view. Probably, but there is also the fear that she may become a political rival. The President started this war supposedly after her team has rejected a White House invitation to receive a Medal of Freedom, probably igniting the fury of the President who takes any slight as a personal attack. </p>
<p>Taylor’s retort a full throated denunciation of the President, his policies and his administration dismal record on human rights to the roaring approval of her fans, sparked online fascination over the slight possibility of a Presidential run and in a recent poll 18% of Democrats unprompted said they preferred Swift as their parties nominee, without any hint that she has expressed any intention to run. The idea seems ridiculous on it’s face, but is it, the President doesn’t think so, remarking to the press that he ‘wished (he) could run against her’ but thankfully the constitution does not allow it.</p>
<p>But the war between MAGA and Swifties has escalated, as the myriad of Republicans and Democrats vying to succeed Trump are desperately jostling on the sidelines, the cringiest moment going to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who officially included Swifts music as an example of 'harmful woke culture' on the debate stage. </p>
<p>But perhaps what we need to defeat whatever MAGA, Trump Clone Republican wins the nomination is not another Democratic politician, but someone who can clearly play to what American’s want, a celebrity. Most experts and pundits dismissed the idea of hand, but perhaps they were too quick.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The National Address Was the Presidents most Nakedly Authoritarian and Antidemocratic of His Presidency </p>
<p>In perhaps one of the most shocking and awful acts of Donald Trump’s Presidency, his reaction to Republicans poor Midterm performance is one of the worst. In a desperate attempt to feverishly blame something else other than the backlash to his poor tenure these last two years. The President has adopted widely debunked election fraud theories.</p>
<p>Dominion Voting Systems, a voting software company used in any states has come under attack by President Trump, his supporters and other Republicans for supposedly deleting votes for Republicans or switching them to Democrats. "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," in a joint statement by over 20 mostly democratic State Attorneys General “This election was the most secure in American history”</p>
<p>Describing the election as ‘one of the greatest frauds in history’ the White House released the order which directs the Director of Homeland Security Gene Hamilton to seize voting machines in Arizona, Georgia , Wisconsin, North Carolina and Alaska, to search for supposed evidence relating to election fraud and now footage appears to show, DHS officers carrying out the order in Maricopa county, AZ, defying an order by the current Secretary of State and Governor-elect Katie Hobbs, for all machines to be left alone. </p>
<p>What exactly happens if any of this ‘massive evidence’ is uncovered is totally unknown. But what is known, is that  this order is absolutely illegal. In a makeshift press conference on his way to Marine One Trump himself couldn’t specify what would happen, only referencing nonspecific lawsuits to overturn the election results, though no major challenges have been filed by any candidate yet, except Kari Lake in Arizona. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Trump’s Consistent Appeasement of Putin Enabled Him To Start This War </p>
<p>President Putin’s brutal and monstrous invasion of Ukraine has changed everything. It’s butchery has saturated the news coverage for anyone with a screen in front of them, but we mustn’t ignore what is perhaps the most abhorrent part of the story. The President of the United States is on the side of the butcher. </p>
<p>Though his official statement has like almost all other not Russia aligned autocratic world leaders, condemned the attack as a ‘disgusting modern day holocaust’ and the President has at points made aggressive statements toward Russia, one cannot get past his non-official remarks to a press huddle immediately after the attack. The ones where he again praised President Putin as a ‘really Smart and tough leader’ and primarily blamed European leaders for the invasion ‘This is much more a problem for Europe’. And even in his criticism, Trump couched it in slavenly praise for Putin, describing  the invasion on Ukraine not as an atrocity but instead as harmful to President Putin’s reputation. </p>
<p>Trump’s appeasement and praise of Putin has gone back years, since he first launched his Presidential bid, and for years he has acted more in Russia’s interests than America’s, attempting to deny funds to Ukraine in exchange for political favors, his years long distain of NATO, which has brought it to the point of near collapse, and the President’s distain for the rules based order has all emboldened Putin’s long game. </p>
<p>And most damming of all the leaked Pentagon reports that indicate that for months, the Department of Defense understood the threat that Putin’s buildup of forces meant at the Ukrainian border, and the administrations efforts to suppress these cables. When French President Macron came forward with his intelligence communities concerns, the President dismissed them, and he refused to comment about joint military exercises in neighboring Belarus telling the press nothing beyond “we’re watching”.</p>
<p>Whatever the Presidents though process, something that is admittedly difficult to decipher it’s time to question what role the President played in reducing the United States, Ukraine’s and the worlds preparedness for this invasion?</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">In long-anticipated move, today President Trump made the decision to fire his leading intelligence chiefs</p>
<p>Trump announced the firing via Twitter, announcing that Kash Patel and William Evanina the two department’s deputies would be stepping up in an acting capacity to the CIA and FBI respectively. The relationship between President Trump and his intelligence officials Gina Haspel and Christopher Wray has been strained for months since his re-election, stemming from the two’s refusal to support his hardline domestic policing policies and instances of insubordination such as refusing to investigate electoral fraud in the 2020 election, and the agencies poor response to the BLM riots last year.</p>
<p>During President Trumps tenure, the intelligence agencies have become a base for many Never Trumper’s who took up positions there and continue to resist the president’s positions, such as drawing down U.S. troops from abroad, declaring ANTIFA a terrorist organization, investigating former FBI chief Comey over leaking classified information and demanding America’s allies to pay more for our support. Additionally, Haspel and Wray were longtime careerists and lobbyists before entering government, who have not distinguished themselves to the President as sufficiently supportive.</p>
<p>For months Republican officials and the President have show their dissatisfaction of the intelligence officials, Senators Cornyn, Thune and Scott all came out in support of the Presidents decision “The directors have clearly been misleading the President and the American people, we need new people to right this ship” said Scott, each of men in the running to succeed Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who has not commented on the firings.</p>
<p>These changes accompany other big changes that have been made at the Pentagon, to remove previously unreliable establishment figures who did not support his ‘America First’ Agenda. Trump said these changes were necessary as “These people were real wreckers, wrecking everything, I wanted something done soon, they wouldn’t do it, wait months and months, these people were screwing us, so they had to go”.</p>

<p><strong>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST:</strong> Tonight, on ALL IN. The crisis on American campuses continues. Protests and unrest amidst the Israeli bombardment of Gaza while our thuggish and tinpot dictator of a President turns our country’s military against its own citizens.</p>
<p>Good evening I’m Chris Hayes live from New York, a city that is under attack right now, not from a foreign threat, no. But from it’s own President. Disturbing and horrific imagery has emerged today after Donald Trump, the President of the United States, made the decision to federalize and deploy the New York National Guard, against anti-genocide protesters on Columbia University campus, while threatening many other college campuses across the country including UCLA, University of Texas, University of South Florida and many others.</p>
<p>The videos of these mobs of black clad soldiers, some armed with rifles, pistols and grenades. The kind of military gear one would expect on a battlefield not so much a college campus. President Trump’s monstrous assertion that these protests were in some way ‘terror camps’ led to what could only be described as a bloody crackdown by the government. Rubber bullets, tear gas, police horses and worse have been deployed against peaceful protesters, students, faculty and teachers. It has been indiscriminate, brutal and deadly. Republican lawmakers, the President’s cabinet including Secretary of Defense Tom Cotton have been baying for blood for weeks. “Send the Marines” reads an open letter by the House Minority leader, truly frightening stuff </p>
<p>Tonight, I have New York Mayor Eric Adams, Mr. Adams thank you for being here, what do you have to say about these troops being deployed in your city, as I understand without you being asked, without Governor Cuomo being asked, with more troops possible being deployed across the country if quote “the terrorism on college campuses doesn’t end” </p>
<p><strong>ERIC ADAMS, N.Y. MAYOR:</strong> This was a disgusting move Chris, truly disgusting, these are New Yorkers not terrorists. Ordinary people, and ordinary Jewish New Yorkers know this very well. Ordering soldiers to shoot at unarmed children, peaceably assembling, chanting, showing their solidarity for the ordinary Palestinians, not for HAMAS. And let me push back on this chant anger, “From the River to the Sea” is not a terrorist chant, it’s a display of solidarity and humanity. So the President in my opinion has illegally invaded New York tonight and all Americans should be outraged. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The comments came a disastrous press conference following the chaotic withdrawal of American forces</p>
<p>President Trump has accepted no blame for the chaos that has unfolded in Afghanistan for the past few months, as American forces exited the country, a goal long sought by the administration. But one that has been mired in disaster and death as the Taliban swept across the country and a dozen American marines were killed in a terrorist attack in Kabul, in scenes deeply reminiscent of the fall of Saigon in 1975.</p>
<p>But in a press conference President Trump, fiercely defended the administration’s decision to withdraw from the country, in a testy and sparring exchange with reporters. First dismissing suggestions that the withdrawal was ‘botched’. “This was a deal, we had to get out, these wars we don’t want them, we were wasting so much money and blood in Afghanistan”. And then argued with reporters that claimed he had been briefed by senior military officials not to withdraw “That’s not true, totally false, no-one said that, at all, everyone wanted to get out” Though senior Commander General McKenzie has claimed otherwise, and former head of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley has claimed on numerous occasions that he told President Trump the same. </p>
<p>When the President was asked if there was anyone to blame for the collapse of the country, the President denied any personal responsibility and curiously even refused to blame the Taliban for their role in the collapse. “These were very fierce warriors, smart people, believe me we would be fighting them a very long time and the Afghan’s who were were giving everything to, wasting lots of our dollars on, were total cowards, threw down their weapons so fast you wouldn't believe, their President Ghani ran away like a total dog. So if you will ask where blame is, I think the blame goes everywhere, way back on Obama and Bush.” </p>
<p>The President again praised the Taliban later, referring to the group as people the United States could “work with, perhaps far better than before, I think actually this will be a really great thing for our country” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Liberals made historic errors with their Justice’s and now Conservatives must not make the same.</p>
<p>Let’s not lose focus here. Left-wing Lawmakers and the liberal pundit class are looking ahead to the 2024 election as a pivotal opportunity to reshape the United States Supreme Court. Eyeing the possibility that they may get to make multiple appointments and are openly threatening to make an authoritarian power-grab in expanding the court. That is why regardless of who win’s the Presidential election in November, the two eldest conservative Justices should retire now, or risk an extremist-Democrat filling their seats.</p>
<p>Republicans right now have a narrow grasp of the Senate, thanks the Vice-President Pence’s tie-breaking vote. But for years Democrats have feverishly worked to put their thumbs on the scale in Senate elections across the country with polling suggesting that if Republicans were to lose the Senate next year, they may not win it back until the 2030’s when both Justice’s would be well into their 80’s.</p>
<p>Republican efforts to convince the Justice’s to take a well-deserved permanent vacation have ramped up, unfortunately at the same time as Democrats commenced a vicious smear campaign against these titans of the legal system, where self-styled “independent investigative journalists” lob patently ridiculous charges of corruption. They believe that in attacking these men for how they spend their leisure time with their family's, how they speak politely and openly in party settings, and how close they are with their wives, are grounds for impeachment, when really the charges are so flimsy I am of the opinion that it is a complete bait and switch. To convince these studious men that the best way to defend themselves and their honor is to not bend to the unfounded criticism and to remain on the court.</p>
<p>The mudslinging at the highest legal scholars in the land hasn’t been helped by President Trump’s rather blunt request that he would like to see the two men step aside so he could get what he described as a “Full Trump court … wow imagine what we could do with that?”. Prompting his allies to parade garish RESIGN signs outside the Justice’s houses, those words were not helpful to say the least and again I believe play into the Democrats effort to play of these great men's pride.</p>
<p>The difference between a 6-3 and a 5-4 Supreme Court is enormous, and it would tarnish both these men’s awesome legacies if they were to make the same mistake as Justice Ginsburg not to mention be one of the biggest political blunders in history to throw away what conservatives have fought tooth and nail for for decades.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The Internets Favorite Self Described Misogynist Was Greeted Favorably by American Conservatives</p>
<p>Andrew Tate took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Phoenix, with an invitation for the American right to join the 'manosphere', and kind words for President Trump. A man who openly advocates for male supremacy and celebrates violence against women, who has been banned from Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, received a standing ovation at the influential gathering, a bookend to President Trump’s closing address at the gathering.</p>
<p>His prominent role in the jamboree, despite his many, many, many disgusting moments including that “females belong in the Kitchen” rape victims “bare responsibility” for their attacks and encouraged stabbing punching and choking women who “step out of line”. It all represented a truly disgusting mask-off moment for the CPAC acolytes who see Tates success despite his criticism as an idealized model for an empowered, oppressive and enforced patriarchy. </p>
<p>Tate tried his best to keep his speech somewhat in the mainstream, a bland motivational speech praising masculinity, discipline and sacrifice and duty, “The west is crumbling, and we have to decide whether we are men of action, who get things done, who build skyscrapers, who climb mountains, men who sacrifice and build the world for women and children to live in.” </p>
<p>And as was required by all CPAC members he made his loyalties to Trump clear “The matrix, wants Trump dead, A man who has done more for western society than any other, and I say fight on”. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Trump and Tate have embraced so openly, both exploit the base impulses of controversy and extremism, both even peddle hokum university classes, and the rise of Trump and Tate make up has prompted fears that our society will soon be undistinguishable from the brutally misogynistic vision of the future from of Margret Attwood's The Handmaids Tail, Roe is out, next it could be birth control pills, the department of education, no-fault divorce, the return of adultery laws or underage marriage. Perhaps we shouldn’t even cover this clown show, and attempt to starve it of attention it desperately seeks, surely it couldn’t harm us?</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">A moment of unparalleled danger, driven by rogue nuclear powers, including the United States</p>
<p>Dark trends are pointing the world in one direction, toward the point of global nuclear holocaust. The war in Ukraine has prompted leaders of global powers to engage in the most unholy kind of nuclear escalation. China, Russia and the United States are spending eye watering amounts on modernizing, upgrading and building up their nuclear arsenals, and in a 30 year break of the shared disarmament policy, the United States has recommenced the full scale testing of nuclear devices, breaking the 30 year old Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p>“This is a clear invitation for other nuclear-armed countries to follow suit” said director of the arms control association Daryl Kimball, his words prophetic as North Korea, Russia, China and now France have all announced that new nuclear tests will be carried out, combined with the US Presidents new “Massive Retaliation” policy which has commissioned that the United States double it’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, and deploy sea-launched nuclear missiles, the kinds of weapons axed by the George H.W. Bush Administration, as well as tasking the United States Space Force to explore it’s own nuclear capacity, threatening to demolish the 1967 Outer Space Treaty in the process of this dangerous era of nuclear weaponry.</p>
<p>President Trump himself has dismissed even the notion of arms control and has actively pushed for a new Nuclear Arms race which he believes the United States will win "and win easily", jettisoning the world back to the darkest days of the cold war. He has pushed for the United States allies, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Ukraine all to develop and expand their nuclear programs as a deterrent, this alone merited the Doomsday clock being set to 30 seconds to midnight the closer it has ever been to 0, not taking into account Climate Change, the uncertain dangers of AI, or biological threats.</p>
<p>Can the Clock be rewound? Everyone on Earth has an interest in reducing the likelihood of global catastrophe, and it is the task of leaders to display common sense and a shared desire for action and serious dialogue between the global powers, to confront the apex predator threat this planet is facing. And until that is done the clock shall remain at 30 Seconds to midnight.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Celebrating her election win on Tuesday night, Stephanie Clifford didn’t give away that it was an upset.</p>
<p>The results of the 2022 midterm elections were predictable and very much went as predicted, minority leader Jeffries will take the gavel in January as the Speaker of the House, Democrats captured the Senate Majority, disposing of a cadre of Trump acolyte’s, and Republicans managed to string together a threadbare victory by keeping their big ticket Governors Mansions. All of which was more or less the electoral forecast before the election, the 6 year itch came with a nasty bite.</p>
<p>But the surprises of the night, lay on the fringes, the fifth Texas district, where a woman with massive name recognition, and little political experience won herself a seat in the 117th United States Congress, Stephanie Clifford much better known as Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Born in Baton Rouge to divorced Parents the 43 Year old Daniels has taken the most unusual route to Congress, sex scandals normally the death of a career in politics became her origin story, with a fairly simple pitch to her voters , not just the obvious and successful effort to nationalize the race and make it a referendum on Trump “Vote for me, and screw the President” but with well marketed campaign on Ms. Clifford herself as a working class, success story. “I am part of the American dream” goes one of her ads, “Working six nights a week, most of them double shifts” the Trump affair is never mentioned explicitly instead it is implied. Many of her supporters initially drawn by the gimmick of electing a Presidential mistress, found themselves genuine fans of her politics, a willingness to attack the blatant hypocrisy of her Republican ‘Ivy league’ opposition who is more willing to take dirty money than stripper according to the leaflets.</p>
<p>“I ran because I thought it was the best way to push back against this narrative, to show that people like me, independent working women, should be represented in government, that not just lawyers, bankers and con artists can be in Congress”. At her victory party, a stunning 10 point reversal for the district than 2 years ago Trump won the affair again wasn’t mentioned, “This was a campaign for hope, not cynics, I’m not backing down, thank you”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">“I’m not aware of any U.S. forces on the ground,” a Pentagon spokesperson said, directly contradicting the White House.</p>
<p>Following President Trump’s ordering of airstrikes targeting drug cartels in Mexico, the Pentagon has refused to answer the question of if ground forces have also been deployed into the country without the consent of the Mexican government. However, the White House has broken this veil of silence in a report to congress which says. “A small number of United States military personnel are deployed in Mexico to assist in the military operation against transnational-narcotraffickers (Drug cartels), in a delayed War Powers Act report. </p>
<p>This month, the U.S. began a declared campaign against the Cartels, for their involvement in perpetuating the fentanyl crisis, which the United States government labeled a “weaponized synthetic poison”, beginning with a strike on supposed cartel infrastructure in northern Mexico, however until now the Pentagon has not been clear about the potential presence of boots on the ground. When the Pentagon Press Secretary was asked on the 17th he responded, “I’m not aware of any U.S. forces on the ground.” And the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. And several members of the Pentagon including Lt Col Garry McSweeney told the intercept that that response remained accurate. </p>
<p>The U.S. strikes in Mexico have greatly damaged relations between the United States and Mexico, who’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called the attack “Irresponsible, dangerous, and the gravest offense to the people and the sovereignty of Mexico”, threatening to take diplomatic action against the United States and shutting down further cooperation between Mexican authorities and the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>The admission that United States forces may be present in Mexico, could widen the rift between the countries and further heighten tensions, though officials on both sides of the border have strenuously denied that a state of war could break out between the countries. Additionally the United States has quietly assigned a name to it’s operation against Cartels in Mexico indicating that the operation could be long term in nature, calling it </strong>Spring Hickory</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Trump Endorsement Played A Key Role In Sealing the Fate of Brazilian Democracy</p>
<p>Brazil has descended into a nightmare of political upheaval, quasi military rule and state violence, since the nations democratic elections were upended by the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro, who intervened in the democratic process to close polling stations early in places where his opposition former President Lula de Silva was leading, and shortly after, he baselessly declared victory before all the votes could be counted. </p>
<p>Supported by the Military, Bolsonaro has imprisoned many who protested the moves, including members of the political opposition and a supreme court justice he has also spread rampant disinformation about a supposed opposition led plot to rig the election, as the basis for his own declaration. It couldn’t be described any other way than a self-coup, one aided and abetted by the United States and President Donald Trump, who has agreed with Bolsanaro the “Trump of the Tropics” without evidence of the opposition plot and congratulated him for ‘winning’ the Presidency. </p>
<p>Leading Brazilian Generals like General Paulo Nogueira had not yet publicly commented on the election, until President Trump issued his personal congratulations, only then did he assert his support for Bolsonaro's interpretation of electoral law, a decision that was then followed by subordinates and colleagues within the Brazilian military. Members of the Trump administration were reportedly in contact with the Brazilian President for weeks leading up to the election, and the Los Angeles times has revealed that Secretary of State Pompeo steered U.S. election monitoring teams to issue a report, that supported the Bolsonaro governments claims, of an opposition campaign of fraud. </p>
<p>This marks a dark day, a return to the cold war, bad neighbor politics of the United States. The super power who rigged elections, supported military coups, and assassinated Latin American politicians at will. “America applauds the Brazilian people support for a wonderful man and great friend” said Trump, while Democrats in congress accuse the President of burying Brazilian Democracy “This is an American orchestrated violent takeover” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, “This shows the United States is no longer an ally of democracy” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">What has the House select committee investigating the Jan 6. protest purported to have found? </p>
<p>The House select committee investigating the January 6 protests, claims to have laid out a case that allies of, and supposedly Hillary Clinton herself were involved in a concerted effort to overturn the 2020 election, which led to violent scenes at the US Capitol, documenting actions and records that is intended to lay the legal framework for criminal investigators.</p>
<p>The January 6 protests according to the report lays the blame directly at the feet of Clinton, who is accused of launching a months-long effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, describing how Clinton tried to pressure legislators, judges, and eventually her own supporters to help her overturn her defeat. The summary describes how the words of Mrs Clinton directly led to the January 6 protests which ended in violence when the D.C. National Guard perceived an impending attack on the capital and discharged firearms, resulting in the deaths of 8 protesters. </p>
<p>The report absolves the National Guard of any perceived wrongdoing and takes to task the accusations of Democrats that it was the President who acted illegally and over the heads of his national security team and Mayor Bowser to order the Guard to dispel the protests by force. </p>
<p>The committee’s conclusion has already been praised by President Trump who has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of trying to steal the 2020 election and pushed the Justice Department to pursue indictment against Mrs. Clinton and her allies for the events of January 6th. However Democrats have pushed back on these charges as wholly politically motivated, “The events of that dark day would not have happened without the President's orders to attack peaceful protesters” reads a statement by the House Minority leadership, “The weaponization of the independent justice system against the President's political enemies is abhorrent, and we are pledging to conduct a thorough and unbiased investigation into the events of the January 6 massacre if Democrats retake the majority in November” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Results show that progressive and left-wing challengers are on a heading to defeat moderate incumbents </p>
<p>An Axios analysis shows that moderate candidates are losing in congressional primaries this year when challenged against progressive candidates in winnable Democratic seats at a rate of 3:1. This could make life harder for Democrats in a midterm year where they have the headwinds behind them and are hoping to regain one and possible both houses of Congress. </p>
<p><strong>Zoom Out:</strong> Left-wing and progressive groups have made a concerted effort to unseat members of the Democratic center, fielding candidates, heavily fundraising and organizing heavily on the basis that these Democrats have so far offered tepid opposition to the Trump administration, especially as Democrats gave in and passed stimulus spending and election-security bills last month after Republicans threatened to eliminate the filibuster to get them passed. </p>
<p>The signing of these controversial pieces of legislation, has placed many moderate Democratic legislators in direct opposition to the party’s progressive wing, who have labeled the End Inflation Act a giveaway for the rich and the Safer Elections Act an effort to disenfranchise minority groups.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom In:</strong> Across the country these progressives are winning primaries and many other moderate Democrats are facing tough challenges. Jumaane Williams defeated Governor Cuomo in New York in a stunning upset, John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, Morgan Harper and Mandela Barnes for the Ohio and Wisconsin Senate Seats have all edged out moderate aligned candidates. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture:</strong> To head off these primary challenges, many Democrats have adopted harsher rhetoric specifically around the 2020 election, specifically questioning the final result. Both Senators Michael Bennet and Kamala Harris who are facing down challengers, have sponsored a bill to ‘investigate the results’ “I fully intend to get to the truth in the 2020 election” said Bennet to a crowd, “It is the patriotic duty of Americans to question those results, not just trust the flawed White House narrative.”</p>
<p>‘Election Questioners’ have surged ahead in independent polling suggesting that the Democratic party base has embraced the theory that President Trump in some way ‘stole’ the 2020 election from Hillary Clinton, using the issue to fundraise, file lawsuits and launch ‘independent investigations’ of the result, several like Nina Turner have even used their appearance at the fatal January 6 Protests as marketing for other primary's, claiming in ads, that the President “stole the election” and “slaughtered those that question it.” And a new super PAC <i>Correct the Record</i>, has emerged to fund candidates that support said claims.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">On our isolated commune, we kids were taught that the world was about to end..</p>
<p><strong>“Where are you from?” </strong>For many this is a casual question but for me, it is an extremely loaded one. The real answer is that I grew up on compounds across the country, traveling in small caravans from one location to the next, my reality was composed entirely of, daily readings, prescription drugs, fast food, and flags, but that is too wordy do I often say New York. <p>
<p>Let me elaborate. I was raised to believe, that there would be a second coming for years, it was an insular existence, our whole world revolved around following His footsteps, never reading outside the prescribed books, or watching television or movies, my whole world was composed of people who believed the same thing and to me it was incredibly mundane.</p>
<p>Even the mystical element was extremely ordinary. His hats and His words were all expected and mundane parts of our worlds. We would recite the texts, even if they made no sense to me it was simply expected. We like other groups had our own regalia, supposedly first edition, though it is unlikely that they actually were. We were discouraged from asking questions, it wasn’t disallowed but was discouraged, I remember that once an older kid asked, “What was in Kim’s letters?” The answer came back that it was a mystery, and after that, he had to clean out ashtrays for weeks.</p>
<p>When we got to the big compound in Lyman, there were lots of people, and for a short time, everything seemed perfect for a while, hundreds eating together, and swapping stories about the road, about the second coming, how we were all certain it would be here soon, and all the unbelievers the sad and loser-like would be left behind. </p>
<p>It would only be a few weeks before we were told that a new prophecy had dropped, and we would be expected for what would be our final rally…</p>
<p><i>“Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God. ”</i><br />

e.pages.push(`<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Disney Fanatic</span><span style="font-size: 20px;"> | Where's Michelle?</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Imagineers Speculate on What Became of an Animatronic Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton was widely predicted to be on the path to the Presidency. However as we all know things did not turn out that way, and instead Donald J Trump was elected the 45th President, the surprise caught many off guard including the animatronic department at <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom</span> who were already hard at work creating a Hillary Clinton animatronic to add to the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Hall of Presidents</span>. According to an anonymous imagineer, it has been confirmed that rather than build a new one, the Hillary animatronic was hastily repurposed into a Trump figure.<p>
<p>By 2020, you would think Disney would not risk making the same mistake twice, according to podcaster Steve Zhust. “It takes a lot of time and effort to build these animatronics, months in some cases, they backed the wrong horse in 2016, and from what I hear the design team caught a lot of flack for not thinking ahead”. However as circumstances slowly began to shift an order came from the higher-ups to get to work on animatronic for Michelle Obama. “After the Democratic Convention, it was just sort of assumed that Michelle would win, she had that massive lead, apparently about a dozen newspapers had already fully printed their Michelle-Wins pieces before the presses had to be stopped, was it Germany or Italy where they actually reported her winning? It doesn't matter, but over at Magic Kingdom this team who were expecting to get a bit of a PR Buzz by wheeling her out the next day woke up thinking ‘we’re fucked’. </p>
<p>The papers, the polls, the experts, and all conventional wisdom had been disproven again, by Trump's shocking 2020 upset victory, and now Disney had an expensive Michelle Obama animatronic lying around, the question is, where is it now? Zhust says he has spoken with several Imagineers, who wish to remain anonymous and gave differing accounts. </p>
<p>The prevailing theory is that the piece was stripped down, the skin probably destroyed or placed in a bin to be used at a later date, and the skeletal core and face structure were put under storage, locked away in the Disney Archive. Another said that rather than take it to pieces, the animatronic was left intact, for the possible anticipation that a First Ladies exhibition might one day be opened (an idea that must vex the Hillary exoskeleton trapped inside the Trump skin sack), one said the machine was dismantled by contractors and melted down in the dead of the night, to prevent any leaked images of Disney’s second election whoopsie. But one Imagineer claims, that rather than simply dismantle the droid, or place it in cold storage, the costly piece was instead reclothed, given a haircut, and placed inside the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge Oga's Cantina</span>, repurposed as<i> Vayla Gideon</i> a bounty hunter who some <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">online</span> have noted bares some resemblance to the former Democratic nominee.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The four astronauts, the first to make the journey from Earth to the Moon in 50 years met President Trump</p>
<p>The four crewmen and women of Artemis 3 were hosted this Thursday at the White House, to meet with President Trump and the First Lady, in a meeting where he showed off a moon rock that the crew had brought back, which is now on display on his desk in the Oval Office. The President also praised the astronauts for doing a “top-notch job” and said that the “whole country was really proud of what you fabulous people did up there”. </p>
<p>The success of the lunar crew and the NASA Artemis mission has been widely celebrated by the administration as a major achievement, with the President himself praising the Moon landing as a capstone on his effort to Make America Great Again. Already recounting the phone call he had with the lunar crew from the White House at his extended 'Thank you tour', Vice President Pence, who was on the board of the administration's lunar policy, has praised the President's steadfastness “If it wasn’t for this man's unrelenting drive and vision for our country's lunar and space program, we wouldn’t have had these inspiring pictures we see today.” </p>
<p>The Artemis program once derided as another Trumpian scheme, and purely a piece of political theatre for the Trump administration has in many ways stunned critics with its success, as Congress heaped funding onto the program, as fears of a renewed space race with China have emerged, and Artemis may very well pave the way for a Mars mission within the next 4 years</p>
<p>“We brought the glamour back to the Space program,” the President said, claiming that many people doubted that the United States would be capable of the Lunar landing, “Boy we proved them wrong, didn’t we, they must feel pretty stupid now.” While meeting the Astronauts the President also commented on the state of the 2024 election, again refusing to endorse any of the Republican candidates saying he was “Looking forward to the convention, it’s going to be a doozy!” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The Party Claims It Will Not Spoil Elections, But Make No Mistake It Will</p>
<p> Let's not mince words, the new Forward Party announced by failed Presidential nominee Andrew Yang is a direct threat to American democracy, it will crash and burn as all third parties do, but not before taking down the grand American experiment with it. The odds that it will accomplish any of its goals, to de-polarize the United States are so minute that they are non-existent, the party is another flash in the pan pipedream, a vanity project of an ego-maniac who has no concern for the future of the country or the party he led to a disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>The party claims to comprise a moderate, common-sense majority. It doesn’t, it exists only as yet another grift. This time from a man who successfully swindled enough Democrats to win the nomination only to receive the reckoning they did in 2020. And so in response, Yang took his ball and went home, breaking with the Democrats and building his Forward Party which has now unveiled a slate of independent candidates and endorsements to the applause of Yang’s hapless die-hards who allege without evidence that the Democratic Party was actually behind his electoral flop and not his own delusional and self-sabotaging campaign.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is the only real chance our country has going forward, and these Forward candidates are simply spoilers, even in uncompetitive races, they do nothing but serve the MAGA narrative that the two parties are just as extreme as each other, just when Never-Trump Republicans should be joining the party in the popular front, senior Democrats are envisioning, here comes the Forward Party to offer them the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and stop them joining a bulwark against fascism the country desperately needs, with blasé promises of 'abandoning the prison of left-right political spectrum'.</p>
<p>The Forward Party is yet another addition to the slate of extremist and quixotic third parties the United States has sported. Like George Wallace’s American Independent Party, which sold the South into the hands of Richard Nixon and a straight line can be drawn from Ralph Nader’s Presidential aspirations and the Iraq War, and surely Yang himself learned the lessons of 2020, of just what multi-millionaires peddling phony centrism can do for our body politic. Or perhaps he did, just all the wrong ones. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The United States Secretary of Defense said that the Cuban government was responsible for terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>BOLTON:</strong> Good afternoon everyone, as several of you know we just gotten back from a lovely trip to Europe and I’m glad to be with you today. Let’s get started shall we.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTER1:</strong> Good afternoon Mr. Secretary. First, glad to have you back, and second is there anything to the reporting about a cyber security attack, purported to have been conducted by the Cuban government? </p>
<p><strong>BOLTON:</strong> Thank you, well we’re glad to be back, and yes we do have solid evidence—senior-level reporting that these cyber attacks have been conducted on the United States, these reports have been increasing for the last few years now, but it’s not just cyber security, there are reports of other serious threats, including what we are confident are definite attacks on American soldiers, both in Cuba and elsewhere. Who have all been afflicted with what we are describing as ultra-sonic weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTER2:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Secretary, I hope it was a good trip. Is there anything to the reports that the United States is involved, or in any way aiding these protest groups in Cuba, in line with the allegations made by the Cuban government, and the President's tweet?</p>
<p><strong>BOLTON:</strong> Thank you, it was indeed a very nice trip lots of great views, but no, we are not facilitating any of this, these are simply the expressions of the Cuban people, the President and this administration is simply vocalizing his support for the rights and needs of these protesters, and I think it would be very disrespectful to rob these brave people of agency.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTER3:</strong> Yes, again welcome back we’re very glad to see you here in the briefing room, does the United States support a regime change in Cuba? Because we’ve seen allegations in the Times that there have been discussions—senior level discussions about specifically and I quote “We want to see a change over there”, is tany of this accurate?</p>
<p><strong>BOLTON:</strong> Thank you, I'm also very glad to be here in the briefing room, I know it's been a little while. But while I’m not in a position to comment on any executive-level discussions, especially not between anonymous sources, what I can tell you is that it remains the stated position of the United States government, that Cuba is a part of what we are being termed the Troika of Tyranny, and these countries are a threat to international stability and until a free and pluralistic government is created and sustained we don’t see our relationship with these nations moving anywhere.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">Army veterans and Counterterrorism Experts join ‘Jesse Watters Primetime’ to discuss the draft.</p>
<p><strong>Good evening, </strong>and welcome to Jesse Watters Primetime, tonight we’ll be discussing an issue that should be of great concern to everyone watching, in fact, it should be the most important issue to all Americans, and that’s national security. Our country right now is being threatened by all sides, we have the Chinese Communist Party, which is building up its military at a rate we’ve never seen before, and analysts claim that the country will be prepared for an all-out attack on the United States, in less than two years. China is partnering with Russia, and Iran to form an alliance, even stronger than the Nazis and Communist Russia combined, that alliance would be able to dominate America’s military in the air, on the land, and the sea. </p>
<p>In fact, most analysts believe it isn’t a matter of <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em> these powers decide to strike and destroy the American-based international order, which has protected the world for a century. Meanwhile, our military has been systematically degraded, and watered down by DEI hiring programs and woke ideology which is encouraging pacifism in our war-fighting machine, mandatory sensitivity training, and the same leftwing propaganda that is being put into schools, is now in our military. </p>
<p>What is the result of all this? Recruitment has dropped to its lowest level in history, even as we face threats to our south from the Caribbean, in Europe where our supposed allies are refusing to pick up the slack for their own defense and abandon our greatest allies in Israel. People like Kier Starmer, Olaf Scholtz, and Jean-Luc Melanchon these men are not friends of America or our President. The red menace, is at our doorstep watching and waiting for a moment of weakness, who’s to say it won’t come right after the election? When if somehow a Democrat is elected, we will again be seen as weak, we’ve seen that just this week as one by one Democrats lined up to denounce a new National Service policy, a plan that veterans agree is the only way to rebuild our armed forces. </p>
<p>In fact the supposed outrage against this plan is so great, that it’s convinced me that if a Democrat is elected, we won’t have a military to protect us at all, and just like the movie Red Dawn, our country will be attacked and occupied by Communist forces. I have with me tonight, retired Marine Sergeant Mike Stephens author of Woke Warriors, who endorses the draft plan, Alex what do you make of the left's hysteria over this?</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The authors of "Blowout," Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, tell Stephen some revealing 2020 election stories</p>
<p><span style="padding-left: 60px;">(Applause and Jazz)</span></p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN:</strong> Welcome back everybody, my guest tonight is a two-time Pulitzer prize winner and a national political reporter for the Washington Post, who’ve both written a new book called Blowout, please welcome Bob Woodward and Robert Costa<br />
<p><span style="padding-left: 60px;">(Applause and Jazz)</span></p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN:</strong> Hey fella’s always good to have you on, now I haven’t finished this book. Not because it isn’t a great read, but because it’s so damn long. I mean look at this thing, looks like it could stop a bullet. It’s thrilling, really front to middle, what you’re reporting, the chaos and the shock, I’ve read the earlier installments, and this one is a much better read to me, because, well, I know how it ends. A lot less tention, Did you, in the process of writing it get that same feeling?<br />
<strong>WOODWARD:</strong> Yes I did, there are obviously shocking anecdotes, the conversations people were having, behind closed doors, but practically everybody we spoke to, even foreign dignitaries in China, Russia and Iran, could see the wheels spinning off this thing, really just revealing how weak the United States was during this period. We really got into who was running the country, because the more we looked, it wasn’t Trump, he really wasn’t the point man on almost any issue.<br />
<p><span style="padding-left: 60px;">(Applause and Jazz)</span></p>
<p><strong>WOODWARD:</strong> You laugh, but we were going through a national security crisis, for months as things spiraled out of control, both in the government and in the campaign.<br />
<strong>STEPHEN:</strong> You get into some really interesting conversations with the Trump campaign team, was there any sense of strategy, because it seems from your reporting that no one had a handle on anything, people were getting fired, and catching Covid,, left-right and center, some even getting arrested. Did anything go right for these people?<br />
<strong>ROBERT:</strong> I’ve covered Washington for years, and there really was a complete sense of hopelessness in all the staffers we talked to, all the campaign people, at certain points, it almost seemed like they were trying to lose. Only really did the President, right up until election night really think he was in with a shot, throwing out all kinds of conspiracy theories, really fringe stuff, wanting to investigate the election, call it rigged, you know crazy stuff, thankfully none of that got anywhere.<br />
<strong>WOODWARD:</strong> When spoke with Trump as part of this book, a few months after the inauguration and it’s in the epilogue so I won’t spoil anything but he was fairly convinced that the RNC, Congressional Republicans some of his own campaign team, even Vice President Pence, were the ones that had really screwed things up for him., that if his instincts had been followed he would have had a stronger chance, but a part of me also thinks he's a little relieved.<br />
<strong>STEPHEN:</strong> Wow , that is intresting I wouldnt have thought that. We have to take a quick break but don’t go anywhere because after the break we’ll be talking about, what’s next for the Republican Party, so  stick around everone.<br />

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">A Review of Wolff’s Latest and Apparently Last, White House Tell-All</p>
<p>It seems the market will never run dry of Trump and friends’ literature, by now it has accumulated so many volumes it’s fair to call it a genre in of itself, ome librarys already have dedicated <em>Trump</em> shelves. Even right now, Wolff is competing with at least three other major works dissecting the President the Democrats and the 2020 election. Though it seems that perhaps that market is finally reaching its saturation point, and by Michael’s own admission he has no intention of covering the antics of the second Trump administration.</p>
<p>This book lacks the polish of the other two, the reporting is less sensational, and the depth of sourcing is much more trivial. Though Wolff is a gifted writer, it seems even he struggles to pull the reader into the drama. This is not an exhaustive investigation into the Trump 2020 campaign, and how it manifested its stunning victory, as the other recent Trump-centric bibliographies cover. This book tries to keep a tight focus on Trump, and the ever-rotating cast of characters and advisors that surround him. </p>
<p>The only time the book ever offers its insight into the actual political success of Trump. Is when the book describes Trump's political success as is almost preternatural, manifested entirly in Trump's brain and brought into existance with the kind of luck and foresight that is described in almose magical terminology. Trump both to his aides, party allies, and eventually the reader, just seems to apparate his awesome victory, and everyone around him is dragged along until eventually he is proven right and they wrong. There is little time spent on strategy, it’s about rallies, big numbers, and winning, which it seems is the entire combination. </p>
<p>When told as a narrative, something seems missing, who are the villains and heroes of the piece, the Democrats, they come off so comically inept, and Trump can't be called a hero or even an antihero with his motiviations consistently debated by the central characters. The book itself seems to vacilate between trying to understand Trump and mystifying him.</p>
<p>Until the writer himself seems to give up on the piece. We transition from election night to inauguration eve, without covering the turbulence in between, being left with a final interview between the President and Mr. Wolff, it’s braggadocios, and packed with unholy levels of self-flattery, but it’s the final words that stick with the reader and clearly with Wolff. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">A Year of Reckoning for Global Democracy Following the 2020 Election</p>
<p><strong>The United States Is Downgraded from Flawed Democracy to Hybrid Regime.</strong></p>
<p>The November 2020 presidential election attracted the highest voter turnout since 1900, with record numbers of the voting-eligible population casting ballots, and the American public is much more engaged with politics than ever, since the Democracy Index was launched in 2006. However, the supposed robustness of the country's democratic institutions was upended by the many failures and disputes throughout the Presidential election, which resulted in the disruption of the electoral procedure and a deadly riot at the U.S. capital and the subsequent overturning of the election results in a contentious decision by the United States Supreme Court, to discard many supposedly illegally cast ballots and subseqently re-elected President Trump.</p>
<p>These events and that decision has starkly set back the United States, reducing its <i>Electoral Process and Pluralism</i> ranking from 9.37 to 6.83. Looking ahead, new threats have emerged that also undermine the country's political institutions as at least 12 State Governors have refused to recognize the Supreme Court’s decision and insist that the President must resign from office and allow the United States Congress to appoint a new President, further increasing the US’s democratic deficit. </p>
<p>Overall the biggest threat the US democracy is further acts of political violence and the severe depth of polarization. Numerous figures within the President's administration have endorsed, authoritarian language, referring to “crackdowns” on protesters, and “suspending the Constitution”, and have threatened political rivals for commiting “treason against the United States”, this rhetoric combined with the worrying actions to eliminate large parts of the federal ‘bureaucracy’, and the forced adjourning of Congress has contributed to further institutional gridlock and functionally crippled the legislative process, especially when combined with the tragic deaths of legislators in Januaries upheaval, further widening divisions and leading to harsh government obstruction, reducing the <i>functioning of government</i> from 6.63 to 4.53.</p>
<p><i>Political culture</i> remains the weakest category for the US, with a score of 4.12 reduced from 6.25. Social cohesion has collapsed and consensus has evaporated on fundamental issues such as election outcomes, public health practices and the rule of law. According to an Axios-Momentive poll only 44% of Americans believe the Supreme Court was correct in the <i>Trump V League of Women Voters decision</i>, and a majority believe President Trump should be held responsible for the January 6 destruction.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding-left: 5em;">[Picture changes to Donald Trump and Xi Jinping]</span></p>
<p><strong>Colin Jost:</strong>Amid the ongoing combat between the United States and China, there are rumors that the Pentagon has moved to DEFCON 1, which could mean the nuclear war may be imminent, startling stuff but don’t worry President Trump set the record straight with the same sturdy and reassuring leadership that only he can provide.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding-left: 5em;">[Cut to a video clip of Donald Trump.]</span></p>
<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Mr. President, is there the possibility that this war could turn nuclear?</p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; padding-left: 5em;">[Cut to Colin]</span></p>
<p><strong>Colin Jost:</strong>Sure? A one-word answer, Donald Trump has spent the last four years talking about the size of his crowds, but when it comes to the possibility of a devastating nuclear war, suddenly he gets a little shy. And now Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding to know how this conflict will end, in responce the White House has only provided this image. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Picture changes to Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in bed together]</span> We can only hope.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">The Explosive Allegations made against the former Head of the Joint Chiefs Amount to High Crimes</p>
<p>Gen, Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted to making secret calls with foreign powers after the 2020 election. Under some hazy state of hysteria, the United States might authorize a nuclear attack against China in the Taiwan standoff.</p>
<p>Milley claims he coordinated calls with nearly nine countries, in complete secrecy completely sidelining the President of the United States and the civilian leadership of this country. These calls included hostile foreign powers, like China, Iran, and Russia. And where did we discover this, an illegal leak of classified Pentagon documents? A deathbed confession? No the front page of the New York Times! As part of an excerpt from Bob Woodward's new book <i>“Sentinel”</i> a puff piece on the General which claims he singlehandedly saved the world from nuclear Armageddon. </p>
<p>While the President of the United States was directing the military, into potentially hostile waters, General Milley was “Assuring members of the Chinese government and Military that the United States did not intend to enter the Zone of Exclusion”, and that “No kinetic force would be utilized in the ‘Sweeping Eagle’ Exercise or through the remainder of the Trump Presidency” Actions that can only be described as treason at best or a coup d’état at worst.</p>
<p>What is the response from these liberals who for years prophesized the imminent downfall of the Republic under Trump, now that we have factual confirmation that it actually happened will a November 30th Commission be established to investigate the hundreds of deep state apparatchiks who connived to disarm the United States in a standoff against China, will anyone go to jail, or be executed for these most heinous actions</p>
<p>I and any American who likes living under a democracy should, but already alongside Woodward's piece, Hollywood is now looking to base a picture on Milley, production studios pouncing on the book before it’s even been published, to make their latest Oscar bate melodrama where Milley will be portrayed as a selfless patriot, instead of the rotten traitor he really is.</p>

<p>Classified military documents have somehow, again, managed to get brought out into the light by a gaming community, and this time it doesn’t even has the dignity to be War Thunder.

<p><strong>These leaked documents,</strong> inevitably spilled out across the various Chan boards, and as the internet is often want to do they were shared as a means of winning arguments, the documents in question mapping out the direction of the U.S. Third Fleet, analysis of the Chinese blockade, estimates combat capabilities, and casualties, and spookily ponders the scenario where the Chinese forces might utilize battlefield nuclear weapons, or what would happen if Taiwan were equipped to bomb the Chinese mainland. This particular exchange caught my eye </p>

<br>
<p><strong>The documents</strong> were also shared on Chinese Telegram channels where edited versions of the document were shared with estimated casualty rates of the United States to be far higher than the Chinese and removed any indication of the nuclear analysis. </p>
<p> The Bellingcat investigation exploring the origins of this leak, didn't just identify the ‘dumb sources’ Minecraft Discord and 4Chan but also the potential impact that this leak has. “This is without a doubt one of the most serious intelligence failures in history, these are active war plans, not an analysis of previous battles, or a top-down logistical accounting or the theoretical analysis of some think tank, this has real-world implications”. However, when asked about other theorized origins of this leak, either from the Chinese government or an American whistleblower working to prevent conflict or confuse the enemy with phony intelligence, the analysis ultimately opts for Occam’s razor, “If it was one of those I would have gone to the New York Times, not a Minecraft Forum” </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">They split on abortion, Ukraine, and the 2020 election -- but all agreed on one thing. Trump</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Ten Republicans</span> vying to capture the Republican nomination to compete in the 2024 election took to the smallest debate stage of the cycle in Kansas City Thursday night, the anniversary of the death of former President Trump. With less than 10 Weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Thursday night's debate featured displays of both unity and division among the Republican ranks.</p>
<p>There has been no clear front-runner in the race to date but here are the five key takeaways from the Republican primary debate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong> Republicans Vye For MAGA Voters</strong></p>
<p>One name came up more than any other in Thursday's debate, Trump. By our count it was uttered by every candidate at least three times, and by some like Governor DeSantis, it was mentioned at least 30 times. It is clear that every candidate on that stage wants to associate themselves with the Trump legacy, Nikki Haley touted her role as United Nations Ambassador who stood up for Trump's Visionary America First Policy’, and Governor Abbott talked about how he would fight to complete and expand the ‘Trump Border Wall’, Congresswoman Cheney, and Mr. Carlson got into a particularly vicious debate, over who was more supportive of the 45th President, as Carlson branded her a ‘Never Trumper’. And Governors Noem and Sanders both opened up about personal stories about the former President </p>
<p>The strongest play for MAGA voters was made by Senator Ramaswamy, who has leaned into conspiracy theories regarding the death of the former President, claiming that the “Deep State has organized the deaths of powerful people before” and he questioned why the pictures of the President's fateful Walter Reed Hospital visit have ‘Never been released’. Lines that drew great applause from the sympathetic audience. Senator Rubio was mocked on stage for the claim that he had received the ‘endorsement’ of the Trump family even though that so far the Trump family has not released any kind of unified endorsement, Senator Lara Trump clarified that the Senator had indeed spoken to the family at Mar-a-Lago the Trump familial retreat which has since become a Mecca for aspirational Republicans but that no formal endorsement has been granted.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">President Pence Is Working To Gather Support For An Abortion Ban Before The New Congress Convenes</p>
<p>President Pence told a gathering of key Republican party leadership that he wants to see a 15 Week Abortion ban passed through Congress, prior to January when the new Democratic majority will convene to take its seats. </p>
<p>This last summer, the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in the United States, and Mr. Pence, a staunch advocate of pro-life and anti-abortion policies, has not shied away from promoting a federal ban as an issue. He also delivered what was described by Anti-abortion groups as an “unapologetically pro-life speech” to a gathering of supporters.</p>
<p>President Pence who has long made his evangelical faith, a key tenant of his political identity, has not backed down from his position, which is thought to have cost the Republicans greatly in this year's mid-term election cycle, losing a record number of seats to Democrats and costing the Republicans both houses of Congress. “Let me say from my heart, the cause of life, is the calling of our time, we must not rest, we will not rest until the sanctity of life is the final law of every state in the land”</p>
<p>The President made no mention through his speech of the supposed exceptions that would allow abortion in cases after 15 weeks, such as rape or incest, and the White House press spokesman has not returned a request for comment. </p>
<p>Congressional Republicans have largely adopted the President's 15-week policy, including Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who has told reporters he would be open to a 15-week ban if he could find a majority to support it.</p>
<p>However sensing political risk in the position, some Republicans have already backed away from the President's commitment, including some key voices like Secretary of Defence Nikki Haley, who called such a ban ‘A worthy aspiration, but politically fraught’. There are also some louder voices on the outside, such as members of the Trump family, Ivanka Trump released a statement in Instagram called a 15-Week No Exception ban ‘Political Poison’ That would “Permanently place a NO-WOMEN ALLOWED sign on the Republican Party”. This a post that has gained significant traction and only amplified the gap between President Pence and the deceased  former Presidents devoted MAGA (Make America Great Again) Supporters, a division that was on display at the C-PAC conference for the nations conservatives, which hosted few members of President Pence's administration, in favor of 'Trump Republicans' and the MAGA Caucus.</p>

      <span style="font-size: 20px;"> | 'The Sound of Trump' Review</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">
      PG-13 | 2h 11m | Biopic, Action, Thriller, Drama</p>
    <p>The buzz for <em>"Sound of Trump"</em> continues to power through its success at the box office, where it quickly dethroned many of the biggest movies out at the moment, including the new Terminator movie on its opening day.
    </p><p>A hugely polarizing film, <em>"Sound of Trump"</em> serves as a wake-up call, a moment when we realize that our country was indeed graced with a miracle of sorts. Possibly, the entire planet was saved from a scourge that could have ended life on Earth as we know it.
    </p><p>It's only been a few short years since our President was taken from us so mysteriously, but already it's hard not to see what has happened in the years since as some kind of divine intervention. If not the Lord directly, then at least indirectly through the public at-large, who through films like this will realize that we need to eliminate immoral smut and child pornography from our public spaces. Anyone who continues to partake in this cesspit of self-flagellation needs to reconsider. But more on this later.
    </p><p>First, the plot. <em>"Sound of Trump"</em> tells the true tale of real estate agent Mark Pillsner (played by Jim Caviezel), formerly a police officer, who comes to hear voices that mysteriously sound like those of the 45th President. Chastised over these 'delusions' by his wife and friends, Pillsner is none the less convinced, by the correct predictions the President's voice makes, and comes to be convinced by the voice that he must rescue a neighborhood child, whom the President tells him is being held captive. When the police fail to act on his, the film takes us on the fateful journey Pillsner must undertake, all under the instruction of the 45th President.
    </p><p><em>"Sound of Trump"</em> can be a tough, but I believe necessary watch, and I sincerely hope it opens the door to movies that tell similar tales. Coincidentally, while writing this review, I was sent a Facebook message by a friend who told me his mother was experiencing the same Presidential voice as Pillsner. It’s clear that the word of these events needs to spread further and wider so that men like Mark Pillsner are not forced to fight alone. <em>Because God’s servants are never alone.</em>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-top: -2px; text-decoration: underline;">It’s been really tough for everyone recently, especially due to the current events so obviously I had to bake something special</p>
<p>Hi y’all, I’ve been pretty down recently not just because of politics, ugh when will this chaos end, but because we might not get the great holidays we usually have. I for one missed out on the 4th of July celebrations this year, and feel that right now what our country needs is an injection of hig- in-sugar star spangled patriotism, so I bought everything I needed to make a fun classic. A beautiful cake with an American flag delightfully hidden inside and decided to share the recipe for this great addition to any festivity (even if your alone).</p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong><br><ul>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> a circular cake pan (I used 6″ pan because I wanted more height in each layer)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> a knife</li>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> a circular lid/cuter/bowl</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><ul>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> 1-3 circular cake pans (I only have one, three would make things quicker)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> 2 boxes of vanilla cake mix OR 1.5 of your favorite vanilla cake recipe (you need 3 layers of cake)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> frosting (2 store bought containers should do it, or your favorite recipe)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: color: black;"> gel food coloring in red, blue, and black</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; color: black;">
<li> Prepare the batter for your cake according to the box or recipe directions. Evenly divide the batter into quarters. Use a scale if you have it or eyeball it if you don't. [Note: Even though you're only going to use 3 out of 4 layers make all 4. If you use all that batter to just make 3 layers I don't think the cakes will come out well.]</li>
<li> Leave one quarter plain.</li>
<li> Add ¼ teaspoon red food dye and 1-3 drops black dye to one quarter of the batter. Mix and check to see if it's a color you like. Adjust the color until you have your perfect balance.</li>
<li> Add ¼ teaspoon blue food dye and 1-3 drops black dye to one quarter of the batter. Mix and check to see if it's a color you like. Adjust the color until you have your perfect balance.</li>
<li> Do what you want with the last quarter. Maybe leave it to bake until last then if one of the other layers comes out crazy you can use this as a replacement.</li>
<li> Bake the cakes according to the box or recipe directions.</li>
<li> Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool completely.</li>
<li> Once cool, cut the red and white cakes in half lengthwise.</li>
<li> Using a bowl, lid, or cutter cut out a circle from the middle of the red and white cakes. The hole would be about ⅔ the diameter of the cake. So if you use a 6" cake pan, cut a circle that's about 3.5-4" in diameter. Discard or set aside the outer rings, you won't need them. Set aside the small circles - you do need those. [Note: If you get confused about the cuts see the photo above in the main body of the post]</li>
<li> Using that same bowl/lid/cutter cut a circle out of the middle of the blue layer. Set aside the inside circle. You don't need it.</li>
<li> Place the large white layer on a plate or cake stand. Frost the top of that layer.</li>
<li> Place the large red layer on top of the frosted white layer. Frost the top of the red layer.</li>
<li> Put the blue donut ring layer on top of the red layer. Frost the top and inside of the blue ring.</li>
<li> Put the white small circle layer inside the blue ring. Frost the top of the white circle.</li>
<li> Put the red circle on top of the white circle. Cut off any excess red cake that is sticking above the blue layer.</li>
<li> Roughly ice the whole cake. Don't worry if crumbs are in the icing.</li>
<li> Put the cake in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes. This is to chill the icing.</li>
<li> Once the icing is slightly hardened, frost it again. This layer should be your pretty layer.</li>
<li> Decorate the cake as you desire.</li>
<li> Serve and watch your friends and family be amazed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you’re like me, and never clean as you go, you’ve got a tall task ahead of you now, but don’t worry, because now at least you get cake at the end.</p>

<p>Bill wearing a coat over his pajamas drenched to the skin, his streaky grey hair plastered across his slap, clambering through the entrance to the Television City Stage. Walking haggardly through the security, he fumbles in his pockets for a pass, instead, a guard lets him through.</p>

<p>Walking through the studio, people stop and stare, but Maher pays them no mind, murmuring under his breath. The production staff, pass on the news that he is here and that production may go on. Though they do not note his manner of dress.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>Director:</strong> Get ready to roll, this is our first in-person taping, if he’s in the studio, he’s doing it, did you get that.</p>
<p>The production staff nod, and gently usher Maher through the building, the monitors of the studio each one flickering his ghostly shambling. The people in the control room whisper back and forth, a member of the makeup desperately pad at Maher’s hair and tries suggesting a change of attire, but he seems completely out of it, totally mad. Instead leaping into the frame, and delivering his monologue to a confused production staff.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>Maher:</strong> (To camera) I don’t have to tell you things are bad, everyone knows things are bad, it’s the election. No one knows what’s going to happen. Everyone’s talking about it and everyone knows. The streets are run riot, everyone boarding up windows and battening down hatches, stocking their shelves. While the Antifa and the Maga run wild in the streets. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;">We know, the elections have been rigged, by the Russians and the Chinese and Iranians, and the Post Office, and the CIA. They tell us, it’ll all be sorted out by January, we’ll all know by then. Meanwhile, everything’s falling to shit. Things are worse than bad, it’s seems like everyone is going crazy, so we can’t go out anymore, we stay at home and look at our phones, and pray that they leave us alone, leave me with my free next-day delivery, and superhero movies and just leave me alone. </p>
<p>The people in the studio are at rapt attention including his guests each shifting uncomfortably in their seats.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>Maher:</strong> (Continued) I’m not going to leave you alone. I want you to get angry, I want you to get mad, I want you to say “Goddammit, the election was rigged, Covid was leaked, the President's a dictator, get out of your houses right now and stick your heads out the windows and scream “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore” </p>
