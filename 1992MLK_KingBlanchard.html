He wasn't able to hand the Democrats the White House in 1992, which not many understand why. It's possible that he was just too liberal for the country, he wasn't enthusiastic enough, or his anti-NAFTA sentiment didn't resonate to enough Perot supporters. Regardless, President George H.W. Bush has been re-elected to another four year term, giving the Republican Party sixteen straight years of White House control. </p>";
