A more moderate candidate, probably Hillary Clinton, will likely be nominated in four years, and they probably won't draw much of their playbook from you. Maybe if McCain completely bungles it, you can make a comeback of sorts, but that’s then, not now. Now, all you can do is watch how McCain handles the economy and Iraq in these next few years. With Democratic Majorities in the House and Senate, it’ll certainly be difficult for him."
