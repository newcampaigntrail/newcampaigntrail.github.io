Most people would celebrate becoming President but you find yourself on the edge of a panic attack. </p><p>‘Calm down, Jack.’ You hear an utterly familiar voice saying, you look up and see two older-looking men who’ve seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. ‘Are you Secret Service?’ you ask them still with a shaky voice. They only give a hearty laugh ‘My name is Joe.’ they both say at the same time. Twins, perhaps? ‘We aren’t Secret Service, fortunately, but we do have a vested interest in you, Mr. President.’ You get up out of your chair to look at them. ‘What the hell are you here for?’ you say accusatorily. They only laugh harder ‘To tell you the truth, normally we’d be here to kill you… Your timeline is an anomaly that shouldn’t exist, and we planned on killing you and resetting this universe back to 1987… but the boss seems to want to meet you personally.’ This is all a joke, right?  ‘Who’s this boss of yours?’ you ask them.</p><p>‘Just call him Brandon.’</p>"
