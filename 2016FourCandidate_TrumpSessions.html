Oddly, the Senate is tied, as Democrats managed to win back four Senate seats in November. Normally, that would throw the election into chaos, but Democrat Joe Manchin has heavily implied that he'll end up voting for Kasich, and a few other Democrats may follow him, leading to Kasich being narrowly confirmed, and giving Rubio full control of the Government. His narrow Senate majority will make it difficult to pass much of his legislative plans, but he will be able to replace Scalia, instead of Merrick Garland.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p> Your future is up to you.

In the House, Nancy Pelosi could change the rules to benefit Hillary, but Bernie Sanders complicates plans to change states to voting by plurality. Instead, the best they can hope for is a deadlock, although Rubio still could pull it out, depending on State delegation breakdowns. That would make the Presidency come down to the Vice Presidency, which is an even more bizarre situation, as the vote is between Tim Kaine and Tulsi Gabbard. Republicans could abstain, but if Tulsi has enough Democratic defectors, that would just lead to a Pelosi Presidency, meaning that Kaine will probably get a few moderate defectors. At best for Democrats, that would lead to a Kaine Presidency, or a Rubio Presidency with Kaine in second-in-command.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p> Your future is up to you.

What's odd is that Democrats have managed 4 flips in the Senate, taking the Senate to a tie. If it's a party-line vote, than that'd leave the nation without a Vice President, as Vice President Biden probably can't break the tie in Democrats favor, court-case pending. If this continues, Rubio may be forced to appoint a more moderate Vice President, but who knows, maybe he holds out until 2018, hoping for a Republican Senate majority.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>Next</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><p> It's not over yet, technically, but it isn't too late to consider your future plans.

If that happens, the next line would be the Democratic Senate, which has to pick between Tulsi Gabbard and John Kasich. Chuck Schumer is whipping votes to vote Tulsi, and if he manages that, Democrats could have full control of the Government in January, although some contest if Bernie is a 'real' Democrat, it'd be a major left-wing victory after Hillary got fourth. The future of the country relies on the strength of Pelosi and Schumers negotating.
